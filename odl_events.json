Outside, there is a large garden with beautiful views in every direction. If the weather is good we plan to have a  fire pit, marshmallows  and a chance to relax around a fire. If not don't worry, we have the cosy hostel for comfort, relaxing chatting, board games etc. There is no TV and WiFi is not brilliant, so a chance to socialise instead!\nThe small but well stocked village shop is a short walk away and provides all you may need, and there's a choice of excellent pubs in the village serving home cooked food.\nOn Friday night, we'll share the traditional OutdoorLads buffet (see food section) and Saturday and Sunday evenings will feature a home-cooked 2 course meal for us all to enjoy together (volunteers will be needed to chop, peel, grate etc). Continental style breakfasts are also provided on all 3 mornings, but you will need to bring your own packed lunch for Saturday and Sunday daytime (unless you are staying near the hostel in which case the village has pubs and cafes) .\nPARKING\n-\nThere is no parking on site\nFeel free to pull up at the hostel to drop your gear off though.\nYou can park in the village and surrounding area- just do so considerately . There are a couple of car parks as you enter Kettlewell   (£8 for up to 48 hours or thereabouts). On-street parking is limited, so arranging car sharing with others would be good.\nNote:\nBedding is provided. You may wish to bring your own pillow from home.\nDogs:\nThere will be two well-behaved dogs in attendance, unfortunately that is the maximum allowd so there are no more dog spaces available.\nPublic Transport\n- Kettlewell is on a\nbus route\nfrom Skipton or Grassington, or you could get a train to Skipton and arrange for a fellow attendee to give you a lift from there - most people will likely be passing through Skipton on their way.\nPhotos:\nBy L Russell and A Manion, and used by OutdoorLads with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Over this time, although some points of interest were replaced to make way for new fashions, the garden retains many early features, including the Canal Pond, Cascade and 1st Duke's Greenhouse.\nChatsworth has 105 acres of gardens to explore, and a couple of hours is a good amount of time to allow.\nFor food, there are plenty of options for varying hunger levels (detailed here:\nhttps://www.chatsworth.org/visit-chatsworth/shop-dine-stay/dine/\n) and we'll reconvene after lunch to walk round the gardens together - I will confirm timings for this in the pre-event message.\nPlease ensure you book your own ticket at the link above - booking online also include free parking.\nHouse timeslots are limited, so if you can't get on the 1100 timeslot, feel free to book one either side and join us for lunch/ the garden walk.  If you do book a different time, please let me know.\nAny questions, please drop me a message.\nImages taken by Phil_30.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

With its ruined stone buildings, old chimneys, and winding gear still standing, it offers a striking glimpse into the area's 19th-century mining heritage.

From there, we’ll nip across the A6 and begin a gentle climb up the inviting curves of Kirk Dale. The effort is well worth it: you’ll be rewarded with sweeping views over\nMonsal Dale\nand the lush valley below. A little uphill never hurt anyone, right?\nWe’ll flirt with the hillside and saunter through rolling farmland, slowly descending into\nBakewell\njust in time for lunch. You’ll have an hour to indulge yourself, whether you fancy unwrapping your own goodies for a riverside picnic or treating yourself to something hot and satisfying from one of the town’s many cafés or restaurants. Bakewell’s famous tarts and puddings are optional, but highly recommended—some things are just too good to resist.\nAfter lunch, we’ll ease ourselves back into action with a scenic stretch heading toward the\nMonsal Trail\n, skimming near the spot where the morning’s parkrun kicked off. Don’t worry—no sprinting required, just a steady pace and a cheeky smile.\nFrom there, we’ll pass through the picture-perfect villages of\nGreat Longstone and Little Longstone\n, before rejoining the Monsal Trail at the iconic\nMonsal Head\n. We’ll finish strong, taking the final leg back to Thornbridge through the evocative\nHeadstone Tunnel\n.

In the event of rainy weather, we may use less exposed routes with more shelter.\nOn the way back in the afternoon, if you are feeling tired, there will be an option to take a short cut, shaving 250m ascent and a mile and a half from the route if you're feeling tired.

We'll end our journey on the golden sands of West Wittering, ready for a refreshing swim and some seaside sun. This is a linear walk and we can relax on the bus back. Fresh air, fine views, and a frolic in the surf make this hastily-written alternative a worthy one.\nThe sights:\nBirdham:\nSome pleasant houses, especially the Westlands Estate. Birdham Pool was a tidal mill pond but became one of the first public marinas in the country in 1946. Chichester Marina is the chief attraction: a big rectangular harbour with sleek yachts along pontoons, created in 1966. St James' Church is big and bulky C14 but harshly restored in 1882.\nChichester Harbour AONB:\n'Chichester Harbour is one of the few remaining undeveloped coastal areas in Southern England...Its wide expanses and intricate creeks are at the same time a major wildlife haven and among some of Britain's most popular boating waters. The massive stretch of tidal flats and saltings are of outstanding ecological significance.' (From Wikipedia)\nWest Itchenor:\n'One short, nicely unpretentious street of cottages, mostly 18th century, running down to the water's edge.' (Ian Nairn,\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n). Huge waterside properties all around. From 1744 to the early C19 warships where intermittently made there.\nWest Wittering:\nAn attractive and exclusive village with large thatched houses and villas set in large gardens. Cakeham Manor was once a palace of the bishops of Chichester, now an attractive group of medieval, Tudor and Georgian parts. The tall brick tower of the early C16 stands out amid the flat fields.\nEast Head\nand West Wittering Beach:\n'One of the last surviving pieces of natural coastline in West Sussex. East Head is an example of the nationally rare and fragile, yet dynamic sand-dune habitat. Walk, play and sunbathe on the beach, which is considered one of the best in Sussex [it has Blue Flag status (see the\nwebsite\n)].' (From the National Trust website)\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them. Dogs are excluded from the main swimming beach at West Wittering but are allowed nearby. There are dog waste bins. Warm weather could be exhausting for dogs although we are close to water most of the way. Any dog off its lead must be under control.\nThe\nroute\n(please click on the link to see it)\n:\nStarting at Chichester Railway Station, we'll follow the New Lipchis Way all the way along the canal to the beach. After the beach, we'll walk to Cakeham Road to catch the bus back to Chichester.\n(Picture credits: Beach huts on West Wittering shoreline:\nPhoto\n©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n)West Wittering, Sand Dunes and Beach:\nPhoto\n©\nDavid Dixon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "This is a fairly level circular walk that sets off from picturesque Cotswold town of Bradford-on-Avon, notable for its 13th century Norman bridge flanked by large former cotton mills, nestled alongside the River Avon, and the Kennet and Avon Canal. While the walk route won't take us past the bridge, it is well worth a short trip into the town centre before or after the walk.\nFrom our start point we will set off south on the canal path before heading south west by Wild Brook and through open meadows and through Rufus wood towards Farleigh Hungerford Castle where we can take our lunch.  These medieval castle ruins where built in two stages. The inner court 1377 to 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford, steward to John of Gaunt. The second phase was completed around 1445 by Sir Thomas's son Walter Hungerford, who served with King Henry the 5th at the Battle of Agincourt.  Should anybody wish to, then there will be time to take a quick look inside the castle grounds during the lunch break, however English Heritage do charge an entrance fee to gain access to the ruins.\nAfter lunch we follow the River Frome north passing close to Iford Manor house whose origins may be as early as late 15th century. The classical manor house façade was added around 1730, and the hanging woodlands above the garden were planted later in the 18th century.\nFrom here we continue to the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon at Freshford before we arrive at the grade II listed Avoncliff Aqueduct which carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon and the Bath to Westbury railway line, and was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801.\nFor the final stage of the walk, we follow the River Avon and the Kennet and Avon canal back passing the spectacular 51 metre 14th Century monastic tythe barn of Barton Grange, which we can take a quick look inside, before arriving back in Bradford-on-Avon.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This will be an informal event, with team member(s) of the climbing centre there to offer advice and some supervision. The cost is the standard entry fee to the centre. Informal tuition will also be able from OutdoorLads, but this is dependent on numbers.\nAnyone can join the event, but please do sign up here so we can pass numbers on to the climbing centre.\nSo.... a bit about climbing and the centre..\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form. You can pay at the centre on arrival or online beforehand. If you pay in person at the centre a small discount is available if you mention you're with ODL.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nYes! Beginners are very welcome. If you've never climbed before, just let us know by messaging the event leader or co-leader, so we can arrange for you to be signed into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try. If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely. Please note that we are limited by the climbing centre as to the number of novice climbers we can supervise, according to the number of experienced people / staff available at the event.\nDo I have to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you can answer YES to all these questions, you can climb without supervision:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the UK. We are always keen to put more on, so if you fancy climbing in your local area contact a climbing leader and we can see what we can arrange.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by Keith\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is suitable for experienced outdoor lead climbers and those who are competent indoor climbers. To attend, you should:\nBe able to\nlead belay confidently\n(If you can't lead belay, message the event leader to confirm whether you can be accomodated based on the experience level of other attendees)\nBe\ncomfortable\nclimbing\nindoor routes graded 5A or above\nBe either already leading trad routes (placing gear) or looking to\nsecond a route.\nWe’ll typically climb in\npairs or small groups of three\n, depending on the number of attendees and the routes available and will match less experienced climbers with more experienced Trad climbers. Climbing in threes allows more opportunity for rest, observation, and learning.\nWhat is Seconding?\nIf you're\nseconding a route\n, you'll follow the climber who led the route up (see below for explanation on leading), placed gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) and attached the rope to the gear they placed. In a group of three:\nThe\nfirst second\nclimbs the route with the rope already in place, primarily focusing on movement and getting used to the rock. This climber does not remove any gear, but will need to unclip the rope and re-clip as they pass any protection.\nThe\nsecond second\nfollows after and\nremoves the gear\n(nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) that was placed by the leader. This is a vital role and a great way to build an understanding of traditional protection placements.\nSeconding allows you to experience outdoor climbing with less pressure than leading while still engaging with gear and rope systems. It’s an ideal way to build outdoor climbing experience before leading your own routes.\nWhat is Leading?\nThis person goes up the route first,\nplacing protection\nor gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) to protect themselves as they ascend.\nOnce they reach the top of the route, the lead climber's job is to:\nBuild a secure anchor\nusing fixed gear (like bolts) or traditional protection (nuts, cams, etc.)\nSet up the system so that the second can safely climb the route on\ntop rope\n(not to be confused with top roping indoors)\nAfter the anchor has been built, the role of belaying switches from the person on the ground, to the person who lead the route from the anchor they have built at the top of the climb.\nWhen second climbers ascend the route on top rope:\nThey are protected from above by the rope, so any fall is very short.\nThey climb to the top, and top out rather than being lowered back to the ground.\nThis event is\nnot suitable for absolute beginners\nor anyone who has not yet learned to lead belay.\nIf you’re unsure whether this event is right for your current level, just drop me a message, we may have some flexibility depending on group dynamics and experience levels.\nLocation\nBurbage offers a variety of climbs, and the team will ensure that you both enjoy your Trad Climbing experience but are also challenged. There may also be the opportunity to abseil/rappel down a selected route where a dedicated Group Abseil point will be established.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Another 340m of ascent will get us over Pen Cerrig-Calch (701m). It may be dark before we find a place to sleep (at an altitude of about 650m), so bring a low output head torch to use while walking and preparing to sleep.\nIn the morning we'll get to the top of Pen Allt Mawr (719m), for an early morning panoramic view across all of the Black mountains; followed by Pen Twyn Glas (646m) and then access the only reliable spring (so far), top up 0ur water and have lunch.  ( YOU NEED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS TO RENDER THE WATER FIT FOR YOUR CONSUMPTION).

Great for those wanting to get public transport from Manchester.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nDovestone Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve is ran by the RSPB and is home to many rare moorland species, most notably the peregrine falcon and mountain hares, which we'll see if we're lucky.\nAlphin Pike:\nThe first of our hills will be well earned after and long steep ascent from Greenfield. We'll be rewarded with fantastic views over to Manchester and back down to the lakes below.\nAshway Moss:\nOur second hill lies deeper into the moorland and gives a more remote feel. The heather will also start to bloom at this time, so the hills may have their purple blanket. Due to it's remoteness, this will be our best chance of seeing some of the animals that live here.\nThe Trinnacle:\nThis fascinating rock formation is looks over the valley below and will be a great picture spot. We won't be climbing onto the formation itself, as that would be beyond the scope of this walk.\nGreenfield Brook:\nAs we return back from the moorland, we descend down the beautiful Greenfield Brook. This will be one of the more challenging parts of the walk, as we'll need to take care coming down the rocky path.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nFor bouldering - absolutely!! There is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help you adjust and climb safely and effectively.\nThe main type of rope climbing on offer at this event is lead climbing, which requires those attending to have a basic understanding/introduction to Harnesses, knots and belaying first.\nSo after some consideration, we don't believe this particular event is suitable for complete beginners and we would recommend you have done your first session at one of our other events. However, if you have done\none session\nat another event and you are comfortable with climbing (or just need a refresher) please don't be put off! Sign up and let the leader know!

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nFor bouldering - absolutely!! There is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help you adjust and climb safely and effectively.\nThe main type of rope climbing on offer at this event is lead climbing, which requires those attending to have a basic understanding/introduction to Harnesses, knots and belaying first.\nSo after some consideration, we don't believe this particular event is suitable for complete beginners and we would recommend you have done your first session at one of our other events. However, if you have done\none session\nat another event and you are comfortable with climbing (or just need a refresher) please don't be put off! Sign up and let the leader know!

The leader will be staying at\nCwm Bychan\ncampsite overnight; though if you prefer more glamorous lodgings, there are some lovely B&Bs in nearby Harlech. If you just want to do this walk, that's fine too.\nThe Rhinogydd is the closest to a wilderness the Welsh mountains has, with the majority of the range being designated an Area of Special Conservation. There's an abundance of rare wildlife and geological interest, and if we're lucky; otters, red kites, hen harriers, mountain goats, adders and slow worms are a selection of the species we may see.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nCwm Bychan:\nMeaning the '\nsmall valley' ,\nthis gorgeous area is a mix of rivers, woodland and lake. Walking through the cwm will give us a good warm up before heading to the higher hills.\nThe Roman Steps Pass:\nAs we leave the cwm, we'll join the erroneously named Roman Steps - the route is actually a medieval packhorse track. The route cuts through some spectacular geological features seen no where else in Eryri, and is a great place to see reptiles basking on the rocks.\nRhinog Fawr:\nAt 720m, our first summit gives great views over the whole national park as well as the Irish Sea to the West. The mountains steep slopes are popular with the goats, so we may see them here.\nRhinog Fach:\nAt 712m, our second peak is everybit of rugged as the first, and summiting will be a good test of endurance, deep into the walk. Once on the summit we'll be greeted with more fantastic views, including the spectacular view back to Rhinog Fawr.\nLlyn Hywel:\nAs we return back from the mountains, we'll pass the beautiful Llyn Hywel, a natural lake with great views back to the mountain. The fish is home to wild trout and the cliffs by the llyn are home to some of the birds of prey that live in the range.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

There is even a\nParkRun event on the Saturday morning\nyou can join in with.

We'll start the evening at The Cold Bath Brewing Co, who brew their own range of beers in the very building! They also have a couple of own-brewed non-alcoholic brews too, alongside an impressive range of other beer styles.\nLater on, and depending on the mood, we'll move on to another local pub, to be decided nearer the time, to give a wider sample of Harrogate's night life!\nSo come and join OutdoorLads in Harrogate for a fabulous evening out!\nDogs\n: Are welcome at The Cold Bath Brewing Co, but I don't yet know if they are welcome at other venues we may visit.

The Stray is Harrogate's famous open parkland, and the course is three and a bit laps around the park.\nThe important bit... This is about personal goals. You run or walk, or run and walk,  at your own pace. Don't be scared that you may be slower than other people. Some walk, some run, some jog, some do a combination of all three.

Be warned though - it's addictive! I tried it once \"just to see\" and have now done over 100, in three different countries..\nThe official start of the run is 9am and we will meet at 8:40 for a quick catch up and attend the run briefing. Look for the red ODL flag that I'll attached to me somehow!\nThe official course event page is on the\nparkrun website here.\nIf you want to join the OutdoorLads' national group on the Parkrun website, on your Parkrun account select Profile, then groups and type \"Outdoorlads (UK)\" and click the Join button.\nIt's not the leader's local parkrun - I'm being a tourist too!\nIf visiting the area, there is an\nOutdoorLads social\nin the evening and if you are a leader, there is a North-East and Yorkshire\nleaders meeting starting at 11am\n.\nYou may also wish to sign up to the\nStrava OutdoorLads running club:\nhttps://www.strava.com/clubs/439735\nPhotos: By L Russell and W Allaway and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "People Attending": "12",
    "Summary": "Consider this maybe as more of a day out rather than just another walk!\nCome join our trip from Essex to Suffolk and back, including a return boat trip* to a lovely coastal peninsula, around which we will do a 10.6 mile (17km) walk. Much of it is through part of the Suffolk and Essex Coast Heaths national landscape and we'll be taking in 2 Estuary Rivers.\n(*Please note there is a charge of £15 per person payable for this event to cover the cost of the return boat trip needed to get to and from the Peninsula. The usual  non subscribed walk event fee of £12.50 will not be charged in addition for this event)\nOur day will commence initially on the Essex coast in the historic maritime port town of Harwich. Originating in the 13th Century, this is now the 2nd most busy ferry and freight port in the UK.  We however, will be embarking a very much smaller craft (as pictured) from the quiet little Harwich Half Penny Pier harbour for a 10-minute trip across the water to the Suffolk coastal Shotley Peninsula.\nFrom the attractive Shotley Point Marina, we'll then commence our circular walk. Initially heading along the harbour side and onto the outskirts of the small town of Shotley Gate, we'll then follow the banks of the Estuary River Stour. We'll follow the path as it meanders along the estuary banks until we head off across some lovely open Suffolk countryside across to the other side of the peninsula.\nWe'll then arrive at the small village of Chelmondiston - from where we'll head through some scenic low undulating woodland to get to the very pretty and rural estuary hamlet of Pin Mill. Aside from being a very cute place, Pin Mill is known best for it's pub on the little quayside - The Butt and Oyster.\nOf course, we'll make a stop here to take in quayside views and some liquid refreshment. The pub is quite small and very popular for food, so eating there wouldn't be practical for us sadly but we'll find somewhere in the vicinity to also enjoy our packed lunch.\nOnce refuelled, we'll make out way through the beautiful area known as the Cliff Plantation which, as the name suggests, is an old plantation woodland on some low-level cliffs alongside the Estuary River Orwell. Through the trees, there are glimpses of the water and some interesting wooden houseboats as we walk along the riverside path.\nThe continuing estuary side route then takes us on some boardwalks and paths with wide open views of the Estuary River Orwell. As we get closer back to our start point, there are impressive views of the busy Felixstowe Shipping Port across the other side of estuary, creating a unique mix of the rural path we'll be on with the industrial container port across the water.\nAs we arrive back at Shotley Point, we’ll wander through much more of the marina this time with great views of the boats and harbour activity.\nDepending on timings, we should then have time for another refreshment stop at a bar in the marina before we catch our return boat trip back across to Harwich.\n*Note - the high-level view photos of the Marina and the Butt and Oyster Pub setting are drone shots. But nevertheless, the views we'll get on the walk are lovely!\nIs it dog friendly?\n4 legged friends are welcome and are allowed on the boat crossing if you're happy to take them onboard, Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

As we reach the ridge, we will benefit from beautiful views across Guisborough and on towards Hartlepool. We will enjoy some time at Highcliff, before descending towards a more exposed area of moorland. Here we will pass Roland’s Close, the remains of five iron age circular huts, probably dating from early in the 1st century AD. They are named after their excavator who died in 1978 and are the sole example of their kind in North-East Yorkshire.\nAs we walk on, we pass through an exposed area of open moorland, home to sheep, black headed gulls and other wildlife. This part of the walk has no shade, so if it’s a hot day, please ensure that you have sun cream, a hat and plenty of water.\nWe descend through trees and farmland, before reaching the grand finale. The majestic remains of Guisborough Priory, that dates from the 12th century, will tower above you as we walk back towards Guisborough.\nAfter the walk, there will be an opportunity for a drink at Cookfellas courtyard garden, before we head home.\nView the\nOS Map of the planned walk\n.\nDogs: Well-behaved and under-control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request.\nIf this event is fully booked:\nPlease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event:\nIf this is your first event, we’ll make sure you feel welcomed.

The walk follows sections of the Oxfordshire way with gentle rolling hills, woods, stretches alongside the river Evenlode, in an area that was the inspiration for Tolkien's Hobbitshire.\nThe Sights:\nTolkien's Hobbitshire:\nJ.R.R. Tolkien’s vision of The Shire in\nThe Hobbit\nand\nThe Lord of the Rings\nwas inspired by the rural landscapes of Oxfordshire, where he lived and taught at Oxford University. The rolling hills, woodlands, and villages, especially areas like Wychwood Forest, Charlbury, and the Evenlode Valley, influenced his depiction of Hobbiton.\nThe Oxfordshire Way:\nis a 68-mile long-distance walking trail across Oxfordshire, starting at Henley-On-Thames, going through the Chiltern Hills and ending at Bourton-on-the-Water. We will follow a stretch from Kingham to Shipton-under-Wychwood.\nKingham:\nis renowned for its honey-toned stone cottages and tranquil village green. It was named \"England’s Favourite Village\" by\nCountry Life\nmagazine in 2004. We won't see the village centre during this walk, but if you arrive early then feel free to explore (it's over 1 mile away from the station though).\nBruern Abbey:\nbegan as a Cistercian monastery in 1157, but now a Georgian manor house sits on the former abbey site. Today it's a specialist school for boys with learning difficulties.\nShipton-under-Wychwood:\nonce part of the Royal Forest of Wychwood, and features a 12th-century church, a successful cricket club and access to nature reserves including Wychwood Wild Garden and Bould Wood.\nAscott-under-Wychwood:\nknown for its medieval castle remains, 13th-century Holy Trinity Church, and the story of the Ascott Martyrs — 16 women jailed in 1873 for supporting striking farm workers.\nCharlbury\nis a market town known for its Saxon origins and medieval market charter from 1256. It was once a centre for glove-making and has a strong Quaker heritage. The town sits on the edge of the ancient Wychwood Forest, has a museum and hosts the popular Riverside Festival and the World Aunt Sally Championship!\nThe route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Kingham Railway station, we will shortly cross a river and briefly enter Gloucestershire and the village of Bledington. Here we will pick up the Oxfordshire Way, which we will follow for much of the route, following the River Evenlode through fields and woodland. We will see the ruins of Bruern Abbey on the other side of the river. At the village of Shipton-under-Wychwood we will stop for lunch. After lunch we will continue onto the village of Ascott-under-Wychwood where we have the option of a pub stop for a drink. We then cross the railway line and river and follow the Oxfordshire Way from the other side through an area of open pasture and woodland. Eventually we will see the church tower of Charlbury in the distance and the final section takes us through the centre of Charlbury where we will finish the walk, and from here it's a short 5-10 minute walk to the railway station,\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead.

Considering the socials and walks that are held in and around Southampton I'm sure most will agree its important our presence is felt and our profile is raised.\nSouthampton's first Pride event was held in 1992, and was known as Solent Pride. Since then, in 2016 Southampton held its first Pride event in over a decade. This marked a significant event for Southampton's LGBTQ+ community. Since then Southampton has held a Pride annually, and it has grown to what we see today.\nWe will meet in Queens Park between\n10.30 - 10.45\n.\nThe march will leave Queens Park at\n11.00\nso its important to get there in good time. I would ask, if possible, to wear your red OutdoorLads t-shirts. If you don't have this, wear any other branded OutdoorLads clothing where possible. Of course, you are still welcome to join whatever you wear. Please bring OutdoorLads flags, whistles, rattles, anything to make noise and get us noticed. It is a protest after all! lol. Hopefully, we will be able to provide banners etc.\nThe march tends to last between 30-60 minutes before ending around Guildhall Square, where we will disperse. We may have a stall advertising OutdoorLads further, though this is yet to be determined. There will be performances from various artists on the main stage and a party atmosphere in the square which you are welcome to stay for. There will be other stalls and locals pubs and clubs in the vicinity. Bedford Place which is close by usually has a buzzing atmosphere.\nIt will be a very busy day, and I'm sure many local roads will be closed. I would strongly recommend to catch public transport into town where possible, and leave plenty of time for your journey, both in and out of Southampton.\nIt would be lovely to see as many people there as possible.",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "An exploration of the Yorkshire Wolds in a much underrated area of Yorkshire approximately 20 miles east of the city of York, starting in the pretty village of Millington and visiting Givendale, Grimthorpe Wood, Mile Fields, Pocklington Woods and crossing the greens of the local golf course. Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.   We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.  This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat!  Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby.  This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food!  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories!  Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend.  The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.  From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location.  It is much easier to park in the village and walk down.  There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "On this one-way, westward walk along part of\nThe Wales Coast Path\nwe will find some interesting and scenic terrain, as well as some man-made features. Our starting point at the port of\nAmlwch is the northernmost town in Wales\n, and you’ll also pass the northernmost point of the Wales Coast Path at Llanlleiana Point. The return will be made by bus.\nInitially we will pass the area’s now derelict industry, including crossing the old railway and the old bromine works on Trwyn Costiog that looks like a set for a 1980s Dr Who episode. After Porth Wen, with its ruined brickworks, the path passes down and back up a feature known as Hell’s Mouth. A lookout tower built in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII marks Wales’ most northerly point. We encounter some more industrial ruins, those of the Porth Llanlleiana China works, which add a certain beauty to the landscape. The walk then follows spectacular clifftop paths, before reaching the church at Llanbadrig (translates as Patrick’s Church) as St Patrick was reputedly shipwrecked at the nearby island of Ynys Badrig. This is a church and graveyard with a superb view, and those with an interest in history can pop in to see the early Christian sculpted stone known as the Ichthus Stone.\nFrom Porth Padrig, the final section around Trwyn y Parc and into the fishing port of Cemaes, where the sandy beach makes it popular with tourists, and it’s a perfect place to end before catching the bus back.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved  and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.

In addition to the wildlife, throughout the walk we'll see reminders of the impact that WWII had on the area (e.g. tank traps, ruins of buildings, anti-aircraft gun mountings).\nThose of you who wish can visit the Easington Lighthouse (the tallest in Northern England) if it is open on the day. Access to the ground floor is free but entry to the upper levels is £4 adult/£3 concessions.\nPlease see the website for further details\n.\nContinuing on, we'll go past the RNLI station houses and boat launch which, sadly after 213 years of sea rescues, is now\nclosed\n. Toward the end of the peninsula we'll see the ruins of Spurn Point gun batteries and other defence-related structures.\nThere is a visitor centre and cafe near the car park, which has toilet facilities.\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the parts of the reserve that we will be accessing.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Dinner will be included but will be simple for those that might not arrive till later (probably jacket potatoes with a range of fillings).\nSaturday Daytime:\nAfter breakfast, it will be time to explore some of the stunning countryside surrounding Llanthony.  Prepare for a climb as no matter which way you look, the site is surrounded by hills and mountains, and we will be going up at least one of these to reach the views from the ridge lines.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax and unwind.

There's the option to walk the 50m or so to the cellar bar at Llanthony Priory or perhaps just read a book by that wood burner.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast we'll need to clean and tidy the barn, but once everything is packed away there will be an option to head to Longtown (either by foot or by car) for a Sunday lunch before heading home.\nTea and coffee will be available throughout the weekend but you'll need to bring a packed lunch for Saturday and anything else you may want to drink (The Cellar Bar does offer 2 Pint Takeouts of the draft beers)\nDogs:\nDue to the limited social and sleeping spaces this event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South Wales events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWalesNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This is a unique location in the heart of the best the Cotswolds has to offer.\nNestled in the unspoilt Evenlode Valley, close to Burford and a stone’s throw from Stow, our home for an extended weekend (THREE NIGHTS starting Thursday) will be a woodland camp exclusive to OutdoorLads on a private estate at the invitation of the owners.\nThe camping is in our own private glade and you will be free to pitch wherever takes your fancy. Each night we will have a campfire and gather at the fire circle to share stories and make new friends, or reacquaint ourselves with old ones.\nThursday night will be an orientation evening, getting to know the estate and the surroundings.\nOn Friday there will be canoeing at Lechlade - a 20-minute drive away on the Upper Reaches of the River Thames, or a long country walk starting directly from the campsite.\nSaturday will see us head out for more serious walking… once again directly from camp and taking in some of the most glorious rolling countryside in England, returning to camp for relaxation before our catered BBQ on Saturday night, which is included in the event price.\nOn Sunday there will be the opportunity to visit the private gardens of the estate house itself.\nThere is also a farm shop and café where you are invited to have breakfast and to relax for a drink or a meal at any time during your stay (during opening hours 9am – 4pm)\nWe do so hope you can join us for this fabulous chance to enjoy a seriously chilled late summer vibe in a very relaxing place indeed.\nPlease note that this is not a commercial campsite and therefore there are no formal facilities except two gay portaloos which we will be providing for the duration of our stay.

It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as\nMonkchester\nbefore taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882.  Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. Today, the city is a major retail, commercial and cultural centre.\nThe above text is freely adapted from Wikipedia, the full Newcastle page being accessible\nhere\nWhat’s going to happen\nItinerary:\nDay 1:\nArrive late afternoon on Friday, meet & greet reception before heading off out for dinner and drinks.\nDay 2:\nA leisure\ncity morning walk\nwith local guide - (£10 - not included in event price.)\nThis is followed by an optional afternoon visit to\nthe Victoria Tunnel\n(£17.60 - also an additional cost.)\nIn the evening we will reconvene at the hostel before heading out for an evening meal. Leading onto the nightlife of Newcastle's gay scene and joining up with a local OutdoorLads members social.\nDay 3:\nSunday morning, free time before checkout - with option of a local short walk.\nAccommodation\nHostel accommodation - 2 x  6 bed ensuite rooms which will only be shared with those attending the city break.\nPlease note that unlike most of our other hostel breaks food is not provided and we will not have sole use of the hostel, however you will only be sharing a room with other OutdoorLads members.\nIs it dog friendly?\nUnless you need a guide/assistance dog, this unfortunately isn't an event for our four legged friends.\nImage credits:\nwikimedia commons and user MartieBear\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

From there we will pass Cambridge United's Abbey Stadium and follow Coldman's Brook, a minor tributary of the Cam, along the edge of Coldman's Common.\nWe will then turn westwards into the suburb of Romsey and pass Cambridge Central Mosque, nominated for the 2021 Stirling Prize for architecture. Heading along the vibrant Mill Road we will cross the railway and enter the Petersfield area, where our route takes us via the leafy Mill Road Cemetery. We will then weave our way between Victorian terraced houses before reaching Parker's Piece, a large open space where the rules of modern football were codified.\nFrom Parker's Piece we will continue via the tree-lined Christ's Pieces and head into the historic city centre. We will pass the Guildhall, Great St Mary's Church and of course King's College Chapel. Crossing to the western side of the river, we will see the famous Mathematical Bridge, before turning northwards along the Backs with its fine views of King's. We will then pass Gonville & Caius, Trinity and St John's Colleges as well as the 12th-century Round Church, inspired by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nThe final section of our walk meanders alongside the Cam past Jesus Green and Midsummer Common. We will make a short detour to the remains of a 13th-century priory before heading back to the river to the Cambridge Museum of Technology. There we will stop for a well-deserved drink at The Engineer's House, a beer garden with a pleasant riverside atmosphere. From there it is an easy stroll along Stourbridge Common back to Cambridge North.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "A manhood or two might well be seen on the isolated naturist beach we'll visit, but Manhood is also the name of the peninsula that stretches south from Chichester to Selsey Bill. It is a strongly horizontal landscape of contrasting blocks of colour. Wide golden wheat fields and broad brown mudflats are backed by big skies, while the regular rows of poplars, the massed masts of yachts and the sporadic spires of churches provide vertical punctuation. Much of the area has been reclaimed from the sea and is drained by the ditches we'll follow, along with the Chichester Canal. The scattered settlements domesticate an expanse so flat that despite walking 17 kilometres, we'll not climb at all.\nThe sights:\nThe Manhood Peninsula:\nThe southernmost part of Sussex and part of the Sussex coastal plain. Bordered to the west by Chichester Harbour and to the east by Pagham Harbour. Its name comes from the Old English\nmaene-wudu\nmeaning \"men's wood\" or \"common wood\", i.e. common land.\nChichester Canal:\nOpened in 1822, its last load was transported in 1906. Runs 4.5 miles (7.2 km) from Birdham to Chichester. Some of its length is still navigable and the towpath is a popular route.\nSidlesham:\nSet among cornfields are half a dozen scattered hamlets, the nicest being Sidlesham Quay beside Pagham Harbour, which looks like a miniature Bosham. We will have lunch here. The historic\nCrab & Lobster\npub has a lovely garden.\nPagham Harbour:\nA glorious, tranquil area of saltmarsh, mudflats, saltings (for salt extraction) and shallow lagoons. Precious for wildlife as it's an SSSI, a Local Nature Reserve and a Ramsar Site. You could see curlew sandpiper and shelduck on the mudflats and long-tailed tit and willow warbler in the hedges.\nChurch Norton:\nJust the chancel remains from an old church, simple C13, with some fine tombs. The setting is the remarkable thing: surrounded by trees and almost on the shore, the leafy, isolated locale is rare on the Sussex coastal strip. The secluded shingle spit nearby is a nudist beach. The sea water is always clean as there are no sewage outfalls nearby. You're invited to check the quality at Southern Water's\nBeachbuoy\nsite or at the\nSurfers Against Sewage\nsite.\nThe\nroute\n(please note that this is a linear walk. A bus will take us back to Chichester)\n:\nWe'll leave Chichester by way of the canal and walk along it to Hunston. At Hunston, we'll walk to Hunston Church along Church Lane. We'll then use footpaths to go to South Mundham and use Fisher Lane to Fisher Farm. Further footpaths will take us to Bramber Farm and Honer Farm. We'll then walk around Paghan Harbour to Halsey's Farm and then pretty Sidlesham Quay for lunch. We could also have a drink at the Crab & Lobster pub. Further walking around Pagham Harbour will bring us to the hinge of Pagham Harbour Spit at Church Norton for a break and a swim. Footpaths and then a walk along Grange Lane and Rectory Lane will take us to the B2145 and the bus stop.\nGetting the bus back:\nThe No. 51 Stagecoach bus departs for Chichester every 30 minutes (at 33 and 53 minutes past the hour). It takes around 30 minutes to walk from the beach to the bus stop. The fare is £3, payable by any means.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There is sea for them to splash in but little shade. Dogs are permitted at Church Norton Beach but there are no poop bins. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Image credits: Shingle beach south of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View north across Pagham Harbour; Photo ©\nIan Cunliffe\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Leisure pursuits; Photo ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Gate on footpath between Honer Farm and Halsey's Farm: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Breach Pool north of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh at Sidlesham Quay: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bremere Rife with reed bed: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh, Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pagham Harbour: foreshore north of Church Norton: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A Several - one of several: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); and View northwards along the shingle ridge, Selsey East Beach: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). All pictures are copyrighted but are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA 2.0\nand are here attributed to their copyright holders.)",

From there the going is a little easier as we continue along and up the ridge to\nHelvellyn\n’s summit (925m), and then continue, descending a little at first to\nWhite Side\n(863m) ticking off the final Wainwright of the day, before the descent, down the old-pony route, over Brown Crag and back to our starting point.\nAlthough this is a 'ridge walk', it's not technical, however the ascent and descent are steep and sustained, and the distance (c.16Km/10miles) and ascent (c.1,050m) will make this a long \"mountain day\".\nThis\nis the intended route.\nFor those wanting the more technical option - I plan to lead a \"Saturday-Scramble over Helvellyn's edges\" towards the end of the summer!\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.

(Sorry no Hybrid or Gravel Bikes)\nThis is a good (for good read big) day out nearly 30k in length and with 900m of ascent a good pair of legs will be put to the test.\nWe start by taking the first climb of the north Face Trail (which is probably the best bit of the TNF trail….) After gaining height on this technical climb we leave the forest for while well head south on the open ridge that is Parkamoor. With views down to Coniston water this is the highlight of the day.\nAfter a few more ups and down we get to climb the amusingly named  ‘Breasty Haw’, and then bounce hard and fast down her. The final climb is steep, but takes us to the Grizedale Fox (cue cheesy team photo)\nA last descent on potatoes and baby’s heads takes us back to the visitor center in time (hopefully) for for tea and medals….\nThis day ride is only suitable for experienced mountain bikers on good mountain bikes. (Not suitable for beginners or hybrid bikes, sorry!)\nThese MTB events are open to everyone. You don't have to be part of the Langdale Camp event.\nHowever, for those that are, aim to leave by 08:30 and then drive to the start of the ride\nThe Langdale Valley is an amazing location with many options of walks, climbs, rides and more from the campsite or within a short drive we can explorer further afield.\nThere is camping for the\nfive day event\nof the Lakes Activity Week, arriving Tuesday and departing on Sunday.\nThe Great Langdale NT Campsite is a short walk to several pubs for the evenings but there are many other places to stay including the Old Dungeon Gill Hotel, New Dungeon Gill Hotel, Langdale Hotel, Elterwater Hostel, Baysbrown Campsite, Great Langdale Bunkhouse & more.\nPlease sign up to any Biking events you fancy as below:-\nOff-Road events\nWednesday - Whinlatter\n-Easy to intermediate (bike hire available )\nThursday - Kentmere\n- Challenging\nFriday - Little Langdale\n- Easy, straight from the campsite\nSaturday - Borrowdale Bash\n- Challenging\nSunday - Parkamoor\n- Intermediate (bike hire available )\nParticipation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the Participation Statement at\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/CyclingParticipation\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event.\nPhotos:\nTaken by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

    "Summary": "The\nGrace Dieu Priory\nwas an independent Augustinian priory founded around 1235-1241 and dissolved in 1538. Today the site is managed by the Friends of Grace Dieu Priory, a charitable group of volunteers who fundraise to care for the site, and keep it open to the public for free.\nThe priory is reputed to be the site of frequent paranormal phenomena, sometimes attributed to the priory's proximity to the Thringstone Fault, several ley lines and some possible Pagan significance attached to the site. The ruins are home to the mythical ghost the White Lady.\nMount St Bernard Abbey\nis a Roman Catholic,\nCistercian,\nmonastery founded in 1835. The abbey was the first permanent monastery to be founded in England since the Reformation, and it is the sole Trappist house in England. The monks brew the only Trappist beer in Britain which is available for sale from the gift shop.\nBlackbrook Reservoir\nwas constructed in 1796 in order to feed the Charnwood Forest Canal, which has long since vanished. The first dam constructed was an earthwork one that failed 1799. In eleven minutes, the reservoir was empty and local farmland was ruined, sheep were drowned, and much of Shepshed and nearby Loughborough were affected by flood waters.\nThe dam was repaired in 1801, but the canal was no longer commercially viable. The present gravity dam was constructed in 1906 and in 1957 it felt the effects of a magnitude 5.3 earthquake. The tremors caused heavy coping stones to shift, and cracks appeared in the faces of the dam.\nThere is an option to visit the\nBull's Head\npub for a drink (and food) after the walk.\nDogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead when required and under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked, please\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

    "Summary": "Please note the change of date for this walk and cancel if you can't attend on the new date. Frensham Great Pond was closed for swimming on the original date because of an algal bloom. Sorry for any inconvenience.\nYou might want to pack your trunks along with your lunch for this one. To be honest, the walk, on the pine-forested, bracken-covered, steep-sided knolls of Bourne Woods will neither be that tame, nor the swim, in the sandy-bottomed, lifeguard-supervised, top-rated waters of Frensham Great Pond, that wild. If you'd rather not swim you can enjoy a leisurely lunch break lolling on the sandy beach or visiting the cafés. Bonus features of this walk include the pretty village of Frensham, and the National Trust-protected woods and heaths roundabout, but the centrepiece will be (weather, crowds and blue-green algae permitting) a summertime splash in a superb setting.\nThe sights:\nFrensham village:\nSt Mary's Church dates from 1239 and contains many original features, despite restoration. There is also a large cauldron which allegedly either belonged to the local witch Mother Ludlam, or the fairies.\nFrensham Great Pond, Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Commons:\nThe lakes are 12th-century fishponds created for the Bishop of Winchester. The Commons that surround them are important SSSIs, home to Dartford warblers, sand lizards and nightjars, and managed by the National Trust. In World War II the ponds were drained, but they were subsequently restored and became a popular spot for London daytrippers in the past and the film and TV industry forever since (for example\nCarry on Jack\n(1963),\nCarry on Columbus\n(1991) and\nThe Mummy\n(1999), doubling as the River Nile). Waverley District Council run a café and toilets next to the Great Pond where the swimming takes place.\nBourne Wood:\nSilver birches and pines cloak a knoll in which a clearing affords lovely views over Farnham and surrounding woodland. Here, the Forestry Commission and RSPB have to balance the needs of nature, recreation and, notably, the UK film industry as it is frequent film and TV location (including\nTenko\n,\nIt Ain't Half Hot Mum\n,\nGladiator\n(2000) (where it stood in for the forests of Germania), various\nHarry Potter\ns,\nWar Horse\n(2011),\nThor: The Dark World\n(2013) and\nNapoleon\n(2022). See\nhere\nfor a list of films shot here.\nSwimming at Frensham Great Pond:\nSwimming isn't compulsory or prolonged and it will coincide with our lunch break. The two designated swimming areas are not large, or deep, but are enough to cool off. The water is clean-smelling and slightly silty. The water quality, regularly sampled, is generally rated 'Excellent' or 'Good' but after prolonged spells of warm weather blue-green algae can bloom and preclude swimming. I will, of course, monitor the situation.\nDogs are not permitted on the beach but can go near the café and walk through the site.\nIn very warm weather the pond and adjacent beach gets busy and people are warned to stay away as the car park closes (which won't affect us). We will see how we feel about the situation on the day. Check for more details\nhere\n.\nDogs\nI love having dogs on my walks, and this is a good dog walk as there is little livestock to be encountered, abundant heathland over which the dog can run free and trees to provide shade. However, there will be some roads to cross and short stretches of road walk along. Furthermore, dogs are not permitted on the beach at the pond and hot weather could be exhausting for them.\nThe route\n(please click the link\nhere\n)\n:\nA range of pleasant and prosperous suburban streets will lead us through The Bourne, Shortheath and Boundstone (in short, the southwestern suburbs of Farnham) to Rowledge. Switchback Lane will take us to Frensham Heights School and a lane will take us east to Broomfield Lane to Shortfield Common. Footpaths heading south will take us to Frensham village and then Frensham Common. Bearing east after lunch, we'll walk from the Great Pond to the Little Pond. We'll then head northeast to cross the River Wey and cross The Reeds Road. We'll head northwest across Farnham Heath and Bourne Wood and go through Lower Bourne along suburban streets back to the station.\n(Images credits: The beach, Frensham Great Pond; Sandbank, Frensham Common; and Sandy tracks, Frensham Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nAlan Hunt\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Path into Bourne Wood and Path on Tankersford Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Small Ford on Grange Road:\nPhoto\n©\nNigel Mykura\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Little Pond view from the west side:\nPhoto\n©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "Please note the change of date of this walk and cancel if you can't attend. My apologies for any inconvenience.\nThis walk uncovers some beauty and interest (and allows a swim) amid the sprawling seaside suburbia typical of the south coast. Half the walk will be suburban but half will be rural. First, we'll cross Highdown Hill, which is more prominent topographically (the views are superb) and mythically (the resting place of Saxon kings) than its modest height of 81 m suggests. Second, and after a visit to the freebie Highdown Gardens, we'll cross bungalowland to see flint cottages and farms and a private estate. In the latter, a house designed by a Bauhaus master and then an art deco garage will bring a dash of international chic to all the mock-Tudor mansions.\nThe sights:\nAngmering:\nBuilt inland on two hillocks with a green inbetween. Not yet swamped with houses like its seaside suburb of Angmering-on-Sea at East Preston. St Margaret's Church is mostly by noted architect SS Teulon, as is the school and vestry hall opposite. All display his characteristic complex planning and polychrome brick, except for the C12 chancel arch and tower. A very pretty village centre with flint cottages, manicured lawns and lush planting.\nHighdown Hill:\nA small but isolated promontory off the main South Downs belt, just 81m high but giving great views. In the property of the National Trust and the traditional burial-place of the Saxon kings of Sussex. Late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC) enclosure and early Iron Age (around 600 BC) hill fort. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery with around 90 graves has been excavated. In the C18, local miller John Olliver had his tomb built on the hill 27 years before his death in 1793. It is said that he was the leader of local smugglers and used the tomb to store contraband. He would set the sails of his windmill at different angles to indicate the absence of customs men to his followers out at sea. A runaway millstone from Ecclesden Mill is said to have given its name to a local farm and now garden centre.\nKingston Gorse:\nIn Angmering parish, a private estate of 'individually designed houses built after 1930 but mostly 1960s or later larger replacements offering a good chance to see many cliches of domestic design' (The Buildings of England - Sussex: West (Williamson, Hudson, Musson and Nairn)). Of the three best houses of the Modern Movement, only one is visible: Sea Lane House, 1936-7 by Marcel Breuer with FRS Yorke. Marcel Breuer worked at the Bauhaus where he was mentored by Walter Gropius before working in Britain between 1933 and 1938. His most famous work is the Wassily Chair.\nFerring:\nAn old flint cobble village swallowed up by seaside bungalows, typical of the Sussex coast from the Witterings to Lancing. The core, by the C13 roughcast church of St Andrew, along Church Lane is quite pretty.\nEast Preston:\nA few old cottages near the church among the well-to-do suburbia. St Mary the Virgin, C12 with a C19 aisle added by Sir George Gilbert Scott as the population expanded. Actor and comedian Stanley Holloway (1890-1982), famous as Alfred Doolittle in\nMy Fair Lady\n, is buried in the churchyard. Private estates were built between the old centre and the sea as part of Angmering-on-Sea Garden Village. Mostly big thatched cottages built at the end of the Arts and Crafts style, some mock-Tudor houses and a remarkable survival, a garage of 1929 given an up-to the-minute frontage in 1934 in a cool\nmoderne\nstyle. The Shell petrol pumps from the late 1930s/early 1940s remain. Now converted into flats.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe start by heading north from Angmering Station up Station Road to Angmering village centre. Heading east along the High Street ascend Highdown Hill which we'll descend after seeing the fort ramparts and having lunch. After crossing the A259 and railway line we'll briefly head west and southwest through the suburbs of Ferring and cross Ferring Rife to go to Kingston Gorse and the beach. We'll then head east along the beach and turn inland at Sea Road. After detouring to see the garage we'll head north through East then West Preston and go back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this is a near-perfect summer walk for them if it is not too hot: it'll be cool in the trees, even cooler in the sea, and it's not too long. There are some lanes to walk down and busy roads to cross but they can run free on Highdown Hill and Kingston Gorse beach. Dogs are not permitted in Highdown Gardens, so dog owners will have to wait in the tea rooms or bar.\n(Picture credits: Beach Huts, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n;\nLooking Eastwards down Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; The Nineteen Acres, The In Close, Upper West Field by\nSimon Carey\n; Trig point on Highdown Hill by\nRobin Webster\n; Highdown Hill by\nSimon Carey\n; The Miller's Tomb by\nDavid Martin\n; Highdown Hill by C\nhris Thomas-Atkin\n; Looking West from Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; Windmill on the downs above Angmering by\nDavid Martin\n; Post box in the wall by\nSandy B\n; Enjoying the Coastline by\nSandy B\n; Kingston Beach by\nSimon Carey\n; Ferring Rife by\nPeter Webster\n; Maytree Cottage/ Evergreen Cottage, Church Lane/Ferring Street, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n. Images permitted for use under Creative Commons License\nCC BY-SA 2.0\n.

    "Summary": "A beautiful circular walk from Dorchester, around the historic site of Maiden Castle and then going up Came Down! With panoramic views across Weymouth and Portland to the south and Dorchester and surrounding areas to the north. Walking along the chalk down then down through the valley back to Dorchester.\nThe massive ditches and banks of Maiden Castle, stretching across a saddle-backed hilltop 914 metres long, are the end result of many centuries of modification and enlargement during the Iron Age.\nThe first early Iron Age (800–550 BC) hillfort enclosed only the eastern end of the hill, with a single rampart and a V-shaped ditch. The original rampart was probably dumped earth, stone and chalk from the ditch, but a complex timber revetted wall flanked the two entrances.\nIn the middle Iron Age (550–300 BC), a much larger area of 19 hectares was enclosed including the western end of the hill, allowing more people to live within the defences.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Chris for an 9.5-mile (15 km) walk starting in Louth, often referred to as the \"Capital of the Wolds.\" This historic market town provides a great introduction to the surrounding countryside and features the striking spire of St James’ Church—the tallest of any parish church in the UK. For those who fancy a challenge at the start, we’ll climb the 199 steps to the top of the spire (entry £3.50) for panoramic views across the Wolds.\nThe route then passes through Hubbard’s Hills, a wooded valley with a stream and footbridges, before heading out into the Wolds, taking in the rural landscapes around Welton Vale. Here, you’ll spot the Whale Bone Arch—a curious and unexpected landmark with maritime origins, tucked into the landscape as a nod to seafaring history.\nFrom there, we continue through South Elkington, where the 15th-century All Saints Church stands above the village among mature trees, offering views across open countryside. We’ll take a short break at The Shop—a small local spot serving tea, coffee, and ice cream—before making our way back to Louth.\nAfter the walk, we’ll head to the Greyhound Inn for a well-earned drink or bite to eat.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is in\nHorncastle\n, just 13 miles (22 minutes) away.\nLincolnshire Walks 2025\n17/05/25 -\nNettleton Top Day Walk\n- Lincolnshire Wolds\n19/07/25 -\nA stroll on the Viking Way\n- Lincolnshire Wolds\n16/08/25 -\nSpire Views and Whale Bones\n- Lincolnshire Wolds\n17/08/25 -\nTurf Maze & Tideway Trail\n- Northern Lincolnshire\n06/09/25 -\nUp the Hill & Through the Glory Hole\n- Lincoln (live soon!)\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This 11 mile / 18km walk starts in Winster, an old lead mining village - once most prosperous - the main street is all 18th Century and contains several fine buildings, including the Hall (built in 1628) and the 16th Century Market House.\nFrom Winster we stroll downhill for a while before climbing onto Stanton Moor, here we see a total contrast in vegetation - now mainly open heather moor with a scant covering of birch. Stanton Moor, a finger of gritstone amid limestone country, rises to 1,060 feet (323m) and is open, breezy, heather clad moorland giving glorious views across the valley of the Derwent. It's two chief characteristics, are the curious rock formations and the vast number of prehistoric remains - burial chambers, standing stones, circles and fortifications - that litter the moor.\nAfter circumnavigating the moor, our descent takes in the old quarry village of Birchover. We continue from here along a combination of tracks and field paths on the approach to the gritstone tor of Robin Hood`s Stride. Cratcliffe Tor can be found nearby. At its foot, we find the Hermit`s Cave, notable for the 12th Century crucifix carved into the rock.\nMore field paths, a stroll down a quiet lane, then a short, sharp climb, lead us to Elton, an attractive village of stone cottages. We finish off by following the Limestone Way back to Winster.\nWalk Highlights:\nstone circle known as Nine Ladies, Robin Hoods Stride, Winster, Birchover, Elton, Cratcliffe Tor and Hermits Cave.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

There will be live entertainment on the Main Stage, a Cabaret Stage that has numerous local acts and usually some celebrity to headline with going on until about 7.00pm, Pride Market stall, plenty of food and drink vendors and even a fun fair. You can also bring your own food and drink if you want to make a picnic of it. It is a free event, but you can support it by buying a wristband.\nThere are usually a couple of after parties in the town centre and even a club night if you're up to it. (I probably won't stay after about 5.30pm, but I expect it'll be fairly busy in town ).

    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "19",
    "Summary": "Where are we going?\nWe'll be staying in a bunkhouse in the Brecon Beacons, situated in the heart of waterfall country, and very near to the famous caves & waterfalls of Ystradfellte. The waterfalls of Clyngwyn are literally on our doorstep. Sgwd Clun Gwyn waterfall, the first of the falls on the Afon Mellte is only 500m from the farm so a short 5 minute walk away. We are close to the famous Sgwd Yr Eira waterfalls.\nOutside the bunkhouse there is a circular area with large fire pit and eating area (weather permitting) from where there are beautiful views of the Brecon Beacons. There's also a small stone built roofed building seating 6 people with a log burner. So we will have plenty of space both inside and out.\nOn Sunday we need to check out of the bunkhouse by 11am, but there may be the option to then head out for a Sunday walk and /or a pub lunch.\nDuties\nThe event is run by ODL volunteers who will need all participants to share in our domestic duties: food preparation, table setting and clearing, emptying bins, dishwashing, ongoing tidying of our space, cleaning of our dorms and bathrooms before departure.\nBedding\nBedding is provided for you, but don't forget to bring a towel.\nFriday Evening\n: Arrive anytime after 4pm, meet the rest of the group and socialise. Welcome 'meeting' and we'll have the usual Outdoor lads buffet so please bring something that can be shared between two or three people.\nSaturday Day Event\n: After breakfast, we’ll head into the surrounding countryside to explore the Waterfalls.  The route is roughly 10 miles, including at least one point where the path will be walking behind the Sgwd Yr Eira waterfalls.  So, expect to get a bit wet and muddy even in summer.\nWe'll be aiming to reach Pontneddfechan for lunch - possibly enough a time for a pub lunch, this will be confirmed nearer the time.  Be warned that after lunch most of the walking back to the hostel is uphill.  So maybe don't have too big a lunch.\nSaturday Evening\n: Relax, socialise, chillout, chat, boardgames. Dinner is included in the event cost, and if the weather is suitable we'll get the fire pit going outside.\nSunday\n: After breakfast we need to clean up and check out by 11am.\nMeals and Food\nIncluding in the event cost - Saturday and Sunday Breakfast, Saturday Evening Meal\nPlease bring something for the 'Friday Night Buffet' and make plans for Saturday lunchtime (Packed Lunch or plan for a pub lunch) Tea, Coffee and Cake: Will be provided throughout the weekend. Other Drinks and snacks: Please bring your own.\nPlease make sure your food requirements/allergies are updated on your ODL profile as these will be used to inform the shopping list.\nDogs\nare not permitted on this event.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It's a perfect spot for hiking, chilling, and exploring.\nOn Saturday and Sunday we'll probably hike along the coast. Expect plenty of up and downs but also some spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way, with wooded valleys, rocky coves and stunning beaches including Slapton Sands and Blackpool Sands.\nThe spacious campsite was once used as an airfield by American marines to practice for the D-Day landings. Sadly the marines have long gone, but the campsite is in a great spot and we'll have our own field just for us! There's toilets, hot showers (20p for 5 mins), a small kitchen (with fridge) and washing up sinks. Camp fires and BBQs are allowed providing they are off the ground.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on the campsite but will need to be on a lead. Dogs are £1 a night, payable directly to the site on arrival. Well behaved OutdoorLads too please...this isn’t a party event and we'll need to be quiet after 11pm (the owners are super strict about this).\nThere's a couple of pubs a short stroll away and Slapton Sands beach is a further ten minutes down the road.  There’s a clothing optional beach too, if that’s your thing.\nPhotos:\nAll photos from OutdoorLads Members and permission is given for use by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement? Along the way, see some of the South East’s most beautiful countryside, dramatic hills and natural panoramas along the way. Look out for more of these walks around the South East over the coming months.\nThis route definitely plays into the ascent and decent aspect of the challenge, with two thirds of the route either ascending or descending the Watlington SE500 is up there when it comes to calorie burning!\nWe start the walk in the charming town of Watlington which is nestled in the scenic Chiltern Hills. The town boasts a history dating back to the 6th century, with medieval streets and historic buildings creating a unique atmosphere. Watlington Hill is a popular spot for nature enthusiasts, offering stunning views and ideal walking paths. The town has a growing reputation as a creative centre with a lively community of artists and musicians, hosting a range of annual events celebrating the arts, music, TV, and film, including Midsomer Murders, Inspector Morse, Poirot, Great Expectations, Sherlock Holmes, Philomena, and many more. Watlington is one of the few remaining market towns to have its own award-winning butchers, artisan chocolatiers, fresh fruit and vegetable market, florists, and boutique shops. This walk offers beautiful views and a variety of landscapes, including woodlands and open fields. The area is rich in history and natural beauty.\nThe\nroute\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome on this walk, there will be livestock on route.

But you are rewarded with a lot of forest and a sense of being away from it all.\nWe'll start near the River Deben, and pass through beautiful Suffolk countryside before heading into the woods. Miles of pine forest await, as we make our way around the perimeter of an old airbase. We'll stop for lunch in a Forestry England car park where a refreshment van serves drinks and snacks for those who need them. We'll then continue our journey out of the forest, passing Gobblecock Cottage, where the forest opens up to acres of beautiful farmland.\nAs we near the end of the walk we will arrive at Sutton Hoo, the famous site of Anglo-Saxon burial mounds. We will have time to go up the viewing platform to take in the full view (all for free) but we will skip the visitor centre. We will then finish off with a final woodland walk back to where we began.\nThe day promises to deliver lovely settings, great company and tired legs! There may be an opportunity for a drink at the end of the walk for those who want to.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but they'll need to be fit and able to cope with 14 miles in their stride. Please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n).  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nDon't waste that space\nBear in mind that both new and existing members are excited to be getting out more.

    "Summary": "One of our favourite events of the year - we cannot wait for our return to the Peak District for BIG Peaky Weekender!\nThere are three accommodation options for this event:\nHostel\nCamping\nTeepee (camping add-on)\nThis weekend is a celebration of all things outdoors. This outdoor centre is quickly becoming an OutdoorLads favourite, perfectly located in the heart of the Peak District for walking, cycling, mountain biking, climbing, and paddlesports - it's just so ace in so many ways!\nIn terms of evening entertainment, this event will be a relaxed affair, designed for chatting to others and being sociable rather than dancing the night away. We'll have our bar-in-a-teepee again of course, but rather than a late night disco, it's more about having a space to chat, catch up with old and new friends, and maybe even play a few games!\nOutdoorLads will have exclusive use of the site, designed for large groups like ours. You can be sure that everybody you meet over the weekend will be an OutdoorLad or a member of staff at the venue.\nYou can do as much or as little as you desire over the weekend (but we do advise you to get stuck in!).\nEvents\nOur events are now available to book onto; here's the current full programme.\nAny leaders wishing to add to this list, please get in touch with the office - always room for more events!\nSaturday\n08:00\nBakewell parkrun\n09:15\n1000m Peaks of Monsal Monster Challenge\n09:30\nCaving & High Ropes Course\n09:30\nAbsail, Cargo Nets & High Ropes Activity Day\n09:45\nStanage Edge Circular from Grindleford\n10:20\nKayaking\n10:30\nLeisure Cycle and Brewery\n10:30\nQueens of the Bakewell Tart\n10:30\nOutdoor Trad Climbing, beginners welcome\n10:45\nAll aboard to Cheedale\nNEW!\n10:45\nMonsal, Magpie and Meander\n11:00\nChatsworth House and Gardens\n11:30\nThornbridge Brewery via the Monsal Trail\n12:20\nStand Up Paddleboarding\n12:20\nKayaking - afternoon\nNEW!\n18:30\nStanding Yoga\n20:00\nEvening Board Games\nSunday\n11:30\nThornbridge Hall Tour\n12:30\nSunday Lunch at Hassop Cafe\nAll meeting points are in the sheltered area near the large yurt / bar, where you will also sign in to the event.\nFood\nContinental breakfasts, packed lunches and cooked evening meals are available to pre-order! It is important to pre-order, as there will be very few extras available to purchase over the weekend. If pre-ordering food, make sure the dietary preferences on your OutdoorLads account are correct.\nThe canteen is in the building closest to the teepees. We'll also put meals on sale nearer the time, but Friday is likely to be jacket potatoes and a range of fillings, and a hot cooked option, including veggie and vegan alternatives, on Saturday.\nThose camping are obviously welcome to cater for themselves by their tent, but will not have use of the hostel kitchens and dining areas. Please ensure that any BBQ's are raised off the grass.\nThose staying in a hostel will have access to a shared kitchen and dining area, but please ensure you leave the area\nspotless\nafter use. This means\nwashing\n,\ndrying\nand\nputting back\nanything you use, wiping down the counter tops and microwave, and disposing of waste correctly.

    "Summary": "One of our favourite events of the year - we cannot wait for our return to the Peak District for BIG Peaky Weekender!\nThere are three accommodation options for this event:\nHostel\nCamping\nTeepee (camping add-on)\nThis weekend is a celebration of all things outdoors. This outdoor centre is quickly becoming an OutdoorLads favourite, perfectly located in the heart of the Peak District for walking, cycling, mountain biking, climbing, and paddlesports - it's just so ace in so many ways!\nIn terms of evening entertainment, this event will be a relaxed affair, designed for chatting to others and being sociable rather than dancing the night away. We'll have our bar-in-a-teepee again of course, but rather than a late night disco, it's more about having a space to chat, catch up with old and new friends, and maybe even play a few games!\nOutdoorLads will have exclusive use of the site, designed for large groups like ours. You can be sure that everybody you meet over the weekend will be an OutdoorLad or a member of staff at the venue.\nYou can do as much or as little as you desire over the weekend (but we do advise you to get stuck in!).\nEvents\nOur events are now available to book onto; here's the current full programme.\nAny leaders wishing to add to this list, please get in touch with the office - always room for more events!\nSaturday\n08:00\nBakewell parkrun\n09:15\n1000m Peaks of Monsal Monster Challenge\n09:30\nCaving & High Ropes Course\n09:30\nAbsail, Cargo Nets & High Ropes Activity Day\n09:45\nStanage Edge Circular from Grindleford\n10:20\nKayaking\n10:30\nLeisure Cycle and Brewery\n10:30\nQueens of the Bakewell Tart\n10:30\nOutdoor Trad Climbing, beginners welcome\n10:45\nAll aboard to Cheedale\nNEW!\n10:45\nMonsal, Magpie and Meander\n11:00\nChatsworth House and Gardens\n11:30\nThornbridge Brewery via the Monsal Trail\n12:20\nStand Up Paddleboarding\n12:20\nKayaking - afternoon\nNEW!\n18:30\nStanding Yoga\n20:00\nEvening Board Games\nSunday\n11:30\nThornbridge Hall Tour\n12:30\nSunday Lunch at Hassop Cafe\nAll meeting points are in the sheltered area near the large yurt / bar, where you will also sign in to the event.\nFood\nContinental breakfasts, packed lunches and cooked evening meals are available to pre-order! It is important to pre-order, as there will be very few extras available to purchase over the weekend. If pre-ordering food, make sure the dietary preferences on your OutdoorLads account are correct.\nThe canteen is in the building closest to the teepees. We'll also put meals on sale nearer the time, but Friday is likely to be jacket potatoes and a range of fillings, and a hot cooked option, including veggie and vegan alternatives, on Saturday.\nThose camping are obviously welcome to cater for themselves by their tent, but will not have use of the hostel kitchens and dining areas. Please ensure that any BBQ's are raised off the grass.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs, they are not allowed on site.\nCampervans, caravans, motorhomes:\nDue to the venues restrictions, we are unable to accept campervans, caravans and motorhomes.\nImages:\nAerial shots kindly supplied by and used with permission from Will Allaway.

    "Summary": "We’ll make our way through shaded woodland walks (the trees will be in leaf!), alongside rivers to open moorland.\nStarting in Yelverton I’ll take you south, briefly picking up the route of the old Plymouth/Dartmoor tramway, before heading into the Meavy valley. Continuing mainly through woodland alongside the disused Plymouth/Tavistock GWR railway downstream to Hoo Meavy, passing old copper mines, signs of charcoaling platforms and long abandoned head weirs for leats to provide water power to distant mines.\nFrom Lower Goodameavy we’ll ascend an outstanding example of an inclined plane (what’s left of it), pass the disused Dewerstone granite quarries, located in lovely temperate rainforest, before continuing to rise out of the woodland to summit Dewerstone Rock itself.\nAn open moor walk of a mile or so, offering views of the south west Dartmoor tors and no doubt an encounter with some of the Dartmoor ponies, brings us to Cadover Bridge. Lunch (maybe a paddle in the river) before we set off again following the River Plym back through woodland along the line of the old china clay slurry pipeline from Lee Moor. Passing the old workings of the Shaugh Prior clay drying kilns, we’ll drop down to the confluence of the rivers where there is yet more industrial heritage.\nA short upward walk along a back-road brings us out onto the open moorland of Roborough Common with views back to the Dewerstone and across the local farmland. Now a relatively level walk across the Common brings us to Drake’s Leat and thence (perhaps after an optional call into the Skylark Inn at Clearbrook) to the Dartmoor/Plymouth tramway. From there a flat walk takes us back to Yelverton.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nPlease also be aware of the\nrules and guidance from the Dartmoor National Park Authority\non visiting the moor with your dog\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",

    "Summary": "When I checked out the area on a cold, bleak day in February, Chilling lived up to its name. When we stroll round the area on a lazy, hazy day in July, 'Chilling' will suggest relaxation. The only settlemen is Titchfield, far from bleak, which grew in prosperity in Georgian times as that of its Abbey dwindled, leaving the Earl of Southampton's ex-monastic mansion to be plundered for its stone. And on matters geological, the landscape is formed of Ice Age gravel outwash overlying sand, and this makes for a flat terrain which the sea and River Meon have quickly eroded. The Meon's mouth is a tiny, pretty harbour with a café, an ice cream van and a beach where we can have our lunch and a swim.\nThe sights:\nTitchfield Abbey:\nFounded in 1232 by Prémontré Abbey in France, the 'White Canons' lived a communal life observing monastic vows, farming the land, caring for the sick and preaching. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537, Henry VIII granted the abbey to his Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. The wealth of his new domain aided Wriothesley's ascent as a courtier, and he transformed the abbey into a handsome home. Wriothesley’s grandson Henry, 3rd Earl of Southampton, was a patron of Shakespeare, some of whose plays were premiered here. On the death of the 4th Earl, the abbey passed through several families, until 1781, when most of the building was demolished for building stone, leaving the gatehouse intact. It is free to enter. Nearby is Titchfield Great Barn, 48m long, in which the timbers have been dated to 1370.\nSt Peter's Church, Titchfield:\nEstablished 680, making it one of the oldest used churches in England. Though only a few parts of the original structure survive, the church contains a mixture of building styles. There is a sumptuous tomb to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, his son Henry, and grandson Henry, the patron of Shakespeare.\nTitchfield:\nLong a centre for business, with the town once having a small port. There were also tanneries, a market (in a fine market square), a fair, breweries, and craft workshops. A market hall was built in the Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early C17, but in 1970 it was bought, in a derelict state, by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. Titchfield is quite a gracious place.\nChilling and Brownwich Cliffs:\nPleistocene deposits (2.5 to 1 million years old) of gravel washed out from glaciers to the north overlies Eocene (50-40 million years old) sands and clays giving a flat relief to the area. These are unconsolidated rocks, easily eroded by the sea and rivers. The profile of the cliffs with gravel atop sand is obvious, with some disturbance of the gravel by ice wedges developing under periglacial conditions, a process called cryoturbation. Some erratics (rocks deposited by melting ice bergs) dot the beach, which are sarsen stones composed of sandstone, probably from Salisbury Plain.\nTitchfield Haven:\nThe estuary of the River Meon. The 'Visit Hampshire' website states: 'Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve is a wetland nature reserve with a rich habitat of rivers, marshlands and scrapes. It is excellent for birdwatching and attracts many people hoping to spot a rare species. From any of the eight easy-to-access viewing hides visitors can see all kinds of wildlife such as deer, foxes and wetland plants.' We will walk around the edge of the reserve, not entering it as a fee is charged, and still see many of these habitats. There is a shop, café and exhibition centre and nearby a small beach. The mouth of the Meon is controlled by lock gates and a small, pretty harbour has been created.\nTitchfield Canal:\nPossibly the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611. Close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. It was used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated although for a while Titchfield was a small inland port.\nSeawater quality:\nThe most recent bathing water quality at the bathing location was rated 'Excellent'. The water quality has always been deemed 'Good' or 'Excellent', but check\nhere\n(Environment Agency) or\nhere\n(Surfers Against Sewage).\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. Dogs are permitted on Hill Head Beach which is where we'll have lunch and a swim. Drawbacks of the walk for dogs include some roads to walk along and cross which may be busy, and summer heat which could be exhausting for them. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll go north up Mill Lane to see the abbey, then head back, using a footpath behind the recreation ground and crossing the A27 to enter Titchfield by an alleyway. We'll walk through the centre of Titchfield to Bellfield, then walk south along the canal to Great Posbrook Farm, where we'll go west along footpaths to Brownwich Lane, which will take us north to Warsash Road. After a little way walking west along this we'll reach Hook Lane and cross fields to reach the coast. At Brownwich Pond, we'll walk south to the cliff top and walk along the cliffs, using The Solent Way, to Hill Head Harbour. After lunch and swim, we'll go back and use the footpath that runs between the nature reserve and the canal all the way back to Titchfield where we'll use back streets to take us to the A27 and the car park.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Please note the date change from 7 June to 9 August.\nJoin me on this spectacular circular walk from Lewes around the South Downs. After a steepish climb near the start, the walk offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and beyond.\nWhen I led this walk in 2023, it was a very hot day, and the majority of us ran out of water. Fortunately we found a water tap in a local church yard. Hopefully it will be cooler this time, but do remember your water!\nWhat is SE500 Challenge?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nPlaces\nof interest\nLewes\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nSouth\nDowns\nNational\nPark\nThis is England's newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010, covering an area of 1,627 square kilometres (628 sq miles) and stretches for 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.\nOffham\nPronounced \"Oaf-um\", the \"new\" St. Peter's Church was built to replace the Church of Old St. Peter in 1840s. Offham hosts two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Clayton to Offham Escarpment and Offham Marshes.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\nWe leave delightful Lewes and pass over the railway line and A27 to pick up Jugg's Road (track) which we follow past the windmill at Kingston Hollow. With a steepish climb of 197m, we're graced with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the South Downs. After passing under the railway and over the A27 again, we climb Long Hill, where we'll stop for lunch, enjoying views of the surrounding countryside. We'll continue over Balmer Down and along the South Downs Way, before starting our gradual descent to the village of Offham. The walk then follows the River Ouse, and the outskirts of Lewes, climbing towards the castle before descending past The Fifteenth Century Bookshop and the quaint houses along Keere Street, and back to the station.\nPlease join me if you wish, for a drink at The Depot, next to the station.\nPlease note, the walk does not allow time to visit Lewes Castle.\nDogs\n:\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and be prepared for a couple of stiles/hills on the walk. Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nIMPORTANT\n! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington.

An alternative is to bypass the section on a quieter and less-trafficked, but still steep (down) in places country lane.  We can decide on the day what we'd prefer.\nPateley Bridge is the perfect place to stop for a cream tea, and to refuel for the next climb. It's also the home of the\nOldest Sweet Shop in the World\n- super sour fizz balls, anyone?  The road out of town leads to\nBrimham Rocks\n, a National Trust-owned property with weird and wonderful rock formations we may briefly cycle through.\n8km further on we cycle through the grounds of the stunning\nFountains Abbey\nWorld Heritage Site - a stunning assembly of history: the ruined Cistercian abbey, the landscape gardens, the medieval deer park before reaching\nRipon\n, where we'll stop for lunch. (A 10km shorter route bypasses Fountains Abbey and Ripon, with lunch in Bishop Monkton instead - we'll decide before we set off which route to take).\nAfter lunch the Way of the Roses meanders down the Ouse River valley, along quiet country lanes before crossing the Ouse on the rickety Aldwark Toll Bridge, which is free for cyclists.  The route is almost entirely flat between Ripon and York, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n98km (61 miles) with 890m (2,919ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(Shorter route on\nCycle.Travel here\n).\n**\nYou will need to book your own accommodation in York, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in York.  Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn City Centre (Layerthorpe).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL; Image 6: Aldwark Toll Bridge\n© Andrew Whale and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; all other images Pixabay Public Domain.",

CatZero is also the name of the charity that own and operate the vessel.\nOn this voyage, you will be crewing the boat under the instruction and direction of the fantastic CatZero team. Absolute beginner with no sailing experience, or total sailing pro? It doesn't matter if you've never set foot on a boat before or if you're a qualified sailor, these trips are for everyone. You'll learn what you need to know to sail the ship.\nThis is not a leisure holiday! Voyages aboard CatZero are interactive, fun and rewarding. You'll be living in very close proximity with the rest of team, and working together throughout the five days. There will be long days and maybe nights! You'll take your role in helping run the boat, from cooking, cleaning, scrubbing the decks and helping sail throughout your trip. Team work and camaraderie will be in abundance, and we're sure you'll have an absolutely fantastic time on board. You'll be exhausted by the end of the week, but you will have had the absolute time of your lives, learn a lot about sailing, yourself, and each other - this is the kind of trip that creates special memories.\nPast sailing experience is not necessary - there will be an experienced crew on board who will show you everything you need to do. If you've never sailed before but think you'd enjoy it, and are prepared to get stuck in and give it your all for a five days, then this is a perfect event for you!
