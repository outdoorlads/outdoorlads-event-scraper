Steeped in legends, magic and mystery Glastonbury Tor is the centerpiece of King Arthur’s realm and the heart of Avalon. Wells Cathedral and Wookey Hole Caves are nearby and there’s some great country walks to be had, so we won’t be short of things to do.\nWe’ll be staying in nearby Street – once occupied by the Romans Street is 2 miles south-west of Glastonbury and home to the Clarks Outlet Shopping village if you fancy a bit of bargain hunting too!\nAccommodation:\nOpened in 1931, YHA Street is the oldest YHA hostel still in operation today. It’s a quirky and compact Swiss-style chalet that’s surrounded by National Trust land and has recently been refurbished, with major improvements to all the communal areas, bedrooms and washing facilities, and has central heating.\nItinerary\nFriday Evening:\nArrive, meet others and socialise, we’ll have the usual Outdoor lads buffet, and possibly an evening activity followed by the welcome meeting.\nSaturday Day:\nAfter breakfast (which is included in the event cost), we’ll head out to visit Glastonbury, climb the tor, and relax at the\nWhite Spring Sanctuary\n.  We'll aim for lunch in Glastonbury itself, so there should be options for sandwiches there.\nSaturday Evening:\nDinner is included in the event cost, after which we may have an activity to join in if you wish.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast (included in the event cost) you are either free to go home or join in a possible activity such as a visit to the Wells Cathedral, and maybe end up at a local pub for a Sunday roast before heading home.\nDogs:\nSorry but the event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check out the South Wales and South West Calendar\nhere\n.",

    "Summary": "A fantabulosa troll round town to vada the latties, boozers and boards where birthday boy Kenneth Williams minced, mused and moued (that's your actual French). Putting our best plates forward, we'll go round the Old Smoke to clock the pads he called home, and the places where he lapped up the dolly trade and the odd bevvy. You'll have to nish the chat while I do the palari at each place, so keep your minces peeled as we charper how the Smoke shaped him being bona ajax on the surface, but in a right two-and-eight deep down. So let's zhoosh up our riahs, put on some comfy bats, and stretch our lallies, because this mince will be fabulosa, and dead bona for a gaggle of fortuni omis like us.\nThe vadas and\ntroll\n(please click the link at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\n1. Russell Square Station:\nBorn on 22 February 1926 in Bingfield Street in King's Cross (now demolished), Bloomsbury was the spiritual home of Kenneth Williams. 'They needn’t talk to me about loneliness. I’ve walked too many miles of pavement…' (\nThe Kenneth Williams Diaries,\n21 April 1964)\n2. 57 Marchmont Street, Bloomsbury:\nChildhood home from 1935-1956. Mid-19th century terrace. “I never felt completely happy here, yet it shaped every odd, twisted impulse I have.” (\nTKWD,\n21 Apr 1964). His father ran a barber's shop on the ground floor. 'I remember once a man came into the shop and said \"I'd like a blow wave, please\" to which my father replied \"you'll get no blow wave 'ere. What are you? An iron? Iron hoof? Not 'avin' any irons in my shop. Go on, get out!\" (\nKenneth Williams, Comic Roots\n, 1983)\n3. 14 Cromer House, Cromer Street, St Pancras:\nLate Victorian block, 1880s. Grew up here with parents and sister (1925-1935). \"When I was very young I used to throw a flower pots [from the balconies] on the heads of unsuspecting passersby, and one of them was Florrie Plume who happened to be a great friend of my mother's. She said afterwards “it was the only by wearing a thick felt 'at at the time that saved me from a terrible injury from your boy”. My missile throwing was not the result of wickedness; it was simply because I suffered from insomnia and frankly I still do.' (\nKenneth Williams: Going Places\n, 1975)\n4. The Boot Pub, Cromer Street:\nLate Georgian pub, 1820s. Early comic training ground doing comic songs and routines and listening to the stories and accents of patrons. 'I found that if I got up on the stage to entertain the troops I could make them shut up and look.' (Quote c. 1960s).\n5. Argyle Primary School, Tonbridge Street:\nVictorian school, 1870s. Early education and first stage notice. “As a scholar my results were lamentable except for English because I liked the English master. He would take out take us reading poetry every day - Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning - and he directed me in the school play...it was called the Rose and the Ring, and they gave me a big part as the Princess Angelica. I stomped around the stage waving my feather duster and saying \"get out of my way!\". I had no idea how aristocrats behaved, but I think I did it instinctively. I got a very good notice in the local paper which pleased me immensely. It was my first taste of performing. It read: \"Kenneth Williams, with his mincing step and comical demeanour as the Princess Angelia was a firm favourite for the audience to whom his pert vivacity made great appeal.\"' (\nKenneth Williams, Comic Roots\n, 1983)\n6. Endsleigh Court:\nA mid-20th century Bloomsbury mansion block. His first independent home (1956–59).\n7. Marlborough House, Osnaburgh Street:\n19th-century townhouse (demolished). Lived here from 1970 until his death on 14 April 1988. 'Providing there is no pain I shall be happy to go when the time comes; nothing here has really delighted me except Art.' (\nTKWD,\n22 January 1985)\n8. Regent’s Park – Outer Circle / Queen Mary’s Gardens:\nJohn Nash, 1811–1820. 'I walked here often, alone with my thoughts. The roses seemed to judge me gently, not mock me.'  (\nTKWD\n, 20 March 1988)\n9. Farley Court, Baker Street\nEdwardian block, 1905. Lived here from 1963 to 1970. “I sometimes wonder where I learned all the rubbish ‘beliefs’ I used to hold… the only way to execute & convey your vision… is to do it yourself.' (\nTKWD\n). Nearby is Madame Tussaud's and the Planetarium (1958).\n10. BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place:\nArt Deco building by George Val Myer, 1932. It was here that some of his greatest radio successes -\nBeyond Our Ken\n,\nRound the Horne\n,\nJust a Minute\n- were recorded. 'They needn’t talk to me about loneliness. I’ve walked too many miles of pavement…' (\nTKWD,\n21 April 1964). Nearby is all Souls Church (John Nash, 1823) and the RIBA headquarters (George Grey Wornum, 1934).\n11. Garrick Theatre, Charing Cross Road:\nDesigned by W.G.R. Sprague, 1889. Location of revues, such as\nPieces of Eight\nand\nShare My Lettuce\n.  'Last performance of\nShare My Lettuce\n… a wonderful last night house.' (\nTKWD,\n17 May 1958)\n12. Stanfords, Long Acre (Site):\n19th-century building, rebuilt 1920s. Early draughtsman job as a mapmaker. 'The thing to do, in any circumstance, is to appear to know exactly what you are doing.' (\nTKWD,\nc1964)\n13. Russell Square:\n1804, Laid out by the Dukes of Bedford. 'Squares of learning and quiet; I envied the calmness of stone as I carried my restless mind past.'

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for a day of INDOOR BOULDERING at RockCity in Hull.\nIf you haven't been to RockCity before, please head to\ntheir website\nto complete the membership form and purchase a Peak Day Pass before coming to the centre.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nDon't forget to join us in the evening for the\nHull Social\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.",

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nStart the new year with a refreshing adventure with a bracing (or wet!) figure of eight 11-mile winter hike from Reading Station, into my local 'hood' and reaching out into the fringes of the Chiltern countryside. With the days still short and the air crisp (or moist!), this is a good way to shake off the post-holiday slump and reconnect with nature — and each other.\nThe Route:\nWe’ll quickly leave the bustle of Reading's town centre behind, finding the Thames Path, using the millennial pedestrian Christchurch bridge to cross over into Caversham and continue along the river through the Christchurch Meadows. After a busy road junction we escape into quiet suburbia starting with a quick stop at Caversham court and then through Caversham Heights, home of yours truly, and if there are any fans of Coronation Street please let me know and I can point something out!!\nFrom Caversham Heights we continue North and West across the South Oxfordshire and Chiltern Hills boundaries, largely walking through the Mapledurham estate which includes a golf course, farm and parkland. We will get a view of the front of Mapledurham House as we proceed towards the village of Mapledurham, where we will stop for lunch by the churchyard and you can also get a glimpse of Mapledurham water mill.\nAs this can be a muddy time of the year this walk optimizes on tarmac and concrete lanes, but still with some brief dirt sections which are likely to be muddy. Towards the end of the walk, as we return back to Caversham and Reading, there are several options to have a beer or coffee/tea and cake and we can figure out what the group would like to do on the day.\nThe route can be found\nhere\n:\nDogs:\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are minimal stiles on route but are a few sections where we will be walking in parks and urban areas where they will need to be on a lead. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nThe Sights:\nReading:\nwe won't see a lot of Reading on this walk, but with a population larger than many cities it's now the largest town in the UK. On the gaydar it has associations with Oscar Wilde who went to prison in Reading Jail (hence the poem Ballad of Reading Gaol), the victorian walls of which are now adorned with a Banksy. Reading Station is one of the busiest outside of London and was heavily re-built in 2015, and became a terminus of the Elizabeth Line when this opened in 2022. The swanky new development opposite the station is called Station Hill (only phase 1 is currently complete) and made headline news in 2023 when there was a big fire in one of the towers whilst still under construction.\nChristchurch Meadows:\nis a large public park in situated on the north bank of the River Thames, opposite the town centre, and features wide grassy areas, mature trees and a Riverside path.\nCaversham:\nis Reading suburb, located just north of the Thames, and has a distinct village-like atmosphere with a busy high street offering independent shops, cafés, and restaurants, along with several parks and riverside walks. In years gone by it would have been part of Oxfordshire and separate to Reading in Berkshire, as with some towns and villages along the Thames the river acts as the county boundary.\nCaversham Court Gardens:\nis a historic public garden. Set on the site of a former medieval manor house, the grade II gardens feature landscaped lawns, mature trees, riverside walks and the remains of old terraces and walls.\nMapledurham:\nis a large parish adjoining Caversham, with the main village itself being a few miles into the countryside and feels a million miles away the bustle of Reading, being practically traffic free at the end of a no-through road. It is primarily an estate village with all of the houses formerly linked to the estate. It’s best known for its historic\nMapledurham House\n, an Elizabethan manor, built in 1585, and the home of the Blount family for 400 years and is still privately owned by their descendants. The house has featured in T\nhe Eagle Has Landed\n(1976) and\nMidsomer Murders\n.  Adjacent to the house and also part of the estate is\nMapledurham Watermill\n, the last operational watermill on the Thames, which still produces flour today. For music fans, the mill appeared on the front cover of Black Sabbath's debut album in 1970.\nUnfortunately neither the house or watermill are open to the public in the winter, but if you are inspired to return they are open during the summer months.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nAll photos taken by the leader and permission given to OutdoorLads for use.",

Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nIf the event is full, please join the waiting list. If other leaders are able to attend, I may be able to increase numbers.\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event. Spaces for beginners are limited & 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing (or would like a refresher), there are plenty of top-rope routes to choose from after learning the essential climbing & safety techniques with one of our friendly, experienced climbing leaders.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "A Valentine's Day hike to get your heart racing!\nThis hike will start and finish in Arundel. There will be a good mix of scenery and views across the Sussex countryside. A few reasonable ups and downs and also pleasant flat ground await us as we enjoy some history and landmarks.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nRiver Arun\nOne of the fastest flowing rivers in England this river will accompany us for most of the hike. It is the longest river in Sussex and is tidal some 25 miles inland from Littlehampton. It's safe to assume that many of the villages and hamlets we pass through chose their location due to the river. Major improvements were made to the river as far back as 1540 when Arundel became a port.\nArun Valley Railway Line\nA much loved railway route offering great views of the Sussex countryside. As with the river the railway line will be with us for the hike. This route was one of the last in the area to be upgraded to modern colour light signalling, having previously been controlled by semaphore signals. The route also now uses axile counters to monitor the passage of trains. It sounds primitive but is meant to be fail safe. It works by train wheels being counted into a section of track and then counted out as it leaves. As long as they match then it's safe for the train behind to move forward.\nBurpham Church\nA church was recorded as being here in the Domesday book. The current tower dates to around the 15th century. We should hear the bells as they ring out every 15 minutes. There are records of bells being installed as early as 1488 when the vicar gave 12p towards purchasing them.\nNorth Stoke\nA medieval village first recorded in 1086. A sparce population meant that in 1931 the parish was merged with neighbouring Amberley. A few houses remain and a church that is maintained by volunteers.\nSouth Stoke\nThis village now falls under the Parish of Houghton but is part of the wider area of Offham. The Domesday book listed South Stoke as having 14 households and a church valued at £4. The population declined to medieval levels in 1806. This was due to common land being enclosed for Arundel Park. This in turn took away places for the local population to graze sheep and livestock.\nThe Black Rabbit\nOn our return leg we'll stop at this lovely pub for a break. It's a renowned location offering views of Arundel Castle, the river and the wetlands beyond. Inside the pub boasts authentic props from the Harry Potter movies.\nArundel Castle\nAlthough not part of this hike we will have views of the castle. It is a stunning restored medieval castle that is steeped in history. A couple of highlights include the castle being besieged by troops loyal to Henry I in 1101 and extensive damage being caused during the English Civil War.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can attend.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me if you have any questions.\nLooking For More:\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of other walks taking place in the South East.\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of provisional upcoming events in the ODL diary.\n(All photos taken by the leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads at Nottingham Climbing Centre\nClimbing evenings are held regularly and we tend to go to the local pub – The Lion for refreshments and a social gathering afterwards where they have a wide variety of beverages both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices. We ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive)\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n-     Hire a harness (again, if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n-     Hire shoes and harness - £6.00*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Ben for a quiet and relaxed weekend on the North Devon Coast.\nThis early year weekend is the perfect chance to get some fresh sea air in peaceful countryside.  OutdoorLads hostels are a great way to quickly meet new friends and find out about what we do. Attending your first hostel event could be a daunting experience if you don’t know what’s going to happen so why not have a read of our '\nMy First Hostel Event\n' guide.\nYenworthy is a fully accessible hostel hidden away in a wooded valley on the outskirts of Exmoor making for a warm and comfortable retreat from the depths of Winter.  With three rooms to socialise in along with an undercover area outside and a fire pit area there's plenty of space to play board games or chat away and make new friends aswell as catching up with old ones over the weekend.\nNUT FREE SiTE\n- Our hostel provider has asked that\nno nuts\nare to be brought onto the site.\nFriday evening:\nArrive, settle in and meet with fellow ODLers.  A simple evening meal (included in the event cost) will be provided followed by a welcome meeting.  The rest of the evening is yours to enjoy.\nSaturday:\nAfter breakfast (included in the event cost) we'll head out for an 8 mile walk taking in the South West Coast Path. You will need a relatively good level of fitness for the walk.\nPlease bring a packed lunch\nand maybe a flask of hot drink if it's cold.\nIf you don't fancy coming on the walk, you can choose to stay in the hostel or explore nearby Lynton and Porlock Weir.\nSaturday evening:\nRelax and socialise or help out preparing the 2 course evening meal (included in the event cost) which we'll all enjoy.\nSunday\nAfter breakfast we'll help clean and tidy away leaving the hostel as we found it.  After that you can explore the North Devon Coast.\nACCESIBILITY:\nAs mentioned this hostel is accessible to wheelchair users, with a hoist system available in some rooms and we have the ability to make additional arrangements to support a carer attending if needed.  This means that whilst our walk along the coastal path might not be suitable, we would love to offer the opportunity to attend to someone that might not normally be able to join Outdoorlads events.  If this is you please reach out to\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nso we can ensure we can cater to all of your needs.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "The Climbing Academy is one of the best bouldering centres in the South West. With over 200 problems in a 750 square metre area there is enough to keep even the avid of boulderers occupied.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' as they are referred to tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. For this reason, it is often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nTo come along, you will need to register via the event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive. For entry fee prices go to:\nhttps://www.theclimbingacademy.com/prices/\n.

Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.

    "Summary": "The Climbing Academy is one of the best bouldering centres in the South West. With over 200 problems in a 750 square metre area there is enough to keep even the avid of boulderers occupied.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' as they are referred to tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. For this reason, it is often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nTo come along, you will need to register via the event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.

    "Summary": "BIG20 events are our programme to celebrate our 20th birthday year\n- showcasing some of the best and most loved locations and venues we've been to in the last 20 years! Come along and on our return trip to one of OutdoorLads' favourite bunkhouses in a remote part of Northumberland for THREE nights, this will be a get away from it all weekend. This is a Friday to Monday trip!\nOur venue is located 4 miles from the nearest public road, deep into the Cheviots, along the College Valley. It lies less than 1/2 mile from the Scottish border, sandwiched between the border ridge and the Cheviot (815m).\nIt is surrounded by beautifully rounded Northumberland Hills, close to the northern end of the Pennine Way, with deep, wild valleys, and dramatic gullies created at the end of the last ice age.\nThis will be a remote, away-from-it-all weekend, where phone signals and wi-fi are unlikely, which is a magical chance to connect with OutdoorLads pals and the spectacular scenery that surrounds us. We'll spend two days getting out and exploring on foot - walks are necessarily going to involve some steep climbs and there are no \"gentle\" options - but you'll be rewarded for your efforts with spectacular views!\nThe evenings will be filled with hearty, home-cooked meals, and socialising with fellow OutdoorLads - board games and star gazing are likely to be high on the list of evening entertainment. It will be a fantastic weekend of comradery, great food, and genuinely getting out more!\nThe Hills\nThe\nCheviot Hills\nare a range of rolling hills straddling the Scottish Border with Northumberland. The English section is within the Northumberland National Park. The range includes The Cheviot (the highest hill), plus Hedgehope Hill, Windy Gyle, Cushat Law and Bloodybush Edge.\nThe hills are sometimes considered a part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland as they adjoin the uplands to the north. Since the Pennine Way runs through the region, the hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the Northumberland National Park.\nSome of the gems are in between the hills.\nHen Hole\nis one such place and it makes a wonderful route to the top of the Cheviot from the Hostel. It was created at the end of the last ice age, by meltwater, creating a deep gully with waterfalls, leading up to an amazing basin underneath the Cheviot summit. With some very easy scrambles, it makes a fantastic route to highest point in this whole range of hills.\nWildlife in the College Valley (not that we're guaranteed to see it all!)\nThe valley is well known for its population of\nferal goats\nand is home to around 150. Rumour has it that they were released in medieval times by the monks on Holy Island. This primitive British breed would have died out completely if they hadn't escaped into the wild. As farming changed there was a swing to foreign breeds which produced more milk. The goats can often be seen on the Newton Tors along the eastern side of the Valley. However they can pop up in the most unexpected of places! Over the years many goats have been re-homed to help manage environments elsewhere in the UK and this has helped to ease the pressure on local vegetation.\nRoe deer\nare present throughout the valley. Whilst they are beautiful they also bring their own challenges with damage to trees so their numbers are carefully managed.\nThe valley has a healthy population of\nred squirrels\n. Hazelnuts are a great source of proteins for the squirrels. With care and quiet you could be lucky and see one of these lovely little mammals.\nAdders\n, Britain's only venomous reptile are also present in the valley.\nSlow worms\n, which are really burrowing limbless lizards (commonly mistaken for snakes) are also common. They have been granted protected status along with all other native British reptiles.\nOtters\nare present along the College and Lambden burns.\nThere is a good population of\nrabbits\n,\nhares\n,\nvoles\n,\nfox\n,\nstoat\nand\nweasels\n. These can be seen throughout the valley.\nCollege Valley Estate has spent a lot of time and effort reintroducing\nblack grouse\n, a marvellous bird at risk of imminent extinction in the UK. Black grouse UK, part of the UK Biodiversity plan, is dedicated to reversing this trend towards extinction. In 1995 the Wilderness above Mounthooly was planted with over 55000 broadleaves. This became the largest new native woodland in England. Black grouse were initially quite successful but bad weather has affected recent breeding seasons and numbers have declined.\nThere is a healthy and well managed population of\nred grouse\non all the heather areas in the valley; shooting for these remarkable birds provides a significant income for the estate. The sound of them telling one to 'go-back, go-back, go-back' is one of the sounds of wilderness areas.\nDogs\n. This event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos.\nAll photos taken by Rob Mitchell, OutdoorLads and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join me for a winter walk around historic Stafford, including a visit to the castle where there will be time to freely explore the visitor centre and site. For those who would like to join some of our local ODL members for refreshment after the walk, we will be meeting at the Sun Inn which serves a variety of snacks and meals.\nStafford was founded in 913 by Aethelflaed, Lady of the Mercians. As well as being the administrative centre and county town of Staffordshire, it gained prominence through the Middle Ages as an important market town and later as an industrial centre with key industries being shoemaking, engineering and electrical industry.\nThe Ancient High House is believed to be the largest timber-framed town house in England and was built in 1595 for John Dorrington. After falling into disrepair in the 20th century, it was spared from demolition and saw extensive restoration between 1976-86.\nStafford Castle was built by the Normans on a hilltop to the west of the town in around 1090. Initially made of wood, it was later rebuilt of stone and has been rebuilt twice since. The latest gothic revival dates from the early 19th century and was built atop the earthworks and incorporates much of the original stonework. The final caretakers of the castle moved out in the winter of 1949 as the towers became structurally unsafe. The site was given over to the local authority in 1961 by Lord Stafford and, following works to make the castle remains safe as well as extensive professional excavations the site was opened to the public in 1988.\nThere is free year-round access to the castle site and we should also be able to access the on-site museum and enter the courtyard. There will be around 90 minutes to explore the castle at your own speed before we walk back into town.\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website. If you have any questions then feel free to message the leader if you have any questions.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nImage credits:\nAll pictures have been taken by the walk leader and permission is given to ODL for their use.",

The walk then joins the Calderdale Way where it can be steeper and windy in places, until we reach Stoodley Pike. There are some steps to go up the ‘Pike’ (but it can be very gusty up there so hold on to your hats!). We’ll then make our descent back to Hebden Bridge by walking along Dick’s Lane to Crow’s Nest Wood.\nAfterwards, for those that want to, there's the option of a drink in one of the local pubs or cafes.\nPlan for cold and wet weather!\nSlightly earlier start given the shorter days.\nNot suitable for dogs given sheep and livestock farms on route.\nThere are no toilets or shops on the route, so please bring a lunch, drink, and snacks with you.\nMain photograph taken by Robert Freeman and published under Creative Commons Licence (CC BY-SA 3.0 DEED) available from:\nhttps://shorturl.at/adqE1\n.

    "Summary": "Come to the mountains with a sense of adventure and embrace the remoteness!\nThe\nCarneddau\nis the northern most mountain range within Eryri National Park (Snowdonia), and is often referred to as the largest area of continuous upland in the UK, south of Scotland. It contains a significant number of\nWales' highest peaks and high mountain lakes\n. Most importantly (for the purposes of this event), it also contains our basic and remote accommodation.\nThe bunkhouse is basic!\nNot \"basic\" in the sense that it's not a hotel... BASIC basic. This is going to be a true mountain adventure, with a degree of challenge and hardship, but with the satisfaction of waking up deep within the Carneddau, far from the nearest road.\nOur mountain Cottage is owned by a mountaineering club and is around a\n3 mile walk in from the nearest parking area\n, just south west of Llyn Eigiau, at about 420m. There are basic cooking facilities, alpine style bunks, a chemical toilet, solar lighting and a cold tap!\nThe first part of the weekend will involve the logistics of getting us, our gear and our provisions from the car park to the cottage. Nearer the time we will discuss how best to do this, depending upon arrival times, car sharing etc, maybe with two meeting/set-off times, depending on leader availability.\nEveryone will need to do a share of the carrying and other chores.\nThis includes cooking and cleaning, lighting and tending to the coal stove, heating water and \"administering\" the toilet facilities (this apparently requires the use of a spade!).\nTo aid your planning we will probably look to meet around 2-3pm on Friday to walk in though as there are only 8 people on this event we can probably be a bit flexible and agree a time.\nAside from our cottage chores, the main part of the weekend will, of course, involve a walk on the Saturday within the mountains which are, quite literally, on our doorstep. There are a number of options which we can do from the front door.\nAt the end of March it's anyone's guess what the weather will be like. We will need to be prepared for cold and wet conditions, and nearer the time we will study the forecast carefully to enable us to make plans.\nDogs:\nsorry,\nthis event is not suitable for dogs.\nMain photos provided by Rugby Mountaineering Club and used with permission.\nOther photos by Mark House and Neil Williams, used with permission.",

From the bunk barn we're able to get up to Scafell Pike (with a strong, experienced group), or the local, spectacular summits of Borrowdale.  If that's not your thing, Keswick is a 20 minute drive away with plenty of history, cafe's and boats on Derwent Water.\nFriday night will be the traditional ODL buffet, with breakfast across the weekend and Saturday evening dinner included in you price!\nThe bunk house is remote, 30 minutes walk from the nearest bus stop, serviced by the 78 bus from Keswick.  Parking is available, but tight, so lift sharing is recommended.\nThe bunk house sleeps 26 in a room of 18 and a room of 8.\nPhotos\nare used with permission of lav_rich and K Fellfarers",

    "Summary": "The woods are lovely, dark and deep / But I have promises to keep / And miles to go before I sleep / And miles to go before I sleep.\n(Robert Frost:\nStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\n)\nUnlike the poet and his little horse, we won't have that many miles to go before we sleep, just ten; it won't be evening but daytime; you may or may not have promises to keep; and the woods will probably not be filling with snow. I wouldn't want so much snow that the trains and roads were scuppered, but just the right amount to evoke wonder and nostalgia. We'll probably get no snow and the weather will be mild and murky and the ground muddy, but a man can dream. What we are guaranteed is typical Wealden comfortable countryside, venerable villages, cosy company, and a substantial spread at a lovely pub, The George in Eartham, a venue new to us and eager to have us.\nThe sights:\nSlindon:\nA delightful brick and flint village on the southern slopes of the Downs. Only 70 metres up, but with a glorious view across the Sussex Plain to the sea. It is quite unspoilt, so much so that the National Trust has taken charge of the entire place. St Mary's church is over-restored (1866), but there is a lot of value inside. C11 nave walls and C12 chancel. Mediaeval pews. Monument to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1539), the only wooden effigy in a Sussex church and very well carved. Several fine houses of all ages all around. Nore Folly is just outside the village. A battlemented arch, built 1814, the attached summerhouse built for shooting luncheons is long gone. Grade II-listed.\nEartham:\nA tiny, unspoilt village of flint and brick in lovely countryside. Eartham House, which we might glimpse, is by Edwin Lutyens and is from 1905. Not one of his more inspired designs.\nHalnaker:\nA pleasant straggle of houses along the Roman Stane Street. Old Halnaker House is C14, now ruined, but New Halnaker House is also by Lutyens, of 1938. Very late and heavy. The grounds of the house were used as a filming location for Doctor Who in 1985 for the story\nRevelation of the Daleks,\nstanding in for the planet Necros. The Doctor and Peri ran along then climbed over a flint wall which we'll see.\nBoxgrove:\nContiguous with Halnaker and Tangmere, a small and quiet place considering the size of its church. One pretty main street of the now familiar brick, flint and tile houses. Boxgrove Common Quarry became celebrated in 1993 when the tibia and two teeth of the earliest known member of the genus\nHomo\nfound in the UK was uncovered. Back in 500,000 BC\nHomo heidelbergensis\nwas roaming a coastal shoreline that existed at the time, setting up camp and hunting and butchering horse and rhinoceros.\nBoxgrove Priory:\nThe church of St Mary and St Blaise is rather French-looking with its steeply pitched roofs and flying buttresses. Surrounded by modest monastic ruins. Before the Dissolution in 1538 the old nave, lying to the west, served as the parish church. The huge great chancel is now the parish church. The rhythm of column and vault in it is most satisfying. The delicate floral patterns were painted in the vault spaces in the mid-C16. Another treasure of the church is the De la Warre Chantry of 1532. An exquisite gothic box that takes its design from a C15 French Book of Hours. The architecture is late gothic, but the decoration is a mix of gothic and classical, even including some putti supporting the family crests. The vault is carved pendants. The church is rich in other works of art, including a reredos by George Gilbert Scott and stained glass in an Arts and Crafts style.\nThe bus:\nThe Stagecoach No. 500 bus leaves Tangmere every 30 minutes at 23 and 53 minutes past. It takes 15 minutes to get to Barnham Railway Station. A single ticket costs £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll take the mixed-use path north along Barnham Lane from Barnham to Walberton, then West Walberton Lane to Fontwell. We'll use the subway under the A27 and wander through Slindon Woods. Having reached the village itself we will take Top Road briefly then a footpath west past Nore Folly. The footpath will continue west to get to Eartham. We will then cross further west to reach the A285 and take a footpath southwest then north to Halnaker Mill which is where we will have lunch. We will descend the hill, have a slight detour past Boxgrove Common and then walk along the A285 (along the pavement), to take The Street south to Boxgrove and its priory. Then using a footbridge over the A27, we will skirt round Tangmere to get to the bus stop.\n(Photo credits: View south across open field at the north end of Slindon:\nPhoto\n©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Easterly view from Nore Hill:\nPhoto\n©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Courthill Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Wide Track in Eartham Woods:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The George Inn, Eartham:\nPhoto\n©\nKevin Gordon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

It's £8 each (paid to the cafe at the end of the session). We're a friendly bunch and it's always a good laugh.

Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for the Sheffield LBGTQ+ climbing night, starting with a social meet-up followed by some climbing. This will be an informal event, with team member(s) of the climbing centre there to offer advice and some supervision. The cost is the standard entry fee to the centre. Informal tuition will also be able from OutdoorLads, but this is dependent on numbers.\nAnyone can join the event, but please do sign up here so we can pass numbers on to the climbing centre.\nSo.... a bit about climbing and the centre..\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form. You can pay at the centre on arrival or online beforehand. If you pay in person at the centre a small discount is available if you mention you're with ODL.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nYes! Beginners are very welcome. If you've never climbed before, just let us know by messaging the event leader or co-leader, so we can arrange for you to be signed into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try. If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely. Please note that we are limited by the climbing centre as to the number of novice climbers we can supervise, according to the number of experienced people / staff available at the event.\nDo I have to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you can answer YES to all these questions, you can climb without supervision:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the UK. We are always keen to put more on, so if you fancy climbing in your local area contact a climbing leader and we can see what we can arrange.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by Keith.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not experts,  do not need to be experts, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as experts, but are amateurs with some experience in the event type and who are happy to impart their knowledge.  Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nBy signing up to and attending an OutdoorLads event, you are confirming that you have read, understood and accept the content of this statement.\nPlease see our website for more\ninformation including an FAQ\nabout our events.",

They are “\ntypically although not necessarily young, whose style is uniform, effortless but sophisticated\n.”\nThis 3.8 mile easy\nlinear walk\ncombines cultural sights:\nSaatchi Gallery – modern art which should provide some talking points\nRoyal Hospital for Chelsea Pensioners – visitor centre\nNational Army Museum – visit and lunch\nBlue plaques of artists and writers in Chelsea including Oscar Wilde’s London residence\nBattersea Park Peace Pagoda\nEnding at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station with optional drinks around 430pm at the Battersea Brewery.\nWe will stroll through Chelsea from Sloane Square visiting the indoor sights with a military angle and chi-chi streets filled with blue plaques,  before we cross the Thames to Battersea Park and Power Station.\nFor the indoor sights, I’ll explain the highlights and we will have time to explore independently. Each sight has free entry. We’ll spend around 1.5 hours at the National Army Museum, where we will have time for lunch.\nPlease note that your bags will be subject to a search at the National Army Museum and possibly the Saatchi Gallery. Please see under \"Security\"\nhere\n.\nPlease feel free to join for optional drinks at Battersea Power Station (Battersea Brewery booked), and you may wish to go on for dinner at one of the numerous restaurants there.\nDon't waste that space!\nThe maximum group size is 15 for this event. This is due to it being an urban walk and bookings have been made for the indoor attractions. Please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nThe sights\nSaatchi Gallery\nWe will start from Sloane Square and visit the free ground floor galleries of the Saatchi Gallery. The modern art can either be baffling or a talking point – you decide.\nCurrent free exhibitions 1,\n2\nand\n3\n.\nChelsea\nAlong the elegant streets of Chelsea, we will seek out the former residences marked with blue plaques of Mark Twain, PL Travers, Oscar Wilde, George Eliot, Dante Rossetti, Bob Marley, Captain Scott of the Antarctic and the grave of Hans Sloane.\nRoyal Hospital for Chelsea Pensioners\nThis is the home of the famous Chelsea Pensioners in their distinctive scarlet uniforms. The Royal Hospital was designed by Christopher Wren and the stable yard by John Soane. From the yard which was opened in late 2024 there is an interactive exhibition we will visit. Please note that the Hospital and Chapel can only be visited on a paid guided tour, which we will not do.\nSoane Stable Yard\nand\nExhibition\nNational Army Museum\nThe modern museum tells the stories of soldiers over 350 years of Britain up to the present day. These include global and European conflicts following its £23m redevelopment in 2017. There are currently exhibitions on military art and “Beyond Burma”. We will have around 1.5 hours to explore individually.\nMuseum page\nBattersea Park and Battersea Power Station\nAcross the Thames, we’ll visit the Buddhist Peace Pagoda in Battersea Park then continue to the redeveloped Battersea Power Station, the brick built and art deco power station built before the second war world and decommissioned in 1975-8. It’s now a temple to consumerism and high end apartments. The walk will end here with an optional drinks booked at\nBattersea Brewery\n. You may decide to eat nearby after.\nThe\nroute\ncan be seen on the OS Map, click\nhere\nwhich is included for guidance only.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs - sorry, no dogs are permitted at these sights.\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.",

Whether you are new to climbing or a seasoned climber, this centre offers something for everyone with a huge selection of routes including top rope, lead and auto belay.\nPrefer to boulder? That's well catered for as well, with an extensive modern bouldering area ensuring there is plenty to keep you busy, or you can swap between climbing and bouldering on the same night.\nClimbing is the main focus of the event, but this is also a great chance to meet other members and build lasting friendships. Many Outdoor Lads members join through climbing, so if you're new to the group and want to know more, come along and chat over a cuppa during the tea and cake break.\nWhat to expect on your first climb with us?\nIf you are an experienced climber and have passed the centre's proficiency test, we'll pair you up with a climbing buddy and you'll be out exploring the centre in no time.\nIf you have never climbed before or think you could do with a refresher, we offer supervised climbing sessions with one of our leaders, subject to availability. That session will focus on introducing you to climbing, making sure you get plenty of time on the wall whilst also showing you how to belay safely. Due to the centre's rules, we are limited in the number of climbers the leader is able to supervise in each session so if you think you may need a supervised session,\nplease contact the leader before signing up to make sure there is enough space.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nAfter a few supervised sessions, you should be ready to complete the centre's proficiency test and once that has been passed, you'll be able to climb with the rest of the group.\nEverything else you need to know\nYou will need to register with Big Depot before your first visit to the centre but you only need to do this once.

    "Summary": "Come join OutdoorLads for indoor climbing in North London!\nAt the biggest climbing centre in North London, there are 450 routes over 95 lines set across 1000 square metres of wall offering top-roping, lead climbing and bouldering on a wide range of slabs, cracks, overhangs, off-widths and chimneys - there really is something to suit every level of climbing ability!\nI've never climbed before, can I come along? YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

Weather permitting, it is planned to include a section of the well surfaced Strathkelvin Railway path between Strathblane and Kirkintilloch and a short stretch of the Forth and Clyde canal towpath - at least that's the mild weather option. On the other hand if icy paths are a risk, we have an alternative route up our sleeve that follows treated roads for almost the entire route.\nOur route will take us along the Bears Way to Milngavie and onto quieter roads towards Strathblane, where we have the option of either a cycle path to Kirkintilloch or road towards Queenzieburn before completing our circuit through Twechar, Moodiesburn and Stepps.\nMild weather route:\nhttps://ridewithgps.com/routes/53460004\nFrosty weather route:\nhttps://ridewithgps.com/routes/53460032\nThe pace of this ride will be typically 18-20 km/h and is best suited to road bikes, although riders on gravel bikes should also manage OK, particularly on the sections of cycle path.\nPhotos\n: Taken by the leader on previous rides in spring and summer and turned into more wintry looking pictures with the help of Microsoft Copilot™.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

We’ll stop here for lunch before making our way to the trig point.\nAfterwards, we’ll take a steady, steep descent to Moor Bottom, then follow the old Belmont Road to the landmark Pigeon Tower—the centrepiece of Rivington Terrace Gardens—which we’ll take time to explore before ending our walk with a final stretch past the impressive Rivington Great Barn.\nPhotos Copyright -\nJohnny Williams",

They settled on adapting a cricket pavilion in Shardlow. The location had two merits: firstly, it was equidistant between Nottingham, Derby and Leicester; secondly, its out-of-the-way position gave comfort to a lot of people who were very closeted. The residents of Shardlow soon sussed the nature of the club and called it the “Handbag Club”. It ran – with some ups and downs – until 1983, when it was burned down by a fire which was probably caused by an electrical fault.\nThe Pavilion Club in Shardlow was the final destination of a pub night called the 'Bona Ome' club which was tried out in several pubs in places like Langley Mill and Sneinton and also in the Navigation Pub at Shardlow.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage Credits:\nAll images supplied by event leader and their use by ODL is permitted.",

The venue offers a choice of toppings including a vegan option and also serves beer, wine and soft drinks. This should be a reasonably quiet venue, as it's a small one, enabling good conversation without a lot of background noise. More details about the venue can be found\nhere\nNew to OutdoorLads?

We’re a friendly bunch, and everyone’s welcome.\nNew Year Empty Feeling\nAfter all of the festivities of the Christmas and New Year period have come to an end and it's time to get back to work and those normal routines resume, January can feel like a long and uneventful month whilst we are still enduring the middle of winter. It’s easy to feel a little more isolated at this time of the year so that’s why these social events are so important!

the Keswick to Barrow Challenge is back for 2026!\nWhat is it?\nWell, it's a very long walk - approximately 40 miles from just outside Keswick to Barrow-in-Furness with about 2000m of climb (spread out over a long way - it's not a mountain walk, don't worry!)\nBut it's more than that...\nIt's a charity fundraiser - we'll be collecting sponsorship to split between OutdoorLads and other charities nominated by the K2B Foundation who organise the event as well as the costs of running the event.\nIt's a massive achievement  - when you cross the finish line you'll feel amazing (and maybe think about doing it again next year?)\nIt's a huge event - with teams from all over the country, both smaller ones like ours and from big companies, fundraising for all manner of different charities.\nCan I actually do that?\nIt might be a long way - but as a bit of a veteran of quite a few endurance events your leader has every confidence!  You will want to do some training, though, few people can manage this sort of thing without.  Unsurprisingly the best form of training for walking is more walking...so why not sign up for some ODL walks and build up your distance!  There's no need to do super-long distances in training, though, just plenty of walking and be sure to try out any kit you're planning on using on the day.\nThe team\nThere's a minimum team size of 4 for the event (but we can enter more and we hope we will!) - however that's more for administrative reasons and we don't have to walk together throughout the event, so whether you're an accomplished ultramarathon runner and reckon you'll get round in 5 hours, or whether you're a walker who'd rather enjoy the scenery and take all day, it's all good.  If people do want to walk together that's also great, though, and we can provide each other some support along the way - there'll be plenty of time to talk about things like that on the run-up to the event.  Either way, you'll never be on your own with the hundreds of others taking part!\nAccommodation\nIf you live locally and can get dropped off at the start at the crack of dawn you don't necessarily need accommodation.  However for the rest of us we typically look at accommodation for the weekend in Barrow so there isn't far to go at the end of the walk (you'll probably not be in a fit state to drive anywhere!).  In previous years the Premier Inn (where your leader is staying) and Travelodge have offered good options but there's lots available so you can pick somewhere that suits your budget etc.  Don't book Saturday breakfast - you'll be up and out far too early for that :)\nWe usually meet up for a meal and a drink or two on the Friday early evening before a reasonably early night before the walk (and some walk related admin e.g. giving numbers out) - likely this will be near the Premier Inn but we can work that out depending on where people are staying.\nGetting to the start\nThe organisers provide what they call a \"Happy Bus\" coach service from many of the Barrow hotels to get you to the start - this leaves in the early hours of Saturday morning (3-4am!) which might be where the name came from (er!) - this is bookable at a small charge later on.  You can also have someone drop you off at the start if you have someone to do that but there is no parking available there so we do recommend the bus.  There isn't a bus the other way which is why we tend to stay in Barrow (also it tends to be a lot cheaper than Keswick for hotels etc).\nFundraising\nEach walker needs to raise £80 to take part in the event as a minimum, which is to be donated via the K2B website and not other sites e.g. JustGiving.  You'll get a personalised link to raise sponsorship which you can send out to as many people as possible to help reach your target!\nSounds great - how do I sign up?\nThere are a few things you'll need to do to get signed up:\nRegister an account on the K2B website at the below link and message the leader your Member ID so I can add you to the team when it has been set up.  If you already have a registration from previous years you can use the same one, you don't need to create a new one.\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/user/register\nSign up to this event page.\nOnce I've confirmed we have a minimum team of 4 signed up, book accommodation (this is at your own cost).  As prices can and do go up as the event approaches, it might be worth doing this sooner if there are suitable refundable options.  The leader is staying in the Premier Inn in Barrow but there are plenty of other options if that's not to your taste.  Don't book Saturday breakfast as you'll be leaving way too early for that!\nWhen looking for accommodation note the bus pickups are really early (around 3-4am).  The event buses do serve places other than Barrow itself but you'd need to get yourself from Barrow back to those places after the walk.\nNote that if we only have 4 and someone drops out that doesn't stop us walking - we just need a minimum of 4 signed up to confirm the team.\n(Provisional bus information:\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/happy-buses\n)\nYou will then need to pay your entry fee which is £15, and book your bus seat at £10.\nOnce we have the team all set up you'll be able to start collecting sponsorship via your own page on the K2B website - good luck!\nRemember there is a minimum commitment to raise £80 to be allowed to walk\n- this is the K2B's rule, not ours - so start in plenty of time :)\nDogs\nDogs are allowed on the K2B event itself BUT are not allowed on the event buses nor in most hotels, so if you intend to bring one (make sure it can walk 40 miles!) you will need to check arrangements carefully and arrange your own transport to the start (noting again that it's drop-off only, no parking is allowed anywhere near the start).  Dogs are allowed on the field at the finish but must be on a lead.\nObviously assistance dogs are allowed should you require one for a disability but please let the leader know if you are bringing an assistance dog so I can let the organisers know.\nPhoto credits\nThe photos on this event page were taken by previous participants/leaders including Danny McKeown-Henshall and are used with permission.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced (independent) climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners (supervised) event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

It'll be a full moon but the moon won't rise while we're on the\nGreat Orme\n, so we should get complete darkness on the far side. On a clear night the Iights of the\nIsle of Man, Liverpool\nand\nBlackpool\nare clearly visible.\nEven if you've walked the Great Orme before, night hiking gives you a great way to see everything in a different light. We'll seek out vantage points to ensure we get a cracking night view of\nLlandudno.\nIf you haven't given night hiking a go before this walk should make a good introduction and is a good way to avoid the pubs/bars on a\nSaturday night\n, plus burn off some of the excesses of Christmas.\nImage / photo credits: All leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nPlease be advised that the person leading this night hike has experience in night walking and has undertaken many similar excursions on the Great Orme in the past. While they possess a certain level of proficiency and familiarity with the terrain, it is crucial to note that they are not considered experts in nocturnal outdoor activities.\nNight hiking poses its own set of challenges, including reduced visibility and potential changes in terrain perception. The event leader is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience but participants should be aware of the inherent risks associated with venturing into natural environments after dark. You must pay close attention to the leader's instructions and guidance throughout the hike.\nBy choosing to participate in this night hike, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with hiking in low-light conditions.",

    "Summary": "There’s a particular magic to a January walk across heathland. The piercing air, the palette of pewter and bronze and steel, the promise of a fresh start. As we move through russet heather and dun grasses, the limitless sky echoes our New Year’s resolve to be more active, more connected, more open to community. The occasional Dartford warbler reminds us that even in winter, life finds a way. The chill begins to gnaw, but the thought of a cosy pub in the historic village of Thursley spurs us on: steaming plates, open fires, shared laughter. It'll be a perfect reminder of what OutdoorLads embodies: turning exertion into excitement and celebrating our common countryside and culture.\nThe sights:\nWitley Common\n:\nAn area of woodland and heath, and an SSSI. It features Bronze Age burial mounds and has been used as common land by many generations. During World War II it was home to 20,000 soldiers prior to D-Day. Today it is managed by the National Trust to provide a mixture of habitats for wildlife.\nThursley and Ockley Commons:\nAnother SSSI and National Nature Reserve. Crossbill, red kite, woodlark and stonechat are seen regularly, and Dartford warbler, whinchat, wheatear, redstart and tree pipit may be. The series of ponds, linked by a boardwalk, are especially biodiverse.\nThursley:\nAn immaculate and unsuburbanised village. The Norse name and origins of the place are interesting: 'Thor's Lee', and the village sign depicts the god wielding his hammer. St Michael's Church is almost all new after a restoration in 1860, but C12 and C13 century fragments remain. In he churchyard is a stone in memory of a sailor who was travelling to Portsmouth but was murdered by three villains at Hindhead in 1786. The murderers were caught and hanged before their remains were gibbeted at Hindhead. The cottages in the village are among the best in Surrey, for instance Olde Hall and Wheeler's Farm are C17, and Badgers and Vine Cottage are early C18. Horn Cottage C16.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is absolutely ideal for them with very few stiles, busy roads and fields with livestock. The pub is good with dogs too. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link to see it):\nWe'll follow Rake Lane to the A283 then go north along it, turning west at Milford Heath Road. We'll then turn south and use a bit of Haslemere Road before entering the heathland at Sandy Lane and using a bridleway to go to under the A3 at Mousehill and all the way to Ockley Common and Pudmore Pond. At Moat Pond we'll cross Thursley Road and use a bridleway to go along Woolfords Lane north. A boardwalk across the heath and footpaths will then take us south to Thursley for lunch. We'll walk up The Street to Dyehouse Lane and go to The Three Horseshoes. The Greensand Way will take us out of Thursley. At Foldsdown we'll pick up another bridleway to go under the A3 and bridleways will take us to French Lane which we'll head north along. At Millhanger and French Hill where a meandering route will take us across Witley Common and Mare Hill until we get to Wheelers Lane which we'll walk east along to the A283 as far as a bridleway at Crossways to go back to the station past Enton Lakes.\n(Picture credits: Thursley Common from the Plateau: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Thursley Common: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Thursley Common Boardwalk: Photo ©\nMark Percy\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Thursley Common: bridleway by Parish Field: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Badgers, Thursley: Photo ©\nDavid960\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Horn Cottage, Thursley (2): Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Thursley - Sunset Cottage: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bridleway on the edge of Witley Common Photo ©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Ockley Common: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement.

On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "Join Alex for this 12-mile hike along the Harcamlow Way, via the villages of Hunsdon and Gilston.\nOur walk begins at Harlow Town station and will take us westwards along the meadering banks of the River Stort, passing the Victorian Parndon Mill, which now serves as an arts centre. We will weave our way between Essex and Hertfordshire as we cross a number of locks across the river. On the outskirts of Roydon we will turn northwards and head uphill for a couple of miles across open farmland towards the pretty village of Hunsdon. Here we will stop for lunch.\nUpon leaving the village we will turn east across an old Second World War air force base, RAF Hunsdon, still in use for small aircraft. Our route then leads us towards the noticeable spire of St Mary's church in the small settlement of Gilston, a Grade-I listed building dating from the 13th century. After passing the church we will head south through the picturesque grounds of Gilston Park, a 19th century country house, now converted into apartments.\nHeading back to Harlow Town station, we will return to the River Stort for a short while. Just before the station our route divides: either directly back or via the riverside Moorhen pub.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "Please note that this walk takes place on a Monday.\nYou came, and looked and loved the view, Long-known and loved by me, Green Sussex fading into blue, With one gray glimpse of sea.\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson: 'Green Sussex'\nLooking slightly more grey and muted than green, you'll nevertheless share Tennyson's sentiments about the view from his handsome hillside home on this strenuous but satisfying stride. Starting from Haslemere yet again, we'll soon leave Surrey, enter West Sussex and ascend its highest hill: the great whale-backed bluff of Blackdown. There, from the Temple of the Winds viewpoint, we'll survey the landscape that we'll explore: the low-lying but pretty patchwork of meadows, ponds, copses and villages of the western Low Weald. Probably prettiest of the villages is Lurgashall, where we'll have lunch in the Noah's Ark pub which dates back to the sixteenth century.\nThe sights:\nBlackdown:\nA rugged greensand plateau, 280m high, cared for by the National Trust. It is named after the dark pine trees that cap its summit. Its human history is interesting: Middle-Stone Age (6000BC) people dwelt there; smugglers hid their contraband in caves there; London was alerted to the coming of the Spanish Armada by a beacon there; and in 1967, Iberian Airlines Flight 062 crashed there due to a faulty altimeter reading; Alfred, Lord Tennyson, lived there at Aldworth House; and from 1796 to 1816 the navy had a shutter telegraph station there.\nLow Weald:\n\"The wooded and watery Low Weald...is a low-lying gently undulating landscape of clay vales and gentle ridges of limestone and sandstone. The landscape is small-scale, intimate and tranquil with a medieval pattern of small irregular pasture fields enclosed by a strong network of shaws [thickets] and tall, thick, species-rich hedgerows.\" (West Sussex Landscape: The Low Weald Character Area)\nLurgashall:\nA beautiful village around a triangular green. The houses are mostly stone, but with some tile-hanging to indicate the closeness of Surrey. St Laurence's Church is attractive, C11, with a C13 chancel, and C16 aisle. The Noah's Ark Inn (named thus because drinkers had to cross the village pond on a gangplank to reach it) is C16. It also has a village shop.\nThe\nroute\n(please check this at the OS website to see the elevations)\n:\nWe'll head southeast through Haslemere through Shepherd's Hill and Haste Hill to pick up Chase Lane which will take us up, along with the Sussex Border Path and Serpent's Trail, Blackdown's plateau. After breaking at The Temple of the Winds, we'll go on a zigzag descent to Quellwood Common and Windfall Wood Common. Here, High Lane and Dial Green Lane will take us to Lurgashall for lunch. Blind Lane will take us to Crossways, and then Hillgrove Lane to Hillgrove. Bullock Lane track will take us to Jobson's Lane and a footpath to Roundhurst Common. Arriving at Aldworth, we'll walk beside the B2131 (there's a pavement) back to Haslemere.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them although there will be considerable lane walking and fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be obedient. Dogs are welcome in the pub at lunchtime.\n(All pictures taken by the leader in November 2021 and December 2024. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "A\n14 km\nmid-winter walk above the town of Rochdale, with superb views stretching from the Pennines across to the Wrekin, Welsh Hills and Snowdon.\nThe landscape was shaped by glaciers 10 000 BCE, followed by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, early farmers and more recently, local farming communities and the miners of the Rossendale Coalfield, along with the needs of the industrial revolution and ever-growing towns.\nHighlights of the walk include;\nThe summit of Knowl Hill at 419m and taking in the views before us. Flint tools and arrowheads have been found at the summit, dating from Mesolithic (15000 – 5000 BCE) to Bronze Age (1200 BCE) times.\nWalking around the reservoirs in the Naden Valley. The Naden reservoirs were built in the 1840’s above Green Booth village. Greenbooth reservoir was built in the 1950s to meet the further demands of water for Rochdale and opened in 1965, submerging the village.\nView across Ashworth Moor Reservoir. Completed in 1905, during the digging, a palstave, a Bronze Age axe-like implement, cast from bronze was discovered. It remains a relatively rare find in the county, with only six others of this type being discovered. The palstave dates from around 1400-1200BC and is housed in Manchester Museum.\nOur walk will finish  at Owd Betts pub.\nImage / photo credits:  All leaders own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nDon’t worry if the event is full.\nDo sign up\nand join the waiting list.\nOften those on the main list cancel nearer the time.\nThere is a very high chance you will still get a place",

    "Summary": "It's a new year so surely that deserves an ODL hike for the first Saturday!\nThis is a circular hike starting and finishing in Pulborough. We'll take in a variety of sights and enjoy varied terrain. Given the time of year there is a good balance between woodland paths and very quiet tarmac roads. The highlight will be visiting the ruins of a church in Bedham. Much of the building still exists and it is a real joy to see.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nStopham Bridge\nThis bridge crosses the River Arun and is one of two we cross during our hike. The Stopham Bridge dates back to about 1423 and is a Grade I scheduled monument. One arch was destroyed during the English Civil War, which resulted in a drawbridge being added. This in turn was later replaced and in 1822 the centre was raised to allow larger boats to pass under.\nStopham Church\nMuch of this church dates back to the 11th century and inside it is a real treasure trove.  There are various plaques, stained glass windows and artefacts all depicting various events that have taken place.\nBedham Church\nBuilt in 1880 and also known as St Michael and All Angels Church. This delightful ruin was once home to a school and a church. The main single room was simply divided in two by a curtain so lessons and prayer could take place together. Sadly, due to Bedham being a hamlet and a declining population lessons stopped in 1925. The church itself continued until 1959 when services then stopped. A lovely structure, although now without a roof, it is a joy to visit. Given its location partly hidden in woodland it also feels like it has so many stories to tell.\nCoombelands\nYou'd think this massive site would have been here generations. Yet it was only in 1996 that things got serious.  The site is vast and and as well as training race horses; they host events and have a farm to boot.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend.

I am happy to consider opening more slots if there is enough interest.\nEscape the Christmas madness for a few hours — ditch the turkey, sprouts, and endless small talk with relatives who\nstill\ndon’t get it. Instead, grab some fresh air, take in the views, burn off those extra Xmas calories, and sample the delights of a cosy country pub.\nThis walk explores one of the most scenic areas of the Chilterns, the Hamble Valley, including extensive wooded hills and valley floor. The Hamble Valley was one of the first places in the Chilterns to be occupied by man due to it's lush valley and flowing brooks, making it ideal for early settlements. It is also close to the Thames which was a major highway before roads became a viable option.\nWe will start in the scenic village of Hambleden, known for its timeless charm and has attracted the attention of filmmakers and TV producers over the years, including the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice and the area in general is synonymous with \"The Vicar of Dibley\" and \"Midsomer Murders\", but with the latter don't be put off as it's not the murder capital of the UK!\nFrom Hambleden we will initially venture west including a climb up the valley through the extensive Great Wood with it's beech woodland. Taking a series of paths and quiet lanes, at the half way point we reach the quiet hamlet of Southend. From Southend we take the Chilterns Way for a while, going downhill with views over to Turville and it's distinctive windmill. We then wind back up and then downhill through more woodland to eventually arrive at the village of Skirmett, with it's jumble of flint and brick houses. After Skirmett we will take a flat route along the bottom of the valley back to Hambleden, with the option to visit the pub for a festive drink.\nThe route - click this link in\nred\nto see it.\nDogs:\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are a few stiles on route and quiet lane sections and crossings but generally the going is suitable for dogs to be off the lead for much of the time.

    "Summary": "Energize the New Year.\nPut a spring in your step with a walk up the Titterstone Clee Hill. Join me for a fresh 8 mile circuit of the Clee, with a little over 400 metres of ascent, and work off around 1700 calories!\nSee from Snowdonia to the Cotswolds.\nThe Titterstone Clee Hill has tremendous views. It is the most southerly of Shropshire's highest peaks, rising to 533 metres above sea level. The vistas are glorious in clear weather: all the way from Hay Bluff in the Brecon Beacons to Cadair Idris in Snowdonia, Wales; from the Cotswolds to the Peak District in England as well as the other Shropshire Hills and Malverns.\nExplore boulder field and quarry.\nLayer after layer of different forms of rock created a rich mixture of geology on the Clee, which was glaciated 10 000 and more years ago. This left a huge boulder field to the west and a pile of periglacial boulders near the summit, known as the Giant's Chair, which we shall see on our walk. Several quarries over the centuries exploited the rock, and there are remains of older tramways and cut rock seams. The lower quarry is still in use for roadstone. The quarry near the summit is in process of being opened for rock climbing by negotiation between the BMC and site owners. We will explore the summit quarry on our way to the top.\nThousands of years of history.\nNear the summit are remains of a Bronze Age cairn, from around 4000 years ago. 2500 years back, the hill became an Iron Age hill fort with stone banks, instead of more common earthly ones. In medieval times the hill was recorded in Hereford Cathedral's Mappa Mundi. The Titterstone Clee was the setting for one of the Cadfael series of historical novels:\n'The Virgin in the Ice'\nby Ellis Peters.\nScientific fact and fiction.\nYou will recognise the Clee from a more modern feature: a gold ball like antenna on the top. Originally a secret monitoring station in World War Two, this is now an important radar for air traffic control. If you've played video games you may recognise the hill from Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The Clee is Scriopescire, a whole region to explore in the game.\nI walked this circuit last winter and really enjoyed bounding over the boulders and taking in the fresh air. I recognised the furthest hills in the distance, so I can confirm you really can see that far! So, what better than to share this with you for the New Year.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?   Sign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nAll images are taken by FrankieB and may be used by Outdoorlads.",

    "Summary": "Come and walk the old railways of Granton, Newhaven & Leith and burn off those Christmas excesses!\nLong before the phrase Active Travel entered government lexicon Lothian Regional Council started buying old railway trackbeds from British Rail, as BR went about removing the railway network in the 70s and 80s that had existed across the north of Edinburgh. This foresightedness has left a legacy of a network of popular paths crossing the city.\nThis figure of eight walk covers a large proportion of these lines, starting from Scotland Street station which was the original terminus of the Edinburgh, Leith & Newhaven railway when it opened in August 1842. From here we head north to Trinity and west to Granton. Here the EL&G (having decided that it wanted to go to Granton, not just Newhaven) met the Caledonian and we take up the Caleys route south to Crew junction before heading east to Leith. From Leith we pick up the EL&G again which takes us back to Scotland Street.\nApart from one detour near Chancelot, the route is entirely on tarmac paths as the council have improved these railway paths for cyclists. Whilst most of the routes are as they were when rails ran along them much has changed around them, so is an interesting perspective on the changing face of Edinburgh and Leith.\nPhotos :\nTaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.",

    "Summary": "Join Outdoor Lads for a winter ramble through the central Peak District; taking in beautiful panoramas, atmospheric forests and old remote churches, followed by a trip to the local country pub.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nTegg's Nose Country Park:\nFormerly a sandstone quarry, the park now offers a large network of trails on the border of the Peak District.  We'll hike up to the parks highest point, giving us great views over Cheshire & Greater Manchester.\nMacclesfield Forest:\nA historic royal hunting forest that was owned by the Earl of Chester; Macclesfield Forest is now a mix of planted coniferous and native deciduous woodlands, and home to many bird and animal species. We'll pass through different parts of the forest, including a visit to St Stephen's Church , the \"Forest Chapel\", which has been on the edge of the forest since 1673.\nShutlingsloe:\nAt 506m, the perhaps hyperbolically nicknamed '\"Cheshire Matterhorn\", is a distinctively shaped hill south east of Macclesfield Forest and the highest point of our walk. The ascent isn't too long but is very steep, so we'll take our time with this section. Once on top, we'll be greeted with spectacular views of the rest of the Peak District National Park, much of Cheshireand Greater Manchester, and even as far as The Clwydian Range in North Wales.\nOther Infomation:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "This hike is about 14km (8.5 miles) with ~600m of ascent. While there's nothing particularly difficult on this walk, due to the time of year, it may be very wet and muddy or icy, so good footwear is needed.",

If there is a risk of lightning or extreme winds, we may need to shelter for many hours or curtail the event. All pictures taken in the Black Mountains during wild camps. If we are very fortunate, we will get to hike and camp in snow; it’s rather more likely to be very wet and somewhat windy.\nThis will give you an idea of the environment\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33506589\nNB This is very much an extreme situation and should not scare you off, the story is a number of years old and an MOD based exercise.\nFollowing a meal at 6pm in the Bear (High Street, NP8 1BW, which is less than 100m from the car park  in Crickhowell, we will make sure we are ready to leave the car park at7:45pm. It will  then be a 5 minute drive to the secluded lay-by where we will leave our cars at the hike start point. Then in darkness a steep ascent to the ramparts of the ancient Crug Hywel hill fort to get to the top of Table Mountain (451m). Another 340m of ascent will get us over Pen Cerrig-Calch (701m), to then find a place to sleep at an altitude of about 650m if the weather is kind. We’ll get up at dawn and then to the top of Pen Allt Mawr (719m), for an early morning panoramic view across all of the Black mountains; followed by Pen Twyn Glas (646m) and Mynydd Llysiau (663m) to get to the highest summit Waun Fach (810m). We then continue over Pen y Gadair Fawr before finding a suitable place to spend our second night high in the mountains. The next day we have Pen Twyn Mawr (658m), Disgwylfa (540m), Crug Mawr (550m) and Blaen-yr Henbant (498m) to contend with, before descending to go over the Upper Cwm Bridge over the Grwyne Fechan, past the ancient church (first recorded in 1060) and into the village of Llanbedr and on to our cars.\nNote that the maximum number of attendees will be increased to 8, if any Mountain (Trail) Leaders join the event,\nDogs:\nDogs are not allowed on this event.\nPhoto Credits\n: All photos taken by Paul Ridealgh; permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "This 6 mile circular walk starts off in the shadow of Caernarfon Castle from the quay where thousands of tons of slate were exported during the 19th century. We will cross the river on the swing bridge and go to a viewpoint over the town, where the mountains of Eryri form an impressive backdrop. We'll then take the Wales coast path (a minor road at this point) which has lovely views of the Menai Straits for a couple of miles. After that we will head inland crossing a small hill with further views, and through some farms to pick up the course of the Welsh Highland steam railway where the trains which are pulled by very unique locomotives which articulate in the middle and have two sets of driving wheels to cope with the bends and gradients through the Snowdon Mountain Range. A footpath follows this back into the town. Caernarfon is a walled  town with nearby Roman origins, however the castle and walls were built in the 13C by the English King Edward 1st, after the ruler of Gwynedd refused to pay homage to the English. It is now a designated World Heritage Site and the imposing castle is one of the largest in Wales. Dolphins are often seen just offshore. The little streets within the town walls are picturesque and fascinating to explore. A short tour around town will round of the event.\nMeal Out\nAfter the walk there's an option to have a meal together at the\nHistoric Black Boy inn\nThere's a good range of food and drink and no need to book.\nPlease note the event end time will depend on factors on the day doesn't include the meal / social element.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified at least 24 hours beforehand in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event. Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group.\nAre you new to OutdoorLads and considering your first event?  This is a good event for first timers.\nHave a look at this link for some useful information:\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nPhotos:\nAndyM, event leader\nWaitlisted?

    "Summary": "This walk is a more challenging route, not for the fainthearted or those with less walking experience. A lot of the sections make use of unfrequented paths and there are several climbs (some that are fairly steep) spread throughout the walk.  If you are feeling fighting fit and want to test those legs, join Steven for this near thirteen mile rewarding round in the remote Yorkshire Dales.\nWaterfalls are a big feature of this walk and several are seen at close quarters, others glimpsed from afar. The deep valley of Upper Swaledale cuts into the Pennines and was justifiably chosen by Alfred Wainwright for his Coast to Coast route.  Mother nature has truly excelled here and the abandoned farmsteads just add to the feeling of isolation.\nWe follow part of Alfred Wainwright's route for almost a quarter of the walk , The leader walked this path on his first expedition twenty years ago, so expect many tales about this on the way downhill.\nThe walk starts with a climb up above the four hundred metre contour. There will be plenty of pauses for a breather/drink or photograph, Then, as the contours become kinder, extensive views are revealed on the watershed.  A lot of the nearby high Pennines are in view. Great Shunner Fell looks lofty from here and the limestone scars are seen at close quarters on the following descent.\nThe path down in the dale wanders through the maze of dry stone walls to the other side of the valley and, after a short break, another climb on an indistinct trail rises before a very gradual descent over grouse moor leads back to the River Swale and a small waterfall by a bridge.\nSeveral stone barns are passed as the route weaves up to the remote spot of Ravenseat. The farm has featured in a television series and the Yorkshire Shepherdess might greet us here.\nAnother slower ascent follows skirting a ravine before reaching a broader moor, passing another ruin and then above a tree-covered limestone scar descends to the opposite side of the Swale to Keld and a visit to a series of beautiful waterfalls.\nIf time allows, we will walk over to the inn on the other side of the village before doing the easy gradual descent of the walk.\nIf you would like a full day out and need a good bit of exercise please come along and see a remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales , You might be inspired to walk the 192 miles of the Coast to Coast yourself some time soon.\nThis route is suitable for well behaved dogs. There is livestock in many fields and there are some sections where your pet might need to be assisted over dry stone wall crossings.\nPhoto Credits - All photographs were taken by the walk leader.

This year we are making it bigger and better than ever, with a choice of tents, pods, campervans or a hostel to bring together as many members as possible to launch the celebrations!\nThere are four accommodation options for this event, please ensure you book on to the correct one:\nTent pitch\nMotorhome/Campervan pitch\nPod\nHostel\n(this event page)\nFor anyone who doesn't want to camp in February but still would like to join in the first of our 20th birthday celebration events, we have a limited number of places available in this great little hostel, three miles (12 minutes drive) from the main group at the campsite. This is an opportunity to join in with the walks and fun planned for over the weekend whilst still having a warm and dry bed to come back to, for those for whom camping in February doesn't have the same appeal. To note, you'll need to sort out your own transport between the campsite and the hostel - the plan is to be down with the group on Saturday evening to celebrate OutdoorLads turning 20!\nOn the Saturday there'll be a range of walk and activity options of varying difficulties. They will vary depending on the conditions at the time, but in this part of the country, every walk is a stunner and there are lots of options - very likely there will be a harder mountain walk and something a bit easier, but there will still be lots of ascent involved - this is the Lake District after all.\nOn the Sunday we hope you'll stay around for another, shorter walk. We aim to be finished around mid-afternoon.\nDepending on the conditions, there may also be the opportunity to learn/improve your winter walking skills as we have three great winter walking leaders on hand to share their knowledge and experience.\nBreakfasts both days are included in the price, as well as tea and coffee all weekend, and on Saturday evening, catering is provided down at the campsite with the rest of the group. This is all included in the event price. You will need to make your own arrangements for food on Friday evening.\nBirthday Celebrations\nOn the Saturday evening at 6pm we plan to host a spectacular Hog Roast with all the trimmings and some more on the campsite.  The food is fully included in the event price, and there are other options provided for those with dietary requirements, don't worry!\nWe will have some marquees up for \"indoor\" space for socialising and you can of course being your own drinks but do bring a chair to sit on, the ground will be cold and/or wet.\nThis is a great chance to relax with your OutdoorLads friends, reminisce over the last 20 years,  laugh about the good times, the bad fancy dress decisions and the challenging climbs! It's likely a trip to a local pub will follow on from the hog roast.\nDogs\n: This event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nTaken by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

The hope is that there will be some snow about, and for that you will need to bring crampons and an ice axe - plus be proficient in their use.\nFor this bunkhouse you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

Alternatively, some more dramatic mountain walking can be found within a short drive.\nThe activities:\nas we'll have two full days at our disposal, there will be an opportunity to take maximum advantage of this varied, beautiful region. Exact walks on offer will depend upon leaders attending, but will likely include at least one easier and one tougher walk each day. Wales' highest waterfall (Pistyll Rhaeadr) isn't far, with the adjacent Berwyn Mountains. Llangollen is always popular, as is the fascinating Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.\nNew Year's Eve:\nwhile this event is not intended to be a \"party event\", we will, of course, mark the arrival of the new year. Think dinner with friends, silly games, and general merriment :)\nThe accommodation\n: Our accommodation is well-equipped and comfortable, across a bunkhouse and cottages, with shared rooms of varying sizes (max. 8). Bedding is provided, but you'll need your own towel.\nDogs:\nThis venue is not suitable for dogs.\nOUTDOORLADS FOUNDATION\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense? Apply for a place on this event through the OutdoorLads Foundation! Nobody apart from staff members will know and we don't need lots of financial info from you either.

    "Summary": "The Derby '\nNomad Way\n' is an 80 km (50 mile) recreational route circumnavigating the City of Derby. The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley\n- Sat 22 November 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey - 8.8 km (5.5 miles)\nWe will visit St. Matthew's Parish Church in\nMorley\nto discover some in-built remains from Dale Abbey and view the Sacheverell-Bateman Mausoleum. The (converted) Tithe Barn and Dovecote at Morley Hall are also of interest.\nTh Church of St. Andrew, much restored in 1875, retains a few Norman features from its 12th century origin, a 14th century font and interesting Jacobean Pulpit.\nStanley\nColliery, closed in 1959, was a drift-mine or 'footrill', nicknamed 'Nibbl'um or 'Nibby Pit' due to the coal-owners constantly cutting wages. In former times, the smooth white sandstone from Stanley Quarry was used to produce 'donkey-stones' used for polishing theshold steps. The 'White Hart' is open all day for refreshments.\nReturn bus service (Black Cat) to Derby available from Stanley.\nThis is 'The Flourish' and site of the former 'Stanhope Arms', on the old Derby-Nottingham route. Legend had it that the notorious outlaw Uthlagas preyed on the traveller s but after dreaming of the Abbey in Depedale, he became a reformed character and then lived as a hermit.\nWe will take short detour from the route to visit Derbyshire's only remaining wooden post-mill - The Cat and Fiddle Windmill - built in 1788, where we will have lunch at the\nWindmill Farm Cafe\n.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

Passing natural river islands, home to some probably rare birds such as white ones and grey ones.Until we arrive at Ditchford lock.\nPassing on through the nature reserve we will soon have our lunch stop in sight.\nLunch will be in the town of Irthlingborough where there are various cafes bars and shops including fish and chips.  Meet back by church/co op car park before heading off towards Finedon and the River Ise.\nFollowing the River Ise south will lead us back to the industrial wastelands of Wellingborough and the station where we end.\nThis walk is suitable for dogs.

    "Summary": "The full price of the event is £516 for full and concession members, and £586 for PAYG members.\nIf you are interested in coming along, but the monastery is full, go to this\n\"Book Your Own Accoms\"\npage and you will still be able to join us!  In order to participate in the week's events you\nMUST\nbook through the \"BYOA\" page so that you are covered through the OutdoorLads insurance.\nSpend a week in the beautiful hills outside Rome and #getoutmore in Italy!  After almost 9 years, ODL returns to this beautiful 1,600 year old monastery 45 minutes northeast of Rome.  Fully modernised and capable of accommodating 12 guests, this building will be our base for a week of hiking and cultural immersion in the Lazio region.\nThis is a week away in Italy where the focus will be on getting out more and exploring the area on foot, enjoying the views and sights and the company of fellow OutdoorLads members; and a chance to enjoy the culture and tourist sights of Italy, too, rather than a chill-out holiday. So come and enjoy fantastic break away with us and get acquainted with this beautiful region!\nOur accommodation at the monastery features four twin-bedded rooms, and two double rooms (if you are coming as a couple or friends who don't mind sharing, please let the leader know!) and a full kitchen. Simple breakfasts, and tea and coffee are provided all week, as are two group evening meals. For the other evening meals you can self-cater, eat out, or those that wish to can shop, cook at eat together as a group - we can make arrangements for that when we arrive.\nNo transport is included, you will need to book and pay for all your own travel including flights and transport to the accommodation, and any transport whilst there. There is parking for four cars at the monastery if you wish to hire a car, but this would be at your own additional cost.\nItinerary and arrangements\nThe (adjustable) itinerary will look something like this. Please note that most tickets for attractions cannot be booked until at least 75 days in advance.  You would need to book and pay for tickets for any of these yourself, they are not included in the price.\nFriday 24 July\nShould you arrive at the monastery before 16.00, you will need to wait in the courtyard as there will be no access into the building.  I will meet the housekeeper at 16.00 and will need time to go through the preliminaries before allowing everyone in.\nThe train from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (Fiumicino Airport) to\nTivoli\ntakes around 2.5 hours, with a change required in Rome. Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around €11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli. Make sure you do not book to Tivoli Terme, as that is 30 minutes before Tivoli itself.\nThere are no activities planned for today, other than a communal dinner buffet.\nSaturday 25 July\nPlan on an early start to enjoy this (slightly longer than) 8.15km\nGrotto delle sirene\nloop through the village of Tivoli. We will walk down to the village from the monastery to the \"official\" starting point. This route covers very gently rolling village streets and paths, with an elevation gain of 160 metres and a loss of 150 metres.  Good trainers or walking shoes should should be adequate.\nLunch can either be brought from the monastery or can be purchased from one of the local shops.  Alternatively a trattoria lunch can be arranged at the end of the walk, as we will be in the village.\nSunday 26 July\nAs this is the last Sunday of the month the Vatican Museums\nMIGHT\nbe free (at least they were in 2025). If we decide to do this, the last entry into the Museum is at 12.30 so we would plan on leaving the monastery early, to try and avoid the queues as much as possible. Please note that shorts are\nNOT\nallowed inside the Vatican.\nThe Sistine Chapel is included on the free day, St Peter's Basillica is also free to enter but there will be security queues.\nAdditionally, for those interested there may be the option of attending the\nSunday Angelus\nin St Peter's Square, starting at 12.30. Please note that this only takes place when the Pope is in residence at the Vatican.  I will check the schedule as this day gets closer.\nFor those that prefer to stay at the monastery you will need to ensure that you have all your daily supplies as the shops and stores in Tivoli will most likely be closed today. There is the option of visiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n, but cannot be booked until Spring 2026.\nDinner may be a cookout at the monastery or some restaurants may be open.\nMonday 27 July\nAnother early start will see us exploring this 11.5km\nPonte Nomentano\n\"linear\" loop along the Aniene River. This requires the use of public transport (50 minutes by bus each way) or private car to the start / end point and that will be advised upon during the event.\nThis walk is completely flat, along the banks of the Anien River.  Good trainers or walking shoes should be adequate, but bear in mind there may be mud if there has been any rain. There are several restuarants / cafes at the 6km turn-around point that might work for lunch; we will just need to see what is open.\nTuesday 28 July\nToday will see us venturing into Rome to explore this ancient city.  Independent options could include:\nRome \"hop on - hop off\" bus tour;\nTickets\nshould be purchased in advance, starting at €26 per person.\nExplore the city on your own, taking in sites like Vatican City, the\nColosseum\n(multiple ticket options, starting from €53) or the \"\nEat, Pray, Love\n\" movie\nfilming locations\ntour.\nExplore\nSt Peter's Basillica\n(free to enter but there will be long security queues)\nFor the foodies you can try and visit the 13 best\ngelaterias\nin Rome!\nExplore the\nJewish Ghetto\n, which actually dates back to 1555 when it was created by Pope Paul IV Carafa.\nBe the ultimate tourist and toss coins into the Trevi Fountain (one coin \"ensures\" your return to Rome, two coins increases your chances of finding true love in the near future, and three coins ensures coins 1 and 2, as well as ensuring marriage in the Eternal City - coins must be tossed over your right shoulder using your left hand), walk down the Spanish Steps, or stroll down the\nVia Condotti\n(Rome's luxury shopping street).\nPartake in any one of the free (only pay what you want)\nwalking tours\nof Rome.\nAs the streets are virtually all cobblestone, good, solid soled shoes are highly recommended. Dinner this evening will be a special event (paid individually), at a restaurant in Rome to be decided upon later.\nWednesday 29 July\nToday we venture \"uphill\" from the monastery, taking in this 12.8km\nSughereta di Sirividola\nloop. This hike starts just down the main road from the monastery so no transport is needed. This hike is mostly on mountain paths, with an elevation gain of 460 metres and a loss of 450 metres.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nAnother option, if you so desire, could be returning to Rome to attend the free\nPapal Audience\nin St Peter's Square.  Again this is obviously ties to the Holy Father's summer schedule.`\nDinner this evening can either be communal back at the monastery or at any of the local tavernas.\nThursday 30 July\nToday is our last full day in this incredible location so let's make the most of it! For those that are not too knackered from yesterday's hike, there is this 8.45km\nTivoli to Monte Catillo\nloop through the hills above Tivoli. This hike should be a bit less strenuous than yesterday's but still has an elevation gain of 330 metres, and a loss of the same.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nFor those not interested in hiking today, cultural options include:\nVisiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n. Please note that you cannot book tickets until Spring 2026.\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the village, following any one of these 3\nitineraries\n.\nCompletely spoil yourself at the\nAqua Albule\nthermal spa, about 20 minutes by train from Tivoli. Use of the pool is around €17; full access to the thermal spa is around €45 and includes use of the sauna, \"flavoured\" and \"sailing\" showers (don't ask as I have no idea!!!) and hydrotherapy. Please note that ODL accepts no responsibility for your use of these facilities.  As always you should check with your GP to see if these services are right for you.\nDinner tonight will be a communal affair at the monastery, with a special \"theme\" to be announced early in the week.\nFriday 31 July\nSadly, our Roman adventure comes to an end today.  We will need to check out of the monastery by 10.00am, before which we will do the traditional \"ODL hostel clean\".\nIf you are flying back to the UK today please try not to book your departing flight before 16.00, as it is at least 2 hours on the bus / train, including a change in Rome.\nIf you are staying on in Rome for any additional days, please do not book your transport from Tivoli before 11.00, in order for everyone to participate in the clean-up.\nRome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is served by virtually every major airport in the UK, using EasyJet, RyanAir, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling and WizzAir.  Rome Ciampino Airport (approximately 1 hour south of Rome) is served by RyanAir (from Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and London Stansted - please note that flight days can vary).\nShould you wish to arrive in Rome before the 24th, or stay after the 31st, please note that all costs will be your own to incur and you will not be able to stay on longer at the monastery.\nIt is strongly recommended that you secure travel insurance to cover not only the hiking activities, but also flight delay or cancellation, baggage delays, medical care and, if necessary, repatriation.\nPay in instalments\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. This is how the event leader has chosen to pay - so it's no hardship.\nExamples of instalment options, but we're happy to discuss options with you:\nBook during October: Eight payments of £64.50\nBook during November: Seven payments of £73.72\nBook during December: Six payments of £86.\nYou will need to have fully paid up by the start of June.\nPhotos:\nPhotos provided\nwww.unsplash.com\n, OutdoorLads members and the monastery and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.",

    "Summary": "EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE 2026 - 21-28 MARCH in Tignes\n***\nEuropean Snow Pride 2025 bookings open on the 8th September\n!! ***\nTo join the Sunday night social odl event\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/european-snow-pride-social-260322\nThis is EUROPE'S BIGGEST GAY FESTIVAL OF  WINTER SPORT & MUSIC with guests coming from all over Europe, North America and beyond.\nIt takes place in the gay friendly resort of TIGNES and in the snow sure and huge beautiful ski area of Tignes and Val D'Isere!\nEuropean Snow Pride features great apres ski on the slopes, with DJs, saxophone players, percussionists, singers and performers, Fantastic club parties including a giant pool party, a gay pride parade and much more.\nA unique opportunity to meet people from all around the world and make new friends!\nIf you have not attended one of these type of events before they are great fun. In the daytime there are guided groups that you can join for skiing or snowboarding where you will meet lots of other gay guys, and rendezvous restaurants where multiple groups meet for lunch. In the evening there are parties every nite some are themed (fancy dress) and are great fun. In between there is apres ski at the end of the day and the spa (if you have access) .\nFor more info:-\nEuropean Snow Pride website\n.\nEuropean Snow Pride on facebook\n.\nPLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO EUROPEAN SKIING EVENTS THIS ONE, (EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE ESP) AND EUROPEAN GAY SKI WEEK  EGSW SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNING UP TO THE ONE YOU WANT TO ATTEND , ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE BOOKED ON ONE. THIS EVENT IS FOR EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE in TIGNES\nThere is a WhatsApp group to assist people in communicating to book / share accommodation and to communicate and arrange to meet up whilst there. See the link in the location information below to join.\nPlease read the info on here carefully and on the ESP website, feel free to ask questions on the comments section below or in the whatsapp group.\nACCOMMODATION\nThere are lots of options see the\nEuropean Snow Pride website\nfor details.\nWhen booking for accommodation is open. I recommend booking ASAP as the best accommodation offers sell out early and the cost increases a little every month !\nThere are standard accommodation options that are eligible for the outdoorlads discount (\n€35 pp for non special offer accom booked with an Event Pass+6 day lift pass see\nODL Discount\n.), and there are the special offer accoms ranging from approx £400 to £700 these are already really good value so they are not discounted.\nYou will need to pay 25% on booking and the remainder 1 month before the event.\nI will be booking the deluxe special offer (£764pp (increases monthly)), a lot of the outdoorlads book this as is really good value and it makes shareing with other outdoorlads simple. The apartments are great, it is close to the slopes and it has access to the fantastic spa. This includes both event and lift passes. So just flights, transfers and spending money on top.\nThe apartments are for 5 people but you don't need to arrange who you are sharing with till later so I recommend booking to secure a place as this will sell out. (There are lots of other options and the non special offer accom is eligible for discount). If you are on a tight budget the standard special is great value at £500.\nIf you have got your own group together then great , if not message on the WhatsApp group , see link in the location information below to join the group, ask if any other outdoorlads are looking to share. With the special offer accom , snowpride will allocate you an apartment with others you request to share with and/or will fill spaces with others on snowpride. I have shared with others i didn't know in the past and found it a great way to make new friends.\nSKIING/SNOWBOARDING\nThere are daily guided groups for intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders and ski school available for beginners. This year each guided group will be accompanied by an ESP promoter and a professional ski guide from evolution 2.\nEuropean Snow Pride Ski options\n.\nYou can hire  your equipment  from ESP also.\nEVENT PASS ETC\nTo participate in the ski groups, a client must either purchase an Event Pass Premium, or an Event Pass Standard plus a supplement for ski and snowboard groups.\nThe standard includes the evening parties but not the daytime guided ski groups or the pool party.\nThis makes it more flexible so that if you do not use the guided ski groups or go to the pool party it will be cheaper for you. You can add the pool party or the guided groups to the Standard pass as an optional extra.\nIf you are intending to do the guided ski groups and pool party then it is more cost effective to get the premium.\nFull details on the types of event pass here;:\nhttps://www.europeansnowpride.com/fr/pass-evenement-gay-ski-week/\nGETTING THERE\nYou need to organise your own transport .\nSee\nEuropean Snow Pride travel options\n.\nWhen booking flights to the resort the transfers usually leave the airports before 3pm on Saturday and are not likely to arrive back at the airport until after 3pm on the return journey. So please bear this in mind when booking flights. (As in, early flight on arrival and late flight on return. There have been many occasions with a late return transfer as Saturday is change over day for the whole of the french alps! The traffic is usually extremely congested, do not be misled by google travel times that are not for Saturday! Several people have missed flights booked too early in the day.)\n(ESP photos copyright Franck Weens\nwww.weens.fr\nand Andréa Emmanuelli - Lezak\nwww.andrew-grey.com\nand European Snow Pride)",

Therefore, we recommend only registering for this walk if you can walk the same distance on a relatively flat terrain.\nThe Route\nThe route up to Ingleborough from Clapham is perhaps the finest and most scenic. We start in the picturesque village of Clapham, complete with a river running through the middle. From here we walk along good country tracks gently up through a woodland, and then drop down to the riverside as the valley gets narrower.\nWe follow this river until we meet some classic Yorkshire Dales limestone crags and head through a narrow gorge where there are small bolts drilled in for climbers. But you have to look closely!\nOnce through this dramatic gorge, we begin striking up toward Ingleborough on good tracks. Open farmland gives way to open moorland and we'll begin to see the summit of Ingleborough in the distance. The summit itself is a large wide plateau - once used as an Iron Age hill fort.\nOnce we've taken a picture or two of the group (and any views if we're not in the middle of a cloud), we'll retrace our steps back. On the return route though, we'll continue along the river all the way through the forest back into Clapham.\nPost-Walk Food\nIt's not part of the official trip, but we may see if we can stay on for a pub meal for those that want to. But we'll decide on the day!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but, like the owner, you must be certain your dog can do both the distance and the climb (up and down).\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nImage Credits:\nAll images taken by the event leaders with permission for ODL use.",
