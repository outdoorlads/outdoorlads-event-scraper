    "Summary": "Our route follows the winding Wear in places, and old railway lines in others. We pass a number of disused pits that have now been turned into a park and a nature reserve. There are stretches that are more suburban, and some roadside walking, but I have tried to keep this to a minimum. There is a little bit of ascent on this route (under 200 metres) and the route includes good surfaces in the main.\nThis walk starts at\nFinchale Priory\n, an English Heritage site. There will be time to visit the priory on our return, in case you wish to get your history fix.  We initially head towards Great Lumley. After around 1 1/2 hours of the walk, you will start to get some views of\nLumley Castle\n(sadly not home to Joanna!).  We skirt parts of the golf course, before getting a better view after passing through Lumley Thicks (woodlands).\nWe then follow a shaded path towards Bournmoor, and on to\nElba Park\n, where you can see an interesting sculpture commemorating the Wooden Wagonway. We pass close to Fence Houses, before continuing on to the\nRainton Meadows Nature Reserve\n.\nWe walk on and pass Leamside, before we take a short loop through Cocken Woods and reconnect with the River Wear, back to our starting point.\nAfter the walk, there will be an opportunity for a drink at The Three Horseshoes, before we head home.\nDogs: Well-behaved and under-control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request.\nIf this event is fully booked:\nPlease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event:\nIf this is your first event, we’ll make sure you feel welcomed. Please\ncheck out the My First Event page\n, and don’t hesitate to drop me a message if you have questions or want to know more about this walk.\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nAbsolutely!\nFor bouldering there is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help to show you around and give you tips on bouldering techniques\nFor rope climbing, we welcome all abilities however before you are able to climb at the centre unsupervised, you will need to pass the centre's climbing test. But don't let that put you off as our leader will be happy to offer you a supervised climbing session in which you will have the opportunity to do some rope climbing, as well as to learn some rope and belay technique to help you on your way to passing the centre's test.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nAbsolutely!\nFor bouldering there is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help to show you around and give you tips on bouldering techniques\nFor rope climbing, we welcome all abilities however before you are able to climb at the centre unsupervised, you will need to pass the centre's climbing test. But don't let that put you off as our leader will be happy to offer you a supervised climbing session in which you will have the opportunity to do some rope climbing, as well as to learn some rope and belay technique to help you on your way to passing the centre's test.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nAbsolutely!\nFor bouldering there is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help to show you around and give you tips on bouldering techniques\nFor rope climbing, we welcome all abilities however before you are able to climb at the centre unsupervised, you will need to pass the centre's climbing test. But don't let that put you off as our leader will be happy to offer you a supervised climbing session in which you will have the opportunity to do some rope climbing, as well as to learn some rope and belay technique to help you on your way to passing the centre's test.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge.

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIt is essential that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nEvery person participating should be aware of & accept that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified & are not regarded by Outdoorlads, or themselves, as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience & who are happy to impart their knowledge.

    "Summary": "A November social visiting many of the brilliant bars across the city centre\nThe evening chosen is when there is no home game for Newcastle FC so town should be busy but not rammed.\nStarting off at Number 28 a cool hidden gem above a bookies at the Grainger Market staying here for around an hour. This is a totally uniqie venue, quirky, arty and has a good cocktail menu. There are many tables here so there should be seats available at this earlier time..\nThen a hike down to the Town Wall in Pink Lane. This is a popular meet up spot, a larger bar area in the centre and tables in many side rooms with a traditional feel and a great selection of ales.\nAfter a drink here we will head to the Bridge Tavern. Tucked underneath the Tyne Bridge. This has a long bar on the groundfloor with a terrace with patio heaters above. This venue offers a huge selection of drinks, plays great music and has a very much friendly welcoming vibe.  Please note this is the one at the bottom of Dene Street and not to be mixed up with Bridge Hotel. This has a microbrewery on site so try a new very locally brewed pint.\nOnward we move a short distance to where we can get pie, peas and mash at Redhouse. You pay at bar, the food is superb stodge and it means no one has to divide the bill or pay a deposit. The pub is traditional, dark wood, exposed beams, a frontage that nods to the history.\nIf you prefer there is Sambucas over the road for pizza.\nWe can then go to The Dubliner nearby for live music.\nAfter that the scene is a short trek away for those that want to end the night there.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photograph images on this page were provided by the leader Steve and permission is kindly given for OutdoorLads to use.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Have you ever felt like you just want to burst but couldn't quite do it?  That's just how Earl felt 650 million years ago. Huge quantities of hot gooey stuff upwelled in Earl but, instead of bursting, oozed out and down the hillside. Hillside, because Earl is a hill, also known as\nPontesbury volcano\n!\nHopefully there won't be any eruptions on our walk, but the remains of Shropshire's volcanic past will be evident. This walk takes us to the top of\nEarl's Hill\nwith it's stupendous views across the flat Shropshire countryside to the North. Before that, we view an old quarry with it's hardened deposits, now a haven for particular wildlife and flora. Here, bats, badgers, peregrine falcon, polecat, grayling butterfly and spotted flycatcher have made their homes. Common spotted orchid is in abundance on the quarry floor.\nWe will take time to explore\nSnailbeach\nand stop for lunch break here.\nThe volcanos left rich mineral deposits including lead and zinc, which were mined, and mines trails may not be explored. Mining started in Roman times, according to some remains, and continued into the 1950s, since when the remains slowly declined. Much remains unchanged from this time and may be explored at surface level.\nA dramatic, triangular hill fort is discernible 1km to the south. We may walk up to the ramparts and back, so you can miss this if you wish to spend more time looking at Snailbeach. This was almost impenetrable except for one side gate, perched on an outcrop at the northern end of the\nStiperstones\n. The size was staggering, with 8 metre ramparts and 5 metre ditches, suitable for a most powerful iron age warlord.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nA public transport accessible 12.1 mile circular hike in the Chiltern Hills from Princes Risborough railway station, with direct train services to and from London Marylebone, High Wycombe and Oxford and connections from Banbury, Leamington Spa and Birmingham.\nA summary of some of the sights:\nBledlow\nis a historic village in Buckinghamshire. Mentioned in the Domesday Book, it is noted for its 12th-century Holy Trinity Church, the Lyde springs and gardens, and the nearby Bledlow Cross.\nThe\nLyde Garden\nin Bledlow is a sunken water garden created in the 1980s from former watercress beds on the Carrington Estate. Fed by natural springs at the source of the River Lyde, it features pools, waterfalls, and lush planting of primulas, gunnera, ferns, and hostas, set in a shaded ravine with a tranquil, almost Oriental character. It's regarded as a hidden gem for peaceful walks and reflection and free to visit. I will plan a short interval to allow a visit.\nChinnor Hill\nis a nature reserve in the Chiltern Hills, managed by the Berks, Bucks & Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT). It offers sweeping views over the Vale of Aylesbury and Oxfordshire, with a mix of chalk grassland, ancient woodland, and scrub that supports rare wildflowers, butterflies, and birds and is a popular spot for walking and wildlife watching.\nRadnage\nis a small, rural village in the Chiltern Hills. Its parish church, St Mary the Virgin, dates from the 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. It retains fine medieval wall paintings, a Norman font, and later additions, making it a notable example of a simple country church with significant historic character.\nThe Ridgeway\nis a prehistoric track along the Chilterns and Wessex Downs, known as Britain’s oldest road.\nThe\nIcknield Way\nis an ancient east–west route across chalk uplands, linking Norfolk to Wiltshire.\nThe route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Princes Risborough Railway station, we will initially head via a flat route of paths and lanes to the small hamlet of Horsenden and later to Bledlow, which is an attractive village with a fine church and pub. We will stop briefly to give people the option to look at the Lyde Garden (see description above).\nFrom Bledlow the walk really begins in earnest as we take the long climb up towards Bledlow Cross, through the Great Wood, eventually to arrive at the nature reserve of Chinnor Hill, where we can take a break to admire the views (weather permitting!!) over Aylesbury Vale. We then continue on paths and lanes with more ups and downs and plenty of beech woodland to Sprigs Alley and after the final down section we walk for some time along a valley (Collier's Lane) which marks the border of Oxfordshire and Bucks and was used by travellers in the past to avoid road tolls until the system of taxing vehicles rather than roads was introduced. Somewhere in this area we will have  break for lunch.\nAfter lunch we will traverse through the hamlet of Bennett's End and onto Radnage which has a fine church (see more details above), and some may wish to visit. There is another climb out of Radnage but the reward of a pub (The Boot at Bledlow Ridge) at the top where we can stop for a drink. The final stretch of the walk continues to be undulating but as we head back towards Princes Risborough it's more down than up!\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Alex for this 10.5-mile autumnal and arboreal amble around Hatfield Forest via Little and Great Hallingbury.\nWe will meet at the main western entrance to Bishop's Stortford station and initially head southwards following the languid waters of the River Stort, which forms much of the border between Hertfordshire and Essex. After crossing at a lock we will veer away from the river and towards the village of Little Hallingbury, before heading eastwards across open countryside.\nWe will cross Woodside Green and Wall Wood before entering Hatfield Forest, established in 1100 by Henry I as a royal hunting forest. Walking broadly northeast, we head across a landscape designed by Capability Brown in the 18th century for the Houbon family, the owners of the forest at the time. We will stop here for lunch next to the lake and Shell House, built from a combination of flint and shells from around the world.\nAfter lunch we will turn back westwards through the forest, closely following the flight path from Stansted airport, towards the pretty village of Great Hallingbury. Passing via the churchyard of the parish church of St Giles, we will walk back towards Bishop's Stortford where we will part ways for the station, the car park and/or the pub.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "It’s back! The annual circular walk starting and finishing at Windsor and Eton Riverside Station, following the River Thames to Runnymede, where we will visit the monuments commemorating the Magna Carta and uphill at Cooper’s Hill to the Air Forces Memorial Chapel. We’ll then follow the roads to Windsor Great Park, and enjoy the Park via the statue of George III and the Long Walk back into Windsor with optional pub stop at the end of the walk.\nThis route does not include Windsor Castle, but does include the Runnymede Monuments (free entry).\nDogs/dog owners will need to wait outside the grounds of the Air Forces Memorial whilst we visit (about 20 minutes).\nThe sights:\nThames Path:\nThe path is 185 miles from source to Woolwich, and we’ll enjoy the stretch out of Windsor along the serpentine river passing Home Park (home of royalty, esteemed or otherwise), the village of Datchet and on to Runnymede.\nRunnymede:\nThe sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the birthplace of democracy are marked by a number of monuments, which we will visit. These monuments include modern art at the Jurors, which include scenes commerating the fight for freedom and equal rights (including Harvey Milk), American memorials to JFK and the rule of law, and the 2018 installation at Writ in Water (is it a bunker or public convenience from the outside?!). More detail here:\nhttps://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/surrey/runnymede-and-ankerwycke\n. You can also listen to the audio tour here:\nhttps://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/surrey/runnymede-and-ankerwycke/…\nAir Forces Memorial:\nAtop Cooper’s Hill, the Memorial commemorates 20,000 men and women lost during the Second World War, and has a viewing platform which affords wide views over Surrey, the River Thames, past Heathrow and to London.\nWindsor Great Park:\nThe Crown Estate at Windsor stretches for 15,800 acres. We will visit the Great Park, perhaps spotting the resident deer and stopping at the equestrian Copper Horse statue erected in 1831 to King George III as a Roman Emperor. This marks one end of the Long Walk, created in 1682-5, and leads us to Windsor Castle almost 2.5 miles away. The Walk has been the setting of many royal events, most recently the carriage ride route for the wedding of Harry and Meghan (that fairytale seems a long long time ago), and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe route\n-\nplease click the link\nhttps://explore.osmaps.com/route/16784027/windsor-thames-path-and-runny…\nto see the route at the Ordnance Survey website\nThe start of the walk is at Windsor and Eton Riverside station, and we will almost immediately follow the Thames Path out of Windsor, passing Home Park and along the Thames. We’ll cross the river twice over busy bridges and pass Datchet at the riverside.\nA late lunch will be at Runnymede, where there is a small tea room. After time to visit the monuments, we’ll climb through the woods at Cooper’s Hill to the Air Forces Memorial, also stopping for a visit. We will follow pavements and woodland paths to Bishopsgate, to enter Windsor Great Park.\nThe views open up to Windsor and the north, and the going is easy over parkland and park roads with little traffic to Snow Hill. After stopping at King George III’s monument, it is a “straight” route of 2.5 miles along the Long Walk to Windsor.\nWe’ll pass Windsor town where there will be an optional pub stop at the end of the walk just before the station or you may wish to explore the town.\nDon't waste that space!\nSummer walks get really busy so please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs\nI love having dogs on my walks. There are busy roads to cross, and extensive pavements along busy roads, so your dog will need to be on a lead. Your dog must be on lead in the Park where there are deer.\nThe grounds and interior of the Air Forces Memorial do NOT allow dogs, so you will need to wait for around 20 minutes\nwhen the rest of the group explore.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Please join me for this linear walk along the Itchen Way from Bishopstoke to Winchester.\nIt's an easy and flat 7.8 mile (12.5km) walk along the Itchen river that is famous for its chalk base. A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its range of habitats that protect species such as water voles, otters and southern damselfly. Much of it will be following the Itchen Navigation, which is a disused canal completed in 1710 to act as a trading route between Winchester and the sea at Southampton. This trading route was integral to link up the two cities and was used for around 150 years. Today, many people enjoy the delights on this walk throughout the year, and I hope you will join me on a walk I have enjoyed multiple times over.\nWe will start at Eastleigh and walk along the Itchen Way to Shawford where we can pause at The Bridge Inn for a drink or just to take a breath. This section should take just under 3 hours.\nNext, we continue along the Itchen Way, past Twyford Lock and onto Winchester, with (hopefully) stunning views of St Catherine's Hill before descending into Winchester itself. This part is about 3 miles, so should take between 45 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes, so is slightly shorter than the first half of the day.\nOnce we reach Winchester the walk ends, but you are welcome to join me in The Black Boy pub for a drink, look around Winchester or take the train/bus home at your own convenience.\nI walked this route last year, but its such a lovely route to walk all seasons, I thought it was about time I walk it again. I hope you'll join me.\nDogs are welcome on my walk, but please have them under control. At some points the path is quite narrow and you may need to step aside should anyone else be passing, and walk in single file. Be prepared you may need to call you dog to heel on occasion. From what I can find on dog friendly websites, rather than hearsay, they should be welcome in both pubs mentioned, but please do feel free to check with the pubs yourselves.\nPhotographs\nCopyright: Itchen Nav Old Weir, 2007, Pedro near Bishopstoke\nItchen Way, 2014, Darrell Grundy, multicolouredplanet.com\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "If you've never or seldom been on a mountain walk but really wanted to, this is the walk for you!\nJoin Fabian and Lee for a 9 mile (14.4 km) walk up Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales.\nAimed at the novice mountain walker, we will go at a pace that suits the slowest members of the group. Having said that, even though this is a beginners mountain walk, you will still have to have a minumum level of fitness required. Therefore, we recommend only registering for this walk if you can walk the same distance on a relatively flat terrain.\nThe Route\nThe route up to Ingleborough from Clapham is perhaps the finest and most scenic. We start in the picturesque village of Clapham, complete with a river running through the middle. From here we walk along good country tracks gently up through a woodland, and then drop down to the riverside as the valley gets narrower.\nWe follow this river until we meet some classic Yorkshire Dales limestone crags and head through a narrow gorge where there are small bolts drilled in for climbers. But you have to look closely!\nOnce through this dramatic gorge, we begin striking up toward Ingleborough on good tracks. Open farmland gives way to open moorland and we'll begin to see the summit of Ingleborough in the distance. The summit itself is a large wide plateau - once used as an Iron Age hill fort.\nOnce we've taken a picture or two of the group (and any views if we're not in the middle of a cloud), we'll retrace our steps back. On the return route though, we'll continue along the river all the way through the forest back into Clapham.\nPost-Walk Food\nIt's not part of the official trip, but we may see if we can stay on for a pub meal for those that want to. But we'll decide on the day!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but, like the owner, you must be certain your dog can do both the distance and the climb (up and down).\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised and will need to book onto a future beginners event.  If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This walk covers beautiful chalk valleys, clear streams and gentle ridges with excellent views across rolling farmland. The land is made of chalk and clay, with rounded pebbles and puddingstones found locally. The topography and drainage is mostly dry and there are few streams in the area due to the porous chalk subsoil. The name of one village, 'Ashridge' (in which we could stop for a drink at\nThe Blue Ball Inn\n) derives from the Saxon ‘Essleie’ meaning 'ash ridge' and refers to the large expanse of forest that once covered this part of the Chilterns. The name of another, 'Chartridge' derives from the Saxon ‘Caerda’s Ridge’ and is one of the ancient hamlets of Chesham. The area around nowadays has more poppy fields and organic farms.\nThe area is rich in historical incident: prehistoric evidence includes a Palaeolithic handaxe and a Bronze Age sword; White Hawridge Bottom has evidence of strip lynchets built around the 11th century (lynchets are the result of ploughing accumulating earth on the lowest point of the slope and building up a terrace of flatter ground on a square or rectangle); Pednor House was a Tudor manor house, extensively reworked over the centuries and given an Arts & Crafts makeover; Herbert's Hole is the name of a shallow valley, possibly meaning an overnight resting place for drovers; Lowndes Park surrounding The Bury was the home of William Lowndes, the mean-minded treasurer of William III and Queen Anne (the phase 'Look after the pence, and the pounds will look after themselves' is attributed to him, and incidentally, both monarchs have been alleged to have had same-sex relationships); Chesham was a centre for the suffragette campaign, with Mrs Emily Brandon leading the way; and the sleepy town actually played a part in the history of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) (read more\nhere\n).\nAll the ridges add up to 500m of ascent, and so this walk qualifies as an entry in the 'SE500' series of walks; if you attend you'll improve your fitness and burn 2100 calories in the process. This walk will be fairly challenging, but we'll take it at a sensible pace and in manageable stages and we'll do each rise with plenty of time to have rests.\nThe\nroute\ninvolves rolling hills, ridges and fields and is suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. There could be mud if the early autumn has been wet.\nWe'll rise over the ancient cultivation terraces to just below Dungrove Farm and descend to the River Chess, then rise again through paths across fields to Tyler’s Hill Ridge (ridge #1: 170m up). We'll cross fields and woods to Hawkridge Court Ridge (ridge #2: 168m up), a likely lunch spot. We'll descend to White Hawkridge Bottom by the ostrich farm, cross the wooded Valley to Bellingdon Ridge (ridge #3: 171m up) and cross the next valley and up to Asheridge (ridge #4: 172m up). We'll then traverse the double-headed valley to Chartridge (ridge #5: 172m up). We'll go through Pednor Bottom to top out at a manor house, Pednor House Ridge (ridge #6: 176m up). We'll then go down Herbert’s Hole valley through woods and on to Hundridge (ridge #7: 155m up). We'll descend back into Chesham along Blind Lane (an ancient packhorse trail) and enter Lowndes Park and go over a hump. After toilet stop we'll go back to the station.

    "Summary": "I sometimes have more than thirty attendees on my walks, but I will limit the numbers on this walk to thirty to make it manageable in a busy urban setting. If you're among the first few on the wait list, you should still get a place once folk start cancelling.\nWith 2000 years of history (sextons found Roman remains digging graves in St George's Cemetery), five centuries of architectural innovation, around ten architectural styles, and a reputation for radical, intellectual, affluential and regal characters, Bloomsbury is a fascinating area in London's West End. The architectural diversity has jeopardised the area's essential character, with modern and brutalist designs being built not just on bombsites but where Georgian and Victorian buildings were wilfully demolished, but despite this, the district is still known for its numerous elegant Georgian garden squares, and the brutalist intrusions have improved with age or now seem democratic.\nBloomsbury timeline:\nC1-C4:\nRoman remains show settlement near Londinium.\nC12:\nName 'Blemondisberi' appears, after William de Blemond was given land by William the Conqueror.\nC13:\nEstate passes to Carthusian monks.\n1530s:\nHenry VIII grants the abbey and its land to the Earl of Southampton.\n1660s:\nBloomsbury begins urban development; Bloomsbury Square laid out.\n1753-1759:\nBritish Museum founded and opens in Montagu House.\n1775–1783:\nBedford Square constructed by Thomas Leverton for the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford.\n1800–1804:\nRussell Square designed by Humphry Repton; Tavistock, Gordon and Woburn Squares follow.\n1823–1852:\nCurrent British Museum building constructed.\n1828-1836:\nUniversity College London and University of London established.\nEarly C20:\nBloomsbury Group meets in Gordon and Tavistock Squares.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll meet outside our first sight, which is...\n1. Russell Square Underground Station\n: Architect Leslie Green, built 1906. Distinctive oxblood-red terracotta façade, iconic of early Underground stations on the Piccadilly Line.\nWe'll then go west along Bernard Street and south down Russell Square to...\n2. Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel:\nOriginally the Hotel Russell, by Charles Fitzroy Doll, built 1898. Lavish terracotta building in French Renaissance style. The four queens sculptures are noteworthy. It is said to have inspired the interiors aboard the\nTitanic\n.\nWe'll then walk around...\n3. Russell Square Gardens:\nLandscaped by Humphry Repton for the Duke of Bedford in 1804. One of London’s largest squares, with fine plane trees and fountains, although some newer buildings (such as the UCL School of Education and the Imperial Hotel, which is being refurbished) have intruded.\nWe'll then walk south down Montague Street, west along Great Russell Street and south down Museum Street to the A40 and...\n4. Church of St George, Bloomsbury:\nBy Nicholas Hawksmoor, built 1716–31. Eccentric stepped tower or ziggurat topped with a statue of George I as a Roman emperor. Considered one of Hawksmoor’s finest Baroque works. Dramatic and wayward, elephantine at street level, and increasingly delicate as it ascends.\nWe'll then walk east along the A40 to...\n5. Bloomsbury Square Gardens:\nLondon’s oldest surviving garden square, laid out in the 1660s. Once fronted Southampton House, a Jacobean mansion that gave Bloomsbury its aristocratic roots.\nWe'll then walk east along Theobalds Road and north up Boswell Street to...\n6. Great Ormond Street Hospital\n: Britain’s first dedicated children’s hospital, founded by Dr Charles West in 1852. J M Barrie donated the rights to\nPeter Pan\nto it in 1929, funding the hospital in perpetuity.\nWe'll then walk east along Great Ormand Street to...\n7. Lamb’s Conduit Street:\nNamed after William Lambe, who funded a conduit here in 1577 to bring fresh water to Holborn, so a rare Elizabethan survival in Bloomsbury’s urban memory. Today has lively independent shops and cafés.\nAnd then to Millman Street for...\n8. Rugby Tavern:\nA rare survival of a historic pub on Great James Street, dating to the C18. Named for Rugby School, which once owned the land here.\nWe'll walk north up Millman Street, and west along Guilford Street to the...\n9. Site of the Foundling Hospital:\nSet up by Thomas Coram, a retired shipwright and sea captain was so moved by the plight of children abandoned starving in the streets that he campaigned for 17 years start a foundling hospital. Many of rank and nobility supported it, including Thomas Gainsborough, William Hogarth and Georg Frederic Handel. It was the first purpose-built children’s charity hospital in Britain (1739). We'll see the spot where the children of destitute mothers would be abandoned into the care of the hospital. The hospital was demolished in the 1920s, but some of its interiors survive. The Coram Foundation Playing Fields are unique in that adults using them must be accompanied by a child rather than vice-versa.\nWe'll go north across Brunswick Square to the...\n10. Foundling Hospital Museum:\nThe building dates from 1935-7 to house the collections and interiors from the demolished Foundling Hospital. It contains many works of art from patrons such as Gainsborough and Hogarth. Some of the most moving objects are the tokens - coins, buttons, jewellery and poems – left by mothers with their babies on admission, enabling the Foundling Hospital to match a mother with her child should she ever return to claim it. The overwhelming majority of the children weren't, and the tokens are in the care of the museum. The adjacent sculpture of Coram is by William Macmillan from 1963.\nGoing back on ourselves west to Hunter Street, we'll turn east down Handel Street to...\n11. St George’s Gardens:\nLaid out as a burial ground for St George’s Bloomsbury and St George’s Hanover Square, and a rare survival in that it is unchanged. Atmospheric Georgian garden cemetery. Contains the grave of Anna Cromwell, granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\nGoing back down Handel street, westwards, we'll enter the...\n12. Brunswick Centre:\nDesigned by Patrick Hodgkinson from 1966 to 1971. Brutalist 'streets in the sky' development, now Grade II-listed. There's a Waitrose here in which you could get lunch.\nLeaving the Brunswick Centre, we'll be on Marchmont Street, which we'll head north along to find...\n13. 57 Marchmont Street:\nChildhood flat of comic actor and diarist Kenneth Williams, above his father’s barber shop. Marchmont Street retains much of its C19 shopfront character.\nWe'll then walk west down Coram Street and south down Herbrand Street to get to the...\n14. Daimler Garage, Herbrand Street:\nFormer Daimler Car Hire Garage, by Wallis, Gilbert & Partners, built in 1931. Bold and suave Art Deco design with faience cladding.\nWe'll then go north back up Herbrand Street to Tavistock Place to see...\n15. Mary Ward House:\nA lovely Arts and Crafts design from 1897 by Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Claude Brewer. The Mary Ward foundation supports education, social reform, and community activities. Its architecture features handcrafted brickwork and masonry. Mary Ward worked to improve education and representation for the poor, but was a staunch opponent of giving women the right to vote, and in 1908 she became the founding President of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League.\nWestwards around the corner is...\n16. Tavistock Square:\nPart of Bloomsbury’s grid of Georgian terraces. Leads towards Tavistock Square, long associated with writers and reformers. The headquarters of the British medical Association is on the Square. We'll have lunch here in the gardens (or in the Pret opposite). The bronze bust of Virginia Woolf is a casting of Stephen Tomlin’s original 1931 sculpture from 2004. The statue of Mahatma Gandhi - depicting him in a meditative lotus position - is by Fredda Brilliant, unveiled in 1968\nWe'll then head further west to...\n17. Gordon Square:\nBuilt in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt as part of the Bedford Estate’s expansion. Its residents gave the Bloomsbury Group its name. Virginia Woolf lived at no. 46, Lytton Strachey, essayist and biographer, also lived in the square as did the economist John Maynard Keynes and the author E.M. Forster. Other intellectuals regularly visited.\nAnd see at the corner of the square...\n18. Church of Christ the King:\nDesigned by Raphael Brandon in a Gothic-revival style, chiefly Early English. Now home to various Christian communities but under the Catholic Apostolic Church. Incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a façade), and the spire and full height of its tower are missing. We'll have time to explore.\nWe'll go up Gordon Street, then west along Gower Place, then south down Gower Street to...\n19. University College London:\nBy William Wilkins from 1826–30 who also designed the National Gallery. The neoclassical dome and portico (akin to his design for the National Gallery) were a symbol of progressive, secular education. It was the first English university to admit students regardless of religion, the first in the world to admit women, and the first to have an LGB society (thanks go to Steve Rowett for this information).\nWe'll then turn east along Torrington Place then south down Malet Street to...\n20. Senate House:\nBy Charles Holden (1937), soaring Art Deco limestone tower. Served as the Ministry of Information in WWII and famously inspired Orwell’s 'Ministry of Truth' in\n1984\n. It became 'Stuyvesant Towers' in New York, the location for Bertie Wooster's New York apartment in the ITV\nJeeves and Wooster\n. It is unlikely that Hitler personally wanted Senate House to be his headquarters in the event of Operation Sealion being successful, but being imposing and defensible it was identified by Nazi planners as a suitable headquarters for the German occupation government.\nWe'll continue down Malet Street to Montagu Place, then go west along it to...\n21. Bedford Square:\nThe most complete surviving Georgian square in London from 1770s. Uniform terraces, once fashionable residences, now mostly academic offices. 'Bedford Square' local lad Kenneth Williams enthused '...really is what Bloomsbury in its heyday was all about. Lovely rows of Georgian houses surrounding a garden. The garden itself providing an oasis against all the hubbub of urban life and aesthetically pleasing too.'\nAfter going round that, we'll head south along Bloomsbury Street to Great Russell Street and the...\n22. British Museum:\nBy Sir Robert Smirke, 1823-1852. The Greek Revival design is monumental and famous, but rigid. The collections inside are vast, diverse and iconic, yet often criticized for colonial acquisitions and a lack of contextual interpretation. Ian Nairn wrote in\nNairn's London,\n'Smirke was under the impression that architecture could be created by wrapping and great number of ionic columns around a big E shaped mass. It is putting together a building from the outside, instead of designing it from a central idea, and it never comes alive for a moment’. You'll get most of the afternoon to browse the museum if you want.\n(Picture credits: British Museum from the NE:\nPhoto\n©\nHam\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); Pediment, The British Museum:\nPhoto\n©\nPhilip Halling\n(cc-by-sa/2.0); Russell Square station, Bernard Street:\nPhoto\n©\nBryn Holmes\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bedford Square by Jeremysm (Public Domain); Hotel Russell, Russell Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Sones\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The cafe in Russell Square:\nPhoto\n©\nRod Allday\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Former Daimler Garage, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nSteve Cadman\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Mary Ward House, Tavistock Place, WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Quinn\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Senate House, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of Christ the King, Gordon Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Osley\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Wilkins Building:\nPhoto\n©\nDiliff\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); St George, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices. We ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive)\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.00*\n-     Hire a harness (again, if you don’t have your own) - £3.00*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for this pleasant 11 mile Sunday walk starting at the well-manicured Waterperry Gardens in Oxfordshire, just off the M40. We'll wander across the Oxon/Bucks border between lovely small villages located along and around the River Thame.\nThe Gardens were originally established as a school for horticulture in the 1930s, with Waterperry House standing since the 17th Century. The Gardens are beautifully kept and well worth a visit, especially in the spring for the snowdrops. There is a small rural life museum, garden centre and tea room attached, but sadly the old farm shop has now gone. There is also an outdoor amphitheatre where they hold opera events. The Waterperry estate apparently used to supply strawberries to Buckingham Palace back in the day!\nWe will walk through the village of Waterperry and make a circuit over the M40 and back again towards Worminghall, and then to Ickford. We then get to Shabbington where we can stop for lunch by the river at the Old Fisherman pub.\nWe will then follow the river course south following the Thame Valley footpath and then we will make a detour to see the Chapel at Rycote, standing since the 15th Century. There is a charge of £8 to go inside the chapel (with some concessions\nhttps://www.rycotepark.com/rycote-chapel-tours-and-opening-times/)\nbut it's impressive enough from the outside also.\nWe will then take the return path back through Albury, Tiddington and Waterstock back to the start. If we get back early enough there might be tea and scones on the lawn, or you may be able to go in and see the gardens for yourself (open until 5.30).\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome to come along but be mindful not everyone likes dogs as much as you might. They will need to be on the lead when we are within the Waterperry estate and at the Rycote Chapel. There are short bits of walking on roads and a few very busy road crossings to be mindful of.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A short stroll out of historic Farnham soon trades cobbled charm for a patchwork of green commons, sandy tracks, and wide water meadows. The River Wey meanders lazily between reed beds, mirroring willows that lean in as if to gossip. Old bridges, neat cricket greens, and clusters of cottages give this walk a gentle, timeless feel — but there’s a dash of variety too, with stretches of heathland, quiet woodland, and open pasture.\nThis will be the lovely\nFelipe Rogatto\n's assessment walk as he ventures to become a Lowland and Hill Walk leader for OutdoorLads. Your support for Felipe is sought.\nThe sights:\nFarnham:\nA handsome Georgian market town with a medieval street plan. Known for its 12th-century castle, built by the Bishop of Winchester, and its elegant shopfronts along Castle Street. The town’s name means “ferny homestead” — an apt start point for a leafy walk.\nThe River Wey:\nOne of southern England’s prettiest rivers, the Wey here flows through low meadows that flood in winter and shimmer with dragonflies in summer. Look out for grey wagtails, herons, and the occasional kingfisher.\nTilford:\nPicture-postcard Surrey. Two greens, two medieval bridges, and one very fine pub. Tilford cricket matches are played on the upper green, with spectators often enjoying a pint at The Barley Mow across the road. The lower green is framed by the twin arches of the 12th-century bridge over the Wey.\nWey Valley Meadows:\nThese protected pastures host wildflowers in spring, including buttercups, cuckooflower, and southern marsh orchids. In summer, swallows skim low over the grass, snatching insects on the wing.\nDogs:\nThis walk is very suitable for dogs. There’s plenty of open space, river access for a drink or paddle, and several fields with livestock (dogs on leads in these areas, please).\nThe\nroute\n(click the link in red to see the route along with the elevation):\nStarting from Farnham Station, we’ll head South and follow field paths and sandy lanes to reach Tilford’s upper green. We’ll stop here for lunch, and get a drink at The Barley Mow. After lunch, we’ll loop back via the lower green and its medieval bridge, rejoining the Wey path toward Farnham. The route is about 17 km (10.5 miles) with some gentle undulations.\nThis is a circular walk returning to Farnham Station, with frequent trains to Guildford and London Waterloo.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It's got a large dining / social area with a log burner stove, a decent kitchen, plenty of toilets and hot showers and a great plus- small rooms and no massive dormitory set ups.\nGiven its location in the Lake District it is highly likely the Saturday full day walk on offer with be a mountain one, so plan accordingly. - we are already at a good altitude, but that doesn't mean we are cheating in any way.  Johnny will aim to lead a walk from the hostel, probably taking in Haystacks (Wainwright's favourite!). This of course is only a suggestion as there are almost  too many to choose from. For those looking for a more gentle weekend, there may be a lowland walk available or you are free to do your own things, such as visiting the slate mines next door, or take a short drive to nearby Buttermere, Borrowdale or Keswick. There is even a via ferrata on our doorstep- but that is absolutely NOT part of the ODL weekend.\nThere are 6 parking spaces at the hostel (8 at a tight squeeze), but we can use the large National Trust car park right behind the hostel (free overnight, paid for non-National Trust Members / free for members during the day) - If you're a member, please bring your card and leave the hostel spaces for others!\nThere will be one dog on the event (the leader's). He's happy to be fussed and have tummy rubs- but please, no treats or scraps from your dinners.\nPhotos used with permission of the leader\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "At 1550ft above sea level, Skiddaw House is the highest hostel in Britain. It was built around 1829 as a 'Keeper's lodge' and grouse shooting base for George Wyndham, the third Earl of Egremont. The building was originally divided into two separate dwellings; one side for the gamekeeper and his family and the other for a shepherd's family. The Earl and his shooting parties also had a few rooms to stay in when they came to visit. In 1986 the two dwellings were converted into the hostel it is today.\nSkiddaw House operated as a youth hostel from 1987 until 2002, when it closed and began to fall into disrepair again. But with the help of the previous hostel manager, many volunteers and the Skiddaw House Foundation, the hostel was renovated and reopened in 2007. The building retains many original features, which combined with its interesting history and remote location make the hostel a unique place to stay.\nOne of the great features of Skiddaw House is its remote location, offering stunning views of the surrounding Lakeland fells. This venue is an OutdoorLads favourite and is truly special, right from the moment you park up you'll understand why this is so glorious!\nHowever, the remote nature of the hostel means it is lacking the mod cons we may be used to, such as heating. Don't panic, there are a number of open fires throughout the building which helps keep it warm, but the bedrooms do not have any heating. Full bedding of 15tog duvets and pillow are provided but some may prefer to pack their own sleeping bag. Boots are also not allowed to be worn inside so we recommend packing slippers too!\nItinerary\nFriday Afternoon/Evening -\nArrive at the car park for 2:30pm, meet the rest of the group and we will hike up to the hostel together, sharing the load of weekend food supply bags. Please have your head torch handy in case we start to lose the light!  Once we have arrived and found our beds, there will be a briefing and we'll have the usual OutdoorLads buffet so please bring something that can be shared between two people (doesn't need to be complicated).\n(\nImportant note: You need to plan to be there at 2:30pm as we will then hike in together. We won't have scope to come back for stragglers and there is no phone signal at the car park. If you know you won't be able to meet at 2:30pm, please message the event leader before you book to discuss any other possibilities.)\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast will be available.  The main activity will be mountain walks (how many options we can offer depends on how many other mountain leaders book on). With hits like Skiddaw and Blencathra on our doorstep there are excellent options all around.  However we are also looking at the possibility of an (optional) conservation project of some kind in conjunction with the new owners of Skiddaw - more information will follow on this if we are able to arrange something.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop your feet up and unwind from the days activities. We will be putting together a two course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.  While the hostel has a few, if you have a favourite travel size board/card game why not bring it?\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided once more then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am.  Once done we will take everything we brought back to the car park and then people might want to head home, into Keswick for an afternoon touristing, or if there is the demand there could be another walk offered.\nOther information\nBeds:\nThere are two double beds in the hostel (not in private rooms sorry!). Please let the leader know when you book if you are coming with a partner or friend you are happy to share a bed with, so that we can enable as many people as possible to join this weekend.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nSkiddaw House requires a 1 hour hike to access it from the car park. To ensure everyone arrives safely we ask that all attendees meet at the car park for 2:30pm Friday so that we can hike up together. You will need to carry everything you need for the weekend including food and drink, in one trip - so pack light!\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Title": "1066 Country: Battle to Westfield",
    "Date": "Saturday Oct 25 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "20",
    "Summary": "We’ll step off the train at Battle Railway Station into the mellow gold light and bonfire-scented air of a late-October morning. We'll join the 1066 Country Walk trail (see the entire route\nhere\n), heading north through gentle fields before entering Great Wood, a sprawling remnant of the ancient Wealden forest. Here, towering oaks and sweet chestnut will stand in a blaze of copper and amber, their leaves carpeting the paths, while nuthatches and squirrels busy themselves with the season’s bounty.\nThe trail will lead us through rolling countryside towards Westfield, a village with roots in the Domesday Book. St John’s Church, rebuilt in 1815 on medieval foundations, will stand at the heart of the village, its churchyard flanked by venerable yews. We may pause for lunch in a cosy tearoom or take the chance to visit the local pub, where the low beams and roaring hearth will offer a welcome refuge from the autumn air.\nAfter lunch, we’ll follow quieter lanes and footpaths back to Battle, where history rises from every cobbled street. Here, the Battle of Hastings changed the course of English history: local Anglo-Saxon rulers were replaced with Norman monarchy, feudalism and hierarchy were introduced, nascent women's rights were eliminated, governance and justice were reshaped, French language and culture influenced law, architecture, and language, the political orientation of England was directed towards the European core rather than Scandinavia, and the foundations were laid for a centralized, powerful, data-driven English state.\nOn the day of the walk, this paroxysm will have occurred almost 960 years ago, when on 14 October 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, defeated King Harold II in a brutal clash that lasted most of the day and led to the loss of around 6000 lives. Harold’s army, fighting with spears, swords and axes, advantageously held the high ground behind a shield wall. He momentarily lost control of them when, sensing victory, the Saxon army surged down the hill, abandoning the high ground and the shield wall. The Norman army rallied, and their archers and cavalry - the latter not encountered by Saxon armies before - massacred them. Legend says that Harold fell to an arrow in the eye, a fate depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry. Legend also says that his body was so vengefully mutilated that only his wife, Edith Swan-Neck, could identify it by way of secret marks on his body known only to her.\nThe imposing Battle Abbey, founded by William in 1070 to celebrate the victory (or atone for the bloodshed), and remodelled in the 13th-century stands in partial ruin, its gatehouse still guarding the memory of the battlefield. Cloister arches, monastic remains, and views over the slope where Harold’s army fell will bring the Conquest vividly to mind. It was destroyed in 1538 by a tyrannical beneficiary of that central, powerful English state: Henry VIII.\nAs dusk settles, the last of the autumn light will gild the Abbey’s stone, and participants will head to the pub or disperse, the rustle of fallen leaves echoing the footsteps of history.\nDon't waste that space!\nAutumn walks get busy so please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following: Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control).\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader\nAll pictures were taken by the leader on his recce in August 2025.",

    "Summary": "'Oh no, not again!' you might exclaim at seeing the location and route for this walk, but it is a complete classic. We'll follow the boring footpath along the railway line to the castellated entrance to Clayton Tunnel. We'll look at the twelfth century wall paintings in Clayton Church. We'll reacquaint ourselves with Jack and Jill, the pair of windmills on the South Downs Way. We'll follow that national trail over Ditchling Beacon to Plumpton. We'll see the modest house that the Queen Consort grew up in. We'll take tea and cake in the delightful village of Ditchling. In brief, every last classic and curious feature of the South Downs behind Brighton, plus the views from them over the Weald and over the city itself.\nThe sights:\nClayton:\nA downland village with, as Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\nputs it, 'one striking surprise and two oddities. The oddities are the castellated entrance to the railway tunnel of 1840, and Jack and Jill, a mismatched pair of windmills, he a brick tower mill of 1876, she a wooden post mill of 1821, relocated from Brighton in 1850. [Unfortunately Jack is currently indisposed: he's lost his sails while restoration work goes on. Jill is functioning and open to visitors in the summer]. The surprise is the wall paintings of 1140 in the humble church of St John the Baptist. They are unique in England for their extent, preservation and date.' Buried in the churchyard is Norman Hartnell (1901-1979), fashion designer, best known for his work for the ladies of the royal family including the late queen. Discreetly homosexual and cousin to William Hartnell, first actor to play the Doctor in Doctor Who.\nDitchling Beacon:\nAt 248 metres, it is the highest point in East Sussex. In the care of the\nNational Trust\n, a wide variety of plants can be found there, from chalk downland herbs to certain types of orchid. The hill gives panoramic views to Brighton to the south, the Weald to the north, and the South Downs stretching away to the west and east.\nPlumpton:\nAnimator Gordon Murray's alleged inspiration for Trumpton (Chailey became Chigley and Wivelsfiled Green Camberwick Green) is just a street of cottages with the main suburban residential area at Plumpton Green near the racecourse. St Michael's church is small and Norman with a C13 chancel, but has some faded wall paintings. Plumpton Place is Jacobean, but remodelled by Lutyens in 1927-8. The Laine (former rectory) was the childhood home of Camilla, Queen Consort. At Plumpton Cross Simon de Montfort and his army descended the Downs to engage the army of Henry III at the battle of Lewes in 1264.\nStreat:\nIn a beautiful location with a view to the Downs. The church is over-restored, Norman and C13, but now mostly of 1854. Imposing Streat Place is from 1607-27.\nDitchling:\nBuilt on a crossroads which has the C13 and C14 St Margaret's Church high above it, and very pretty in flint, timber, brick and tile. Interesting buildings include: 'Anne of Cleves' House', which was given by Henry VIII to his fourth queen as part of her marriage annulment settlement; and 'Sopers', the home of wood engraver, stone sculptor, type designer and sexual abuser Eric Gill, which became an artistic community and inspires a museum of the arts and crafts today (designed 2014 by Adam Richards Architects). Noted Ditchling residents include Raymond Briggs and Dame Vera Lynn. Ditchling also has a good supply of pubs and tearooms of which we'll make use.\nKeymer:\nOldlands Windmill is C18, a post mill with an octagonal brick round house.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route details including elevations at the OS website)\n:\nA long, rather tedious footpath next to the railway line will take us to Clayton, where we'll pick up a bridleway past the windmills to connect with the South Downs Way along which we'll head east. At Plumpton Bostall we'll descend the Downs and head north along Plumpton Lane then use footpaths to go near Plumpton Racecourse. We'll then veer west and follow an intermittent bridleway to Streat and Ditchling. At Ditchling we'll head north past Lodge Hill to Oldland. Suburban streets through Keymer and Hassocks will take us back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. There may be some stiles and livestock, plus some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Picture credits: View over the Low Weald:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Morgan\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Ditchling Beacon by Chris Thomas-Atkin:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Jack and Jill Windmills (Clayton Windmills):\nPhoto\n©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Big Bottom:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Capper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Plumpton - Half Moon Public House:\nPhoto\n©\nJames Emmans\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A beautiful autumn afternoon at St Michael, Plumpton (b):\nPhoto\n©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Streat Place:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Clay vale pasture:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); In the centre of Ditchling:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); High Street, Ditchling:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Whitcomb\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Oldland Mill, Keymer:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "We’ll step off the train at Berwick Railway Station into the earthy, woodsmoke-flavoured air of an East Sussex autumn to begin our walk (see the route\nhere\n). A short walk east will lead us to Arlington Reservoir, its still waters reflecting russet trees and scudding clouds. Built in 1971, the reservoir will offer a peaceful start, fringed with golden reeds and alive with birdlife preparing for winter.\nWe’ll follow footpaths into Arlington village, passing the flint-built St Pancras Church, parts of which date back to the 12th century. From there, the path will cross open fields and enter the burnished canopy of Abbots Wood, once part of Michelham Priory’s medieval estate. Among the copper beeches and mossy trunks, we may catch sight of deer slipping through the trees.\nThe walk will then descend into Wilmington, where the Church of St Mary and St Peter, with its Saxon foundations and Norman nave, will stand beside the evocative ruins of a 12th-century Benedictine priory. Before climbing the Downs, we’ll pause at Wilmington’s historic pub—a flint-and-timber inn nestled below the escarpment. With a pint of Sussex ale by the fire or in the garden under golden sycamores, we’ll rest and refuel for the climb.\nFrom there, the Wealdway will lead us up to the Long Man of Wilmington, the enigmatic 92-metre chalk figure carved into the hillside. It is the longest (or tallest) depiction of the human form in Europe but recent research have rather sadly relocated its origins in antiquity to the late 16th- or early 17th century. At the summit, the autumn patchwork of the Weald will unfold beneath us in quiet splendour.\nWe’ll continue over the Cuckmere River and join the Vanguard Way, following it through gentle downland and hedgerow paths into Alfriston. There, timber-framed buildings will lean over winding lanes, St Andrew’s Church will rise with 14th-century grace, and the Alfriston Clergy House—thatched, oak-framed, and acquired by the National Trust in 1896—will evoke a simpler, enduring past. After that, a short walk along the Vanguard Way will return us to Berwick Station for perhaps a pint, but certainly fond farewells.\nDogs\n: Well-behaved dogs are most welcome, but must be kept under control especially where there is livestock.\nTimings:\nWhile leaders make all endeavours to keep the timing accurate, it cannot be guaranteed and we may finish the event later than stated.\nNew members welcome!\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message us, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event may become fully booked, however, if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nadd yourself to the waitlist\n, places often become available closer to the date, and chances are you will still get a place.  And no double booking!\n(Image credits: The Long Man of Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Parker\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Long Man of Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nPAUL FARMER\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Arlington Reservoir:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);\nChurch of St Pancras\n:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Abbots Wood, near Hailsham, East Sussex:\nPhoto\n©\nnick macneill\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Stream Farm, Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nOast House Archive\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Hedge Near Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nPAUL FARMER\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Priory Ruins at Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Hooton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Trig point of Wilmington Hill\nPhoto\n©\nTrevor Littlewood\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The George at Alfriston:\nPhoto\n©\nDavid M Clark\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Alfriston houses:\nPhoto\n©\nMichael Dibb\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A busy day in Alfriston:\nPhoto\n©\nTrevor Harris\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Vanguard Way heading to Stonery Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as\nMonkchester\nbefore taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882.  Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear.

Built to the highest International climbing competition standards, with around 100 lines of roped climbing (including 20 auto-belays), ranging from a dedicated beginner’s area to a comp-class lead overhang wall – offering hundreds of expertly set routes at all levels.  And then there’s the bouldering area; on it's own it would be one of the biggest bouldering venues in the UK - under the same roof! Oh, and don’t forget the café with excellent homemade snacks. Need more kit? - There's a climbers shop too. It’s called\nBig\nDepot for a reason!!  This really is an amazing climbing centre and we can’t wait to welcome you to it!\nWhat is Indoor Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors!\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nOf course, but please sign up to our\nBeginners Session\n, so we can sign you in and supervise you as we show you the ropes.\nWhat about Bouldering?\nAbsolutely!! The Big Depot offers the same high class range of bouldering problems as it does roped climbing. Without the need for ropes bouldering is more accessible for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved, beginners don't need to be supervised, so once we've given you some guidance on how to boulder safely to get you started, you're free to boulder. If you are new to bouldering, as well as signing up here, please message the leader, so we have an idea of numbers needing some guidance. If you're already a boulder - please sign up to this event.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber bur not been to this centre before, you will need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's competency test when you arrive. We'll meet in the café, and after a quick introduction, we'll get you paired up (we'll try and match abilities as best we can!), show you the various climbing areas, and get you climbing.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass this, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there are OutdoorLads leaders available they will be happy to supervise you so you can still climb. If the leaders are already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will still be able to boulder instead (our leaders are only able to sign-in and supervise two climbers during the session).\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for our\nBeginners Session\n;\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nSounds great - where do I sign up?\nRight Here!! Please register via this event page so the event leader can look out for you, but remember, you'll need to pay the centre’s entry fee to the centre on arrival (\nprices are here\n).\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.

It's of the national parks most popular sites, gives great views of the area. It's name means Mother Hill, due to the multiple smaller hills emanating from it's summit; though it's also know as the Shivering Mountain, due to its shale base causing occasional land slips. The summit and surroundings are also archaeologically interesting, being home to several bronze and iron age hill forts.\nLord's Seat:\nThe highest point of the Rushup Edge ridge, this hill will give us more fantastic views of the Peaks. As this will be a quieter part of the walk, we may get to see some of the wildlife that live in the hills too.\nThe Pennine Way:\nEngland's first national trail spans from Derbyshire to the Scottish Border. We'll join the trail after leaving the station, giving us great views down The Vale of Edale.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This walk is a most attractive one, predominantly across fields and through woods,  however don't be deceived by the lovely surroundings as our midway destination of Annesley Hall has quite the chilling aura about it.\nNestled in Nottinghamshire, just next to derelict and spooky Annesley Old Church surrounded by grisly looking gnarled gravestones, the atmosphere can make one quite skittish.  This historic mansion has seen centuries of change, from its medieval beginnings to its Georgian grandeur.\nThe gentle walk back crosses over an old mott and bailey castle earthwork.\nHistorical Insights:\nAnnesley Hall dates back to the 13th century and has been home to several notable families, including the Chaworths and the Byrons. The hall is famously connected to Lord Byron, the notorious poet, who had a doomed love affair with Mary Chaworth, the heiress to Annesley Hall. This unrequited love inspired some of his early works and added to the hall's romantic yet eerie legacy.\nA Spooky Tale:\nLegend has it that the ghost of Mary Chaworth herself haunts the grounds of Annesley Hall. People have reported seeing a forlorn woman in white wandering the gardens at night, believed to be Mary, still mourning her lost love. Some say you can hear whispering in the hallways or see flickering lights in the abandoned rooms. The most spine-tingling tale involves an old oak tree where it's said Mary and Lord Byron would secretly meet. At midnight, those brave enough to stand by the tree might hear whispers of their tragic love story carried on the wind.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The stunning village of Edale (more rightly called Grindsbrook Booth) is one of the most popular villages in the Peak District and is nestled in the Vale of Edale.\nThe Vale of Edale is an isolated valley tucked away in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park, surrounded by mountainous hills and bastions of gritstone topped with wild and exposed moors.\nAccess to the Vale of Edale by car is either by the winding road from Hope which follows the River Noe or by descending the sharp twisting road which leads steeply down from Mam Nick, a natural gap in the hills between Mam Tor and Rushup Edge.\nGreat walks in the Dark Peak can be accessed right from the doorstep. Our plan for Saturday is a walk that takes in the first part of the Pennine Way up onto Kinder Scout, finishing at one of the pubs in the village near the bunkhouse.\nDepending on who's interested and doesn't need to rush off on Sunday morning, there will also a shorter morning walk followed by a pub lunch on offer.\nAccommodation:\nOur digs for the weekend is a superb bunkhouse converted from an 18th-century barn, right below Kinder Scout. The spacious open-beamed living space has stunning views across to Kinder Scout.\nThere are three bedrooms each sleeping six people. Each bunk has a mattress with fitted sheet, and a pillow with pillow case.\nPlease bring your own sleeping bag or duvet!\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "8.3 miles/ 13.35kms circular walk\nThe rolling hills of south Northamptonshire are a relatively unknown gem for walkers in the south Midlands. This very rural, unspoilt area is bounded by Banbury in the west, Brackley to the south, Towcester to the east and Daventry to the north. It has a bit of a Cotswold feel - but without the tourists!\nThis is hunting country - the Grafton Hunt has been chasing foxes across the landscape since the mid 18th century and their more positive legacy is a network of bridleways and green lanes that enable easy access to the countryside.\nOur walk starts in front of the charming 17th century Red Lion pub in Culworth, before we swoop down into a gentle valley and climb up the other side into Eydon which is packed full of soft brown ironstone cottages which are typical of the area. We'll pass by the stocks on Eydon's village green, if any of you want to hurl a few cabbages!\nThere is a short section of road walking without a pavement as we leave Eydon before we head back onto paths. The rest of our walk includes a lovely variety of fine views, a number of fishing lakes and a couple of short stretches of woodland. We'll stop for a picnic lunch just after the half way mark.\nThe final section takes us back towards Culworth with a distant view of the HS2 viaduct construction close to Edgcote House, the stately home that provided the setting for Mr Bingley's \"rented accommodation\" in the BBC's 1997 version of Pride and Prejudice.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nPhotos:\nAll photos taken by walk leader and other ODL members used with permission.",

    "Summary": "Distance: 11.5 miles/18.5km\nThe market town of Rugeley lies on the north-eastern edge of Cannock Chase next to the River Trent. The development of the town during the industrial revolution was greatly influenced by construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal with Rugeley lying between Haywood Junction with the Staffs and Worcester Canal to the north and Fradley Junction with the Coventry Canal to the south. In more recent times, it became synonymous with coal mining at Lea Hall Colliery and the coal-fired power stations, all of which have now been swept away to redevelopment.\nWe will begin our journey at The Old Chancel, the remains of the predecessor to St. Augustine’s Church opposite, a peaceful place with a surprisingly sinister neighbour. After a short walk, we will descend the “bloody steps” to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Brindley Bank, for another foray into Rugeley’s darker past, before crossing Brindley’s aqueduct over the River Trent and following the towpath into the countryside.\nOur walk now follows bridle paths back towards the border of the town and Cannock Chase, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Etchinghill, a small village which has now all but merged with Rugeley is well known to the locals for its ice-age sandstone tip which offers views over the edge of the Chase (as well as a place where generations have carved their initials into the rock).\nFrom there, we will venture into Cannock Chase, stopping at the Birches Valley Forest Centre before continuing to Fair Oak Pools and then following Rising Brook back towards Rugeley and wander through Elmore Park.\nSamuel will be ably assisted on the event by Patrick who's being assessed to become a walk leader too!\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nPhotos:\nAll photos taken by walk leader.",

We will head up to the Bowstones, (a historical pair of Anglian Cross Shafts), situated at the eastern border of Lyme Park National Trust. This is a country estate and deer park.\nWe will then reach the trig point at Sponds Hill which is the highest point of the walk at 410 metres. This will give us amazing views of the west and the east sides.\nWe will then descend the southern border of Lyme Park, looking towards the Manchester city skyline & Jodrell Bank. We will stop here for our lunch break.\nAfter this, we will head east into Lyme Park and walk through Hase Bank Wood, before reaching the Lyme Park House & Gardens. We will stop for a short break for photo opportunities, toilets, and the cafe.\nWe will continue to Cage Hill and visit the Cage Tower, once used as a hunting lodge and a lock-up for prisoners.

    "Summary": "Although this event appears full please use the waitlist as its not unusual for places to become available nearer the time.\nSorry we are not off to Australia or a nice Caribbean Island for this walk, you'll have to plan your own holidays.\nOur route takes us first to the village of Brockweir, where it is reported that vessels up to 90 tonnes could reach this point from the sea, where their cargoes were transferred to shallow barges and hauled up the river by teams of men.  (Unfortunately this is not a scene we are likely to see) In front of the Quay House there is a screw and shaft which is reputed to have come from the Belle Marie, which in 1914 became the last boat to sail to Brockweir.\nWe’ll then cross using the cast iron road bridge which was built in 1904/6, before which only one narrow road led into the village and access was usually achieved by water, with a ferry-taking travellers to and from the Welsh bank. Many of the buildings had river connections, acting as warehouses and although today only one public house remains, there were once 16 inns to satisfy the demands of locals, watermen and shipbuilders.\nFrom here we walk through forest on the Welsh side of the Wye passing through Botany Bay and Barbadoes Green before our arrival at Tintern for lunch.  The plan is to stop at the Abbey Mill for an hour giving plenty of time to explore the galleries and shop. or if you chose make a visit to the Abbey ruins (an entrance fee applies)\nWe then cross back over the wye using the recently restored railway bridge and follow the Wye Valley Greenway before turning off at Green Thorns for the hardest climb of the day back up to the Offa's Dyke path to take in the views at the Devils Pulpit and return to our cars.\nDogs will be welcome on the walk but there are a couple of stiles that larger dogs may find difficult. We also pass through a couple of farms where they would need to be kept under control although they are welcomed at our planned lunch stop.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us on this 11 mile circular walk taking in the delights of Cadbury Castle (Iron Age Hill Fort) and the surrounding villages with some outstanding views over the countryside reaching far beyond as we endeavour to explore more of Somerset and Dorset verging on their neighbouring borders.\nWe will start our walk in the village of South Cadbury a stones throw from the A303 near Sparkford on the junction for the A359. From the village we will ascend to this Iron Age Hill Fort from where we can take in some outstanding panoramic views, which on a clear day from this vantage point are mightily impressive.\nThe back story regarding this site of Arthur's court of Camelot (and, indeed, the very existence of the semi-mythical king himself) is among the greatest and most romantic mysteries of a Dark Age Britain however Cadbury Castle has a better claim than most. Excavations in the 1960s show the hill was extensively refortified around AD500 about the time when a great British chieftain possibly King Arthur was leading the resistance to the Saxon advance in the Southwest. Whether or not this was the case Camelot the site is an impressive one and the views are not only superb though also extensive.\nAfter taking in the Hill Fort we will return back to the village of South Cadbury, and we will embark walking along footpaths across the rolling dry-valley landscape to Charlton Horethorne.\nAfter a lunch break we then venture south-westwards via Seven Wells (the source of the River Yeo) toward Corton Denham, Corton Hill and Parrack Hill, where again we will take in some extensive views across the lush meadows, fertile farmlands, and beyond to the Somerset Levels.\nEventually we will loop around in our walk to pass through the village of Sutton Montis, whose church has a fine 13th century tower and normal chancel arch, returning homeward to our original point of departure of South Cadbury.\nPlease note we shall be walking on a busy road (for a very short distance), quiet lanes, bridle paths, meadows, orchards, and crossing farmland with both arable and livestock (cattle, horses, and sheep). The terrain could be uneven in parts so walking boots should be considered a key and essential part of your kit.\nIt will also be slightly muddy in parts if we have experienced any rain.\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring and Summer walks mean lots of new and existing members excited to be getting out more. Please only book if you know you can make it. Should your plans change please free up the space immediately for someone else who could attend.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nRemember we will encounter livestock and horses, and land owners and authorities have clearly signposted  their expectation of the integrity and assurity they require  of any dog owner, and their dog whilst on their farm land.\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, then feel free to message me or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nImage / photo credits:\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIt is essential that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nEvery person participating should be aware of & accept that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified & are not regarded by Outdoorlads, or themselves, as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience & who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW. Allaway, G. Frost, D. Hanley\n&\nK.

    "Summary": "A day starting in Barnham and heading south to Bognor Regis for lunch on the beach. On the way we’ll see rolling farmland, streams, examples of past and modern architecture before taking in the sights of a seaside resort. Our return journey will see more features such has pleasant parks, the remains of a canal and a historic church.\nThis plan and walk will form the lovely\nStewart Allen\n's assessment event as he endeavours to become a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader for OutdoorLads. Your support for Stewart is sought.\nThe Sights:\nBarnham:\nA village were old meets new. There are plenty of older buildings some going back centuries and new houses, which in fairness do blend in. The village was originally listed in the Domesday book with just 24 households. The area is dotted with massive greenhouses growing an array of vegetables and salad items. If you shop at the major supermarkets then the chances are an item has come from here. The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a lovely hidden gem dating back to 1086. We will be able to look around the grounds and view the inside.\nBognor Regis:\nFamous seaside resort. You will probably have heard of Butlins there. It is also famous for the ‘Bird Man’ competition that used to take place on the pier. The town took on the ‘Regis’ part after the town petitioned King George. This was following his stay in the town following illness.\nBarnham Canal:\nWho’d have thought these rolling fields would hold the remains of a canal. Sadly, it never made any money and the birth of the railway soon put the final nail in the coffin.\nSwimming:\nThis walk\ndoes not\ninclude swimming as the group's insurance policy does not cover it. You may wish to swim but you do so at your own risk.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe leave Barnham Station and walk along Yapton Road before turning on to farmland and pleasant fields. Every so often we get to enjoy farm buildings or an array of clearly expensive houses. This landscape accompanies us to the outskirts of Bognor Regis. Here we see a variety of seaside properties from various time periods. Once reaching the seafront we enjoy a nice stroll along the seafront. The famous Butlins Park is clearly visible on the skyline for much of this section, together with the Pier. The pier of course offering memories of the Bird Man competitions of the past. After lunch we head back inland passing a pleasant arcade of shops and travelling through Hotham Park. This park is dedicated to and was established by Sir Richard Hotham the founder of Bognor Regis. Further inland still we meet a busy part of town with an array of big out of town shops. It is then a trip over the railway crossing and a walk by an airfield before crossing a golf course. More flat and pleasant footpaths await us as we continue before reaching an historic part of Barnham. We get to visit the local church which dates from 1086 and see the remains of a canal. Finally, a gentle stroll takes us back to Barnham station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can take part.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me (Gavin) if you have any questions.\n(All photos taken by the aspiring leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

There are food stalls and merchandise to buy, lots of the local breweries have a bigger presence there with their own stands, and it's a jolly fun day out!

Up to you, but note that you are responsible for your own ticket and OutdoorLads wont be able to reimburse you if you later can't attend.\nWe'll aim to meet at midday on or near Trent Bridge and go in together, but don't worry if you cant be there that early - we can meet you inside.

    "Summary": "'Lads who travelled from London to the south coast for my summer walks might be glad to see that this autumnal walk is much closer to home. Just outside the M25 the land rears up to form the Greensand Ridge. This then folds into a series of hills and heaths (called 'charts') that afford wonderful views of the Weald. The Surrey Hills National Landscape (formerly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) adjoins the Kent Downs National Landscape and we'll move from one to the other and back again, savouring stone-built houses and churches where performers and premiers lived and died. Chief among these is Churchill's Chartwell, the view from which he called 'the most beautiful and charming'.\nThe sights:\nLimpsfield, Crockhamhill and Hosey Commons:\nWooded common land on the Greensand Ridge and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Crockhamhill Common has a series of old ragstone mines that provide a hibernation site for five species of bats. Hazel, oak and sweet chestnut colonise the better soils, but Scots pine and birch the poorer ones.\nChartwell:\nFrom 1922 until his death in 1965 the home of Winston Churchill, much used by him when out of political office for rallying the anti-appeasement cause, composing speeches, writing books, building walls, constructing lakes and painting. An early Victorian house of medieval origins, but rebuilt and extended in an arts and crafts style by Philip Tilden in the late 1910s. The house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \"the most beautiful and charming\" Churchill had ever seen. Grade I listed.\nToys Hill:\nOutstanding views of the Weald are to be had from a terrace donated in 1898 by Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the National Trust, who lived at nearby Crockham Hill. One of the National Trust's first properties. Over the years it was added to, so the National Trust's Toys Hill estate now runs to more than 200 acres (81 ha) of woodland. The area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its abundant wildlife, and a Grade I site of national importance for nature conservation. We'll have lunch at the top which is 235m up and on a terrace which is the remains of the vast Weardale House of 1910, neglected, bombed in the war and pulled down in the 1940s. French Street is a pretty hamlet.\nWesterham:\nNear Sevenoaks and on the River Darent. Granted a market charter in 1277. St Mary's Church is C13 and is unusual in displaying the country's only royal arms of Edward VI. General James Wolfe was born in the town in 1727 and is commemorated by a statue on the Green. Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice lived in the Vicarage for a brief period. John Lennon stopped at a Westerham antiques shop and purchased a poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, which inspired the song, \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" The statue of Churchill on the village green was the gift of General Tito of Yugoslavia. William Pitt the Younger regularly stayed in the town. We'll have a tea/pub break in the town on the way back.\nLimpsfield:\nThe parish has over 20 medieval buildings and around 90 listed ones. Overbuilt St Peter's Church is C12. The composer Frederick Delius is buried in the churchyard, as is his wife Jelka. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham is buried only a few yards from Delius, whose music he supported. Nearby are the graves of cellist Beatrice Harrison and ashes of clarinettist Jack Brymer, both of whom worked with Beecham.\nOxted:\nMostly a suburbanised commuter town, built in excessive, but quite pleasing mock-Tudor stucco and timber framing. The town occupies a gap in the greensand ridge. The Greenwich Meridian runs through the town and Keir Starmer grew up in it.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route, its distance and elevations, at the OS website):\nHaving walked along Station Road and Snatts Hill from the station in Oxted, we'll cross the A25 then follow Rockfield Road to meet the Greensand Way (GSW). This will take us east, all the way to Limpsfield Common, Limpsfield Chart, Crockhamhill Common and Mariners Hill. At Chartwell, we'll take Puddledock Lane eastwards. We'll then ascend and descend Toys Hill but have lunch at the top. Following French Street northwest across Hosey Common and cross the B2026, we'll take footpaths to Westerham for a tea break. We'll then head west along the A25 (there's a pavement) and take a footpath to the southwest to reach The High Chart. A bridleway along the River Darent will take us to Limpsfield Common to cross the Common. Then, walking along Limpsfield High Street we'll get to Granville Road and head west along it to Gresham Road which will bring us back to the station in Oxted.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There will be plenty of shade and woods and commons for them to run free but also some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All images were taken by the leader on his recce.

As of July 2022, it remained on the Heritage at Risk register.\nSt Alkmund's Church\nin Duffield is adjacent to an ancient crossing of the River Derwent, south of the main village. This religious site, during Anglo-Saxon times, was probably a refuge for travellers. The earliest remains of the existing building are from the Norman period. Duffield Bridge was constructed in 13th century and later widened for the Chesterfield Turnpike in 1812.\nNearby\nDuffield\nwas originally a Celtic settlement from about 400BCE. The Romans arrived in the area in 43CE. The Doomsday Survey records \"Duvelle\" in Norman times when Duffield Castle (demolished) was built to protect the hunting grounds of Duffield Frith.\nLooking downstream, dominating the skyline on the eastern bank, is the brick chimney of Peckwash Mill. Originally a corn mill in 13th century but later, a paper mill of massive importance, being the largest producer of paper in the world during its heyday. A terrace of 14 cottages, known as Blue Mountain cottages, were built for the paper mill in about 1850.\nWe head eastwards up Eaton Bank and on to the Midshires Way towards Little Eaton, where we pause at the Queen's Head pub for lunch.

    "Summary": "I don't think that Ashdown Forest, a medieval hunting forest of heathland like the New Forest, but more elevated, has been explored from Buxted before by us 'Lads. On what I hope will be a classic autumn walk, we'll wander among the bracken and birch as their fronds and foliage turn. We'll take in deep draughts of cool air as we survey the panoramic outlines of the High Weald National Landscape. We'll track down one of Ashdown's little waterfalls, and hope that the weather's been wet enough to make it more than a dribble. We'll admire Nutley Windmill’s weathered sails, still standing strong against the sky. We'll down tea and cake at a tearooms with friends old and new.\nThe sights:\nBuxted:\nA historic East Sussex village with Saxon origins, Buxted developed as a Wealden ironworking settlement. Its charming High Street and rolling countryside lend a tranquil rural aesthetic. Buxted Park Hotel was originally an C18 Palladian mansion designed by Sir Thomas Robinson, this Grade II* listed country house is now a luxury hotel, set amid 312 acres of deer park and formal gardens. St Margaret's Church is a flint and stone Norman church dating from the C13, known for its medieval architecture and peaceful setting. Restored in the C19.\nMaresfield:\nA picturesque village mentioned in the Domesday Book, with traditional tile-hung cottages and a C13 church, St Bartholomew. It has a pleasant woodland setting and village green. The Chequers Inn is Georgian. Duddleswell is a scattered hamlet on the edge of Ashdown Forest, known for its tea rooms and forge. Another hamlet, Fairwarp, possesses a striking church: to a simple box of 1881 was added an apse and a tower in an almost expressionistic style in 1930 due to the generosity of the Eckstein family whose monuments are in the churchyard.\nAshdown Forest:\nOnce a medieval royal hunting ground, this 6,500-acre heathland which is part of the High Weald National Landscape, was the inspiration for A.A. Milne's\nWinnie-the-Pooh\n. The landscape offers sweeping vistas and ecological significance. Camp Hill, where we'll have lunch, is an elevated ridge offering panoramic views across the forest.\nThe Airman’s Grave:\nA poignant WWII memorial to a crashed Halifax bomber crew (1941), set in a glade.\nNutley Windmill:\nA rare open-trestle post mill, likely built in the early 19th century. Restored and maintained by volunteers, it’s the only surviving windmill of its type in Sussex and one of only five in the country.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields, woods and heaths for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n:\nHeading west along the A272, we'll pick up a footpath across Buxted Park and then use its driveway to get to Cooper's Green. Millwood Lane and Underhill will take us to Maresfield, then Nursery Lane north to Fairwarp where we'll pick up the Sussex Diamon Way heaidng west. At the Airman's Grave, we'll head north across the heath to Marlpits and Nutley Windmill. At Friends' Clump we'll head east to Camp Hill for lunch. The B2026 will take us to Duddleswell for tea and cake. A footpath and the Wealdway heading south and east will take us back to Buxted.\n(Image credits: Ashdown Forest and the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View across Ashdown Forest from the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of St Margaret:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Buxted Park:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Readings Mead:\nPhoto\n©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Maresfield village centre:\nPhoto\n©\nnick macneill\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nursery Lane, Fairwarp, Sussex:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Trimming\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Christ Church, Fairwarp - Churchyard:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); House to the west of Duddleswell Tea Rooms:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Hawfinch\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Friends' Clump, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nutley Windmill, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Late afternoon sun on Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); All images are copyrighted but are here credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA/2.0\n.)",

    "Summary": "'Here lie I and my three Daughters, All by drinking Cheltenham Waters. If we'd kept to Epsom Salts, We wouldn't be lying here in these Vaults'.\n(Anonymous epitaph, 1701)\nYou too will feel the benefit of coming to Epsom and taking the air, if not the Magnesium sulphate-rich water, on this highly accomplishable, highly London-accessible walk. Being within a desirable suburban area, don't expect vast expanses of open countryside and not seeing a soul. Do expect great views over the racecourse and towards London, a wealth of Late Stuart, Queen Anne and Georgian Houses, and some pleasant commonland corners tucked between them. We'll trace the history of the twin causes of the town's continuing prosperity - Epsom Salts and Epsom Races - but above all, as always, the magic will be manifested in the company we keep and the sense of achievement we attain.\nThe sights:\nEpsom:\nA historic market town, known for its role in the discovery of Epsom salts (Magnesium sulphate) in 1618. The town flourished as a spa destination in Late Stuart and early Georgian era, with Samuel Pepys visiting it in 1667 and noting 'much Company'. Other spas had overtaken it by 1710, and it had declined, but it was rediscovered by wealthy Londoners seeking more salubrious summer air in the 1720s. Notable buildings include the Clock Tower (built in 1847), St Martin of Tours Church, and several Queen Anne and Georgian townhouses. Rosebery Park is a beautifully landscaped Victorian park complete with ornamental gardens, a duck pond, and a bandstand.\nEpsom Racecourse and Grandstand:\nFounded in 1779 for the Epsom Oaks races and expanded with the Derby Stakes in 1780, Epsom Racecourse is one of the world's finest flat racing venues. As is usual, the chalk geology provides well-drained, short, springy turf. The current grandstand, opened in 2009, was designed by architects Populous in a flashy airport style (the elegance of Goodwood is absent). The racecourse was the site of suffragette Emily Davison’s fatal protest in 1913, when she tried to attach a suffragette banner to the King's (George V's) horse Anmer on Derby Day, and was knocked down and trampled. There is a statue to her in Epsom marketplace. This event occurred at Tattenham Corner, a sharply curving section infamous in racing lore, where fortunes often change mid-race.\nWalton Downs:\nLocated on the southern perimeter of the racecourse, Walton Downs forms part of the wider chalk downland landscape. The area was historically used for military training and is now a popular spot for walkers and gallops for training racehorses.\nAshtead Park:\nA historic estate dating to the C17, centered around a manor house redesigned in the C18 by a wonderfully-named architect called Stiff Leadbetter. Once the seat of prominent landowners, it is now home to City of London Freemen’s School. The landscaped grounds are dotted with ornamental lakes and ancient trees, which we'll see, reflecting the ideals of English landscape gardening.\nEpsom Common and Stew Pond:\nA designated Local Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has ancient woodland, heathland, and historic ponds. The Stew Pond—once used to store live fish for feasting by medieval monks—is now a haven for wildlife and walkers.\nThe Well (Epsom Well):\nLocated amid houses on Epsom Common, the Epsom Well was discovered by a farmer in 1618 when he noticed his cows would avoid the bitter water, the bitterness coming from Magnesium sulphate. The waters became famous in the mid-C17 when the waters were found to have purgative, healing and muscle relaxant properties. This led to the creation of the first commercially available mineral salt: Epsom salts. The well’s fame drew visitors from across England, turning Epsom into a fashionable spa town before Bath and Tunbridge Wells gained prominence.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll head northeast up the High Street then turn southeast down Church Street. We'll leave Burgh Hetah Road and take a bridleway to the racecourse. Walking over Grandstand Road we'll cross Epsom Racecourse at Tattenham Corner and proceed across the roughs and gallops on to Walton Downs. A bridleway heading west to Langley Vale will take us to Ashtead Park which we'll walk through before we pick up the Thames Downs Link to Epsom Common. Rounding Stew Pond we'll see The Well and then cross Dorking Road. We'll walk back along Woodcourt Green Road and take a footpath to Rosebery Park. A walk through the town centre and along the A24 will return us to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of times when they have to go on leads, but also lots of times when they don't. There might be sheep and horses but no stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All images taken by the leader and co-leader on their recce in August 2025.)",

    "Summary": "The Wey was one of the first rivers in England to be made navigable and the River Wey Navigation opened in 1653. On this circular route (which includes three kilometres walking through Woking's most salubrious suburbs), we'll walk about five kilometres along the navigation, passing five sets of lock gates as we do so. We'll also follow a stretch of the River Wey to Wisley Common for a change of scenery and a spot of lunch. We'll just skirt the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens before heading back, where the village of Pyrford, remarkably unaffected by the presence of Woking, might be of interest, likewise the ruins of Newark Priory and the house of the poet John Donne.\nThe sights:\nOld Woking:\nThe original centre of Woking and a market town in the C17. Now a forlorn place with some of the old houses demolished to make way for the A247. The Manor House is fine mid-C17, The Grange C18. St Peter's Church was originally Norman, but is now mostly C13. There is a remarkable Norman door with wrought iron fittings from around 1130. There is some character in the lane leading to it. Hoe Place is a former mansion which is home to the Hoe Bridge School Preparatory department. Early Victorian in appearance, it dates from 1680 and was a favourite retreat of Lady Castlemaine, a mistress of King Charles II. The school chapel dates from 1850.\nRiver Wey Navigation:\nThe River Wey and Godalming Navigations provide a 20-mile (32km) navigable route from the River Thames near Weybridge to Godalming. Both waterways are owned by the National Trust but managed by the Wey Navigation Trust. The five locks we'll see (Papercourt Lock has a stepped side channel and Walsham Gate has a weir where the River Wey itself joins) were refurbished in 2021 as part of a £9m programme across seven sites. At Walsham Lock there is also a fish pass to aid fish in spawning.\nNewark Priory:\nThe Priory was granted substantial lands in the late C12 during the reign of Richard I. Originally called Aldbury but changed to 'Newark' from the Latin for 'New Place' (\nnovo loco\n). Dissolved in 1538 and given to the Master of the King's Horse. A cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard the buildings to provide building stone. Lord Onslow, the owner in the 1730s, decided to preserve what remained. A scheduled ancient monument and Grade I-listed. Located on private land so cannot be reached at closer proximity than the Wey path.\nPyrford Place:\nGrade II-listed, considered C17. The big square summerhouse overlooking the Wey bears a plaque claiming that John Donne, the metaphysical poet, soldier and Dean of St Paul's lived there from 1600 to 1604, but it is more likely he lived in a main house nearby. The Wey Navigation was completed in 1653 (here not the natural river), so it seems likely the building post-dates this.\nOckham Mill:\nA five-storey polychrome brick water mill, dated 1862, Grade II-listed.\nWisley:\nThe C12 church, farm buildings and a handful of cottages have been spoilt by the presence of the M25 and a sewage works, so we'll omit them. Wisley Common is heathland, a valuable habitat. We'll edge around RHS Wisley and see some of it from the public footpath. We'll have our lunch on the Common by the mere at about 13.30.\nPyrford:\nPyrford Court is Neo-Georgian, 1910 and used as the American ambassadors residence in the film\nThe Omen.\nWe'll have a drink at The Anchor pub at Pyrford Lock at about 14.30. Pyrford is mentioned in\nThe War of the Worlds\nby HG Wells in which it is near the landing site of the third of ten Martian cylinders and is thus obliterated. Wells would give readings of this passage at dinner parties to his friends from the village, gleefully recounting the destruction of their houses.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website):\nWe'll follow White Rose Lane south and east away from the station and then Hoe Stream through its nature reserve. At Hoe Bridge we'll take the B382 and go south then west to Old Woking. After a short distance along the A247's pavement, we'll head southeast across Broad Mead. Much of the outward-bound route will now be on the Fox Way and along the River Wey Navigation towpath which we'll leave at Ockham to take a footpath to Wisley. After lunch at Wisley Common, we'll walk northwest along Wisley Lane before turning southwest at the church to use footpaths to go to Pyrford Lock and the pub stop. We'll then walk south along the Wey Navigation but turn west at Manor Farm to use footpaths to near Pyrford village. We'll cross Church Hill and use a long straight bridleway to get back to Old Woking, then retrace our steps, following White Rose Lane back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is ideal for them, although there may be some fields with livestock and will be some B-roads to cross. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All pictures were taken by the leader in October 2022 and August 2025. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

Great for those wanting to get public transport from Manchester.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nDovestone Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve is ran by the RSPB and is home to many rare moorland species, most notably the peregrine falcon and mountain hares, which we'll see if we're lucky.\nAlphin Pike:\nThe first of our hills will be well earned after and long steep ascent from Greenfield. We'll be rewarded with fantastic views over to Manchester and back down to the lakes below.\nAshway Moss:\nOur second hill lies deeper into the moorland and gives a more remote feel. The heather will also start to bloom at this time, so the hills may have their purple blanket. Due to it's remoteness, this will be our best chance of seeing some of the animals that live here.\nThe Trinnacle:\nThis fascinating rock formation is looks over the valley below and will be a great picture spot. We won't be climbing onto the formation itself, as that would be beyond the scope of this walk.\nGreenfield Brook:\nAs we return back from the moorland, we descend down the beautiful Greenfield Brook. This will be one of the more challenging parts of the walk, as we'll need to take care coming down the rocky path.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "An 8 mile walk from the edge of Inverness following the River Ness and Caledonian Canal towards Loch Ness, across the locks at Dochgarroch and returning on the opposite bank. The start time is to allow for members to travel by train from Glasgow or Edinburgh. The start location is a 20 minute walk along the River Ness from the centre. Why not make a weekend of it and join Mark on the Sunday at Aldourie Castle Garden (\nAldourie Castle Garden - Scottish Open Gardens | OutdoorLads\n) and the Inverness Social at the Eden Court Cinema / Theatre bar (\nInverness Social | OutdoorLads\n). If you need accommodation, Inverness has lots. The Bught Caravan and Camping site is very close to the start of this walk (invernesscaravanpark.com). Or there are lots of hotel, B&B and hostel options too.\nThis is a flat walk! We will be sandwiched between the River Ness and Caledonian Canal, with views of the hills and woodland close to the northern end of Loch Ness.\nThis is a popular route for walkers, cyclists, joggers and more, and we will almost certainly see plenty of boats on the canal. Built by Thomas Telford, this route provided a crucial short-cut from the North Sea to the Irish Sea for shipping, avoiding treacherous waters around the north and west coasts of Scotland. Nowadays, it is a mecca for pleasure boats and canoeists.\nThere is a good cafe and ice cream parlour at Dochgarroch, as well as basic facilities (loos, coffee bar, if open) at the start.\nThere is an option for a short additional walk at the end to go to the top of Cemetery Hill (for those that crave a couple of contours) with some fine woodland and some great views, especially to the north, over part of the city, the Kessock Bridge, the Moray Firth and the Black Isle.\nPhotos:\ntaken by Rob Mitchell and used with permission.\nDogs are welcome on this walk.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful. All levels are welcome!\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome\n. If you're new to climbing, we've got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity. I keep our group tight-knit to foster connection and ensure personalised coaching for everyone, regardless of your experience level. Many climbers started their journeys relatively “late” in life, incl. some session leaders\n🤫\nWe convene at the\nClimbing Hangar in Reading\n, one of the largest climbing centres in the region. The generously spacious and friendly cafe/lounge is my personal favourite where you can find us socialising, having a cuppa, snacks or even pizza before and after the climbs.\nIf you have never climbed at the Climbing Hangar in Reading before, you must book an induction slot:\nhttps://www.theclimbinghangar.com/locations/reading\n- follow instructions to book an induction slot around the time that this event starts.\nYou also need to\ncomplete the waiver form that is linked in the confirmation email\nonce you've booked an induction slot.\nThis only needs to be done once.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.   We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.  This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat!  Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby.  This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food!  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories!  Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend.  The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.  From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location.  It is much easier to park in the village and walk down.  There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The hostel itself is next door to the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic so you just know this is going to be an interesting weekend.  You can even experience some spirits of a different kind at the Wellington Inn just around the corner - famous for having 3 ghosts wandering it's corridors....\nWhat's going to happen over the weekend\nFriday Evening:\nArrive, meet the rest of the group and socialise, welcome meeting and chill.  We'll have the usual buffet. Please bring something that can be shared between two or three people.\nSaturday Day:\nAfter breakfast (which is included in the event cost), we’ll have a walk planned heading into the surrounding countryside.\nPlease bring a packed lunch with you and maybe pack a flask for a hot drink if it’s cold.\nOr you can stay in the hostel and relax or take the day to explore the Cornish Coast if you've never visited the area.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax, socialise, and chillout until a Halloween Themed Dinner, included in the event cost.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast, we'll spend our final morning exploring the coast around Boscastle.  There may even be a visit to the nearby Tintagel Castle to the south, birthplace of King Arthur himself....\nAccessibility at Boscastle\nPlease note this hostel has options for anyone with accessibility needs.\nThis hostel includes a ground floor 6 bed dormitory with an accessible en-suite bathroom.  The lounge, dining and kitchen are all located on the ground floor.\nThere is good colour contrast to floor, walls and doorways throughout the building. All public areas, halls, stairs and landings are well lit using a combination of ceiling and wall lights. The corridor flooring is carpet throughout.\nUnfortunately there is no lift in the hostel to the 1st floor.\nIt is unlikely that the group day events over the weekend will be suitable if you have accessibility requirements but please contact the leader to discuss and to suggest alternatives you could do instead of the walks.\n(For anyone wondering - BIG Halloween is having a fallow year in 2025.)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Meet with the rest of the group around the enormous dining table and I'm sure someone will light the wood burner. Dinner will be included but will be simple for those that might not arrive till later (probably jacket potatoes with a range of fillings).\nSaturday Daytime:\nAfter breakfast, it will be time to explore some of the stunning countryside surrounding Llanthony.  Prepare for a climb as no matter which way you look, the site is surrounded by hills and mountains, and we will be going up at least one of these to reach the views from the ridge lines.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax and unwind. A simple dinner will be served and once we've cleared this away the board or card games will probably make an appearance. There's the option to walk the 50m or so to the cellar bar at Llanthony Priory or perhaps just read a book by that wood burner.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast we'll need to clean and tidy the barn, but once everything is packed away there will be an option to head to Longtown (either by foot or by car) for a Sunday lunch before heading home.\nTea and coffee will be available throughout the weekend but you'll need to bring a packed lunch for Saturday and anything else you may want to drink (The Cellar Bar does offer 2 Pint Takeouts of the draft beers)\nDogs:\nDue to the limited social and sleeping spaces this event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We'll take our time and climb through the valley all the way to Twmpa otherwise known as Lord Hereford's Knob. Here, you can enjoy the stunning views across to Hay-On-Wye whilst eating your packed lunch.\nWe'll then follow the Cambrian Way path along the Darren Lwyd Ridge taking in more stunning views of the Black Mountains before a steep drop back into Capel-y-ffin.\nAlthough the route is only 8 miles it can be very muddy in places and involves a long climb to Lord Hereford's Knob and a steep decent at the end.\nWhilst dogs are most welcome on the walk it is likely they will need to remain on a lead throughout the walk. When not passing through farm lands there are sheep and wild ponies grazing on the open land.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Our hostel is nestled in the shadow of some of the most well known hills in the country - The Cuillins - tall, sharp and serious lumps of rocks that since the early days of british mountaineering have been a training ground for those planning trips to the Alps. Other wonders of Skye include the Quiraing, the Storr, Neist Point, Loch Coruisk and the Fairy Pools.\nWalk options will be dependant upon leaders attending and the weather. The Cuillins are notorious for collecting clouds so may not be an option unless we get lucky with the weather due to their technicality - the rock has a magnetic ability to play havoc with a compass so being able to see where you're going is a benefit.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nTaken by AMD and used with full permission.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nPlease note!
