Or if you want to totally chill out you can go for a wander around the loch and take in the wildlife.\nThere may be no phone signal but it doesn't mean giving up all your comforts, the hostel is now connected to the estate hydro electricity grid, which has meant that showers have now been installed; and the hostel manager keeps the stove on the go during the afternoon and evening which makes the building cosy - plus it heats the water!\nSorry, this weekend is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos :\nby AMD and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

    "Summary": "This walk spans Stratford, Bow and Poplar which has seen much change over the years. From the Victorian slums, to the devastation caused during the Blitz, and the subsequent post war rebuilding programme. The former London Docks, which saw goods arriving from all over the world, to the creation of the Canary Wharf metropolis and the transformation of Stratford for the London Olympics in 2012.\nI've really enjoyed researching this walk, and I hope you'll enjoy it too. There's plenty of architecture and history and a number of hidden gems along the way, plus it's accessible via a myriad of East London's lesser known waterways, which lead us to the Thames Path.\nWalking route and itinerary\nThis is a linear walk starting at\nStratford Station\nrail, underground station exit (Westfield entrance) and ending at the Jubilee Line underground station in\nCanary Wharf.\nThis route map can be viewed in\nOS Maps\n.\nPoints of interest:\nQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nAquatics Centre\nLondon Stadium\nArcelorMittal Orbit\nFormer Bow Gasworks\nThree Mills island Watermill\nBrutalist Balfron Tower\nCity Island\nTrinity Buoy Wharf\nCanary Wharf\nWaterways we'll follow:\nWater Works River\nCity Mill River\nThree Mills Wall River Weir\nChannelsea River\nBow Creek\nLimehouse Cut\nRiver Thames\nWe meet by the entrance to the Westfield shopping centre where you can buy food and drink and use the toliets. We'll walk through the centre towards the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\nAfter passing the Aquatics Centre on our left we'll cross Water Works River and head for the London Stadium and pick up the path adjacent to the City Mill River. As we exit the park we cross Stratford High Street and take the path adjacent to Three Mills Wall River Weir. We continue to Three Mills Green where we navigate our way around Three Mills Island. We'll stop to admire the beautifully restored watermills. Next to the Channelsea River you'll see some of the last surviving Victorian gasholder frames in the former Bow Gas Works. We take a slight detour from the river to visit a memorial to hundreds of employees of the Gas Light and Coke Company killed in both world wars.\nWe continue along Bow Creek, before reaching Limehouse Cut. Here we leave the river and walk through the housing estates in Poplar. We'll stop to admire the magnificent brutalist Balfron Tower by Ernő Goldfinger, sister building to the Trellick Tower in Kensington.\nFrom here we'll head towards City Island, one of London's newest neighbourhoods, accessible via Canning Town station. We once again cross Bow Creek, where you can pick up refreshments from Sainsburys and buy coffee etc. From here we follow the path to the historic Trinity Buoy Wharf, where we'll stop for lunch and take in the views. There's a cafe and toliets and a restored lightship you can visit, plus a free view of London from the former lighthouse and numerous sculptures and history information boards dotted around the place.\nWe then follow the Thames Path back to Canary Wharf.\nAfterwards\nWe'll head to a bar for a post walk drink.\nNew members\nNew members are always welcome. Please message me in advance if you have any questions before the walk.\nWaitlist: If this event is fully booked, but you'd like to attend, please add yourself to the waitlist. Places often become available closer to the date.\nAll photos taken by the event leader.",

    "Summary": "Join us at this theatre performance with a drag alter ego:\nFixing\nCan something broken ever truly be mended?\nWhen Matt was little, their dad bought a classic car. A 1954 Sunbeam Talbot Mark II. Dad had ideas that he and Matt would do it up, repair, rebuild together. They never did, and the car festered in a garage.\nI mean, Dad had just been through a divorce.\nNow in their 30’s, Matt would like to learn how to fix a car engine. They’d like to learn a bit more about Dad, and that time, when Dad and Mum split up. The time when Matt and Dad were closest. Matt can’t do this alone, which is tricky for a solo show. That’s where Matt’s drag alter-ego Natalie Spanner comes in. She knows all about things that girls like Natalie know about. Like how to build an engine. About maintenance, care and repair.\nTogether, Matt and Natalie will try to ask, in an increasingly broken world, how might we repair ourselves, together?\nTickets are pay as you feel,\nbook a ticket at no cost\nthen decide what to pay at the event.\nAdvisories:\nSexual innuendo, references to divorce, reference to child going missing\nRunning Time:\n75 minutes\n“\nCharming and often very funny look at fractured family life\n” –\nThe Stage\n“\nMiller is as sharp in audience interaction as they are precise as an actor, taking us on a tender, funny and diverting off-road adventure.\n” –\nThe Guardian\n“\nThe show innovatively uses drag to broaden the conversation on masculinity, vulnerability, and self-discovery, giving it an appeal that speaks to LGBTQ+ and general audiences alike.\n” –\nTheatre and Tonic",

Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend one of the beginners (supervised) events\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely! Beginner (supervised) events are not offered every week.\nBouldering\n- Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

Victoria cave was discovered in 1837 during the reign of Queen Victoria, hence the name. It is considered an important archaeological site due to the discovery of animal bones up to 130,000 years old! There was also the discovery of 11,000-year-old tools and artefacts, providing the first evidence of human settlement in the area.\nOn our descent into Stainforth we will pass Catrigg Force, a waterfall cascading over a deep gorge. The beautiful village of Stainforth awaits; we will stop for lunch here after crossing some stepping stones over Stainforth Beck. After lunch, we will pass another waterfall, Stainforth Force, before taking a gentle stroll along the bank of the River Ribble leading us all the way back to Settle. There will be an opportunity to stop for a drink at one of the local establishments in Settle at the end of the walk.\nAll photos taken by walk leader. OutdoorLads has permission to use them.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads For An Evening of INDOOR BOULDERING in Manchester!\nThis event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing.\nBouldering offers a wide range of benefits, including:\nPhysical:\nImproved strength, tone, balance, power, and coordination.\nMental:\nEnhanced problem-solving, focus, concentration, and body awareness.\nEmotional:\nRelaxation, a sense of achievement, and a feeling of mind-body connection.\nBouldering is also a fantastic way to meet new people and build lasting friendships, as it's an inherently social sport where climbers share tips and strategies to conquer the routes.\nNew to Bouldering?\nIf you're new to bouldering, it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader to learn the basics of safe bouldering. The leader can then introduce you to the rest of the group where you can refine your newly learnt skills in a social environment.\nExperienced Boulderer?\nIf you’re new to climbing with ODL, the leader will help to introduce you to the rest of the group so you can explore the centre together.\nYou are responsible for your own safety and actions while bouldering. Please use your own judgement when accepting advice from OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers, regardless of your bouldering experience.\nReady to boulder?\nYou will need to sign up on the ODL event page. We would ask you to do this each time so that the leader has access to important information\nIf you are not already registered with Rock Over Climbing, please do so\nhere\nto save time when you arrive. You only need to do this once.\nWhen you arrive at the centre you will need to pay for entry and hire climbing shoes if you don't own a pair. ODL members benefit from the concessionary rate so please mention this when paying.\nGet bouldering! You’ll find most of the group already bouldering so feel free to join them. If you’re new to bouldering with ODL, the leader will be looking out for you so if you spot them, please go speak with them first.\nAny questions?\nIf you have any questions, please contact the leader directly.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by\nSieh\nand joenellist.",

YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

    "Summary": "Ready for a good stretch of the legs and burn off around 2100 calories on the way? This SE500 walk could be for you – that is, covering 500 metres of ascent over the course of a 13-mile walk. One of the more challenging in a series of walks in the South East, this walk covers some of the most beautiful and historic scenery along the way!\nWe meet at Henley. Henley-on-Thames is a historic town, which has held a market and fair since medieval times. It is well known for it’s five arched bridge over the River Thames, but even better known for the Henley Royal Regatta.\nThe Royal Regatta is an international rowing festival held on the straight stretch of the Thames from the bridge upstream. Teams from around the world take place. The event became royal when Prince Albert became patron in 1851, and has grown in popularity ever since.\nFirst, we cross the bridge to see the Regatta site and the Thames, and rise to Remenham wood. The Chiltern Way joins and we follow it back across the Thames and through the town to the West. Henley is the base for the Chilterns Ultra race, an annual extreme fitness challenge.\nHeading West, we follow the ancient Pack and Prime Lane, rising above a dry valley. We pass the hamlet of Greys Green, where cricket is played on the green and an ancient smithy continued to work until a few years ago.\nWe pass the historic Greys Court, a Tudor country house. The house has been used as a filming location for Downton Abbey, Agatha Christie's Poirot and Midsomer Murders. It has a walled garden, maze and formal courtyard. The remains of an earlier castle can also be seen. Good displays of daffodils can be seen here.\nNext, Lambridge wood shows us its fine beech coppices. Grim’s ditch can be seen in places in the woods, a bronze age mound thought to be a defensive feature. Deep in the woods is a chasm known as fairies hole. Fairies are whispered to dance here under the moonlight.\nOur route continues up a lane to Bix Common, climbs over Round Hill then descends through woods before climbing our last main uphill. We rise westbound onto a spur which makes for a grand re-entry into Henley from above. The top of the spur forms an ancient deer park, Henley Park, headed by a small park house. King George III frequently visited this special spot.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk. It has been a wet winter so be prepared in case of mud here and there; there are plenty of good stretches of path and lane as well on this walk. My planned route (subject to slight adjustment to avoid mud etc) is\nhere\n.\nPhoto credits: Back Greys\nPhoto\n:\nBill Nicholls\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Dower House\nPhoto\n:\nBrian Robert Marshall\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Lambridge Wood\nPhoto\n:\nAndrew Smith\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Lower Assendon\nPhoto\n:\nDes Blenkinsopp\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Assendon\nPhoto\n:\nPeter S\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Henley Park\nPhoto\n:\nDes Blenkinsopp\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Remenham\nPhoto\n:\nSimon Mortimer\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Henley Bridge\nPhoto\n:\nN Chadwick\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Thames Henley\nPhoto\n:\nAndrew Smith\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Henley Thames2\nPhoto\n:\nDavid Martin\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Daffodils\nPhoto\n:\nDiane Sambrook\n© (\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).",

One of the benefits of walking on the prom or beach is that the route will be almost entirely mud free.\nAll images by event leader with the exception of:\nKingsgate bay arch\nby David Hollman licensed under\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n;\nBeach huts, East Cliff, Broadstairs\nby\nNigel Chadwick\n;\nPalm Bay\nby\nNigel Cox\n;\nWest Cliff Arcade and Royal Parade, Ramsgate, Kent\nby\nNick\nall licensed under\nCC BY-SA 2.0",

However it is unlikely that you've enjoyed the fun and the challenge of baring all to compete in the Naturist Foundation Naked 5K.\nTaking place in the beautiful Northwest Kent countryside on a\nprivate\n50 acre site, the course winds its way through woodland paths and stunning surroundings. All this is done while running exactly as nature intended (although running shoes are very highly recommended!!).  Please note that this is mixed gender, all ages event.\nYou must register for the event via this\nlink\n; booking onto the ODL website does not get you into the run.  The cost is £22.00 per participant, paid through the link when registering.\nRegistration opens at 9.30, with a course \"familiarisation\" walk at 11.00 and the run starting at 11.30.  The run is timed, with all participants receiving a participation medal, and trophies to the top 3 males over 50 and the top three overall finishers.\nAfter the run, stick around for the afternoon and make the most of a carnival atmosphere with music and stalls. Enjoy our fantastic facilities — relax in our 18 metre heated covered swimming pool, unwind in the sauna, or freshen up with our hot showers (20p). The Teapot Café serves hot food and our licensed outdoor ‘Sunshine Bar’ will also be open, perfect for refuelling and socializing.\nNaturism is the practice of non-sexual social nudity. For those new to naturism, you’ll soon find that everyone respects you for who you are and will treat you with dignity whatever shape or size.\nAll photos kindly provided for use by the Naturist Foundation, BrockenHurst, Kent.",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n. Alternatively, stay updated on upcoming events using the social media channels below:\nTelegram\n(Climbing and bouldering only):\nOutdoorLads (SE) Climbing\nFacebook:\nhttp://fb.com/OutdoorLadsSouthEast\nTwitter:\n@OdlSouthEast\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We’ll be starting in the ancient town of\nOttery St Mary\n—a place so historic it’s name-checked in the Domesday Book.\nWhether you're a fan of Romantic poetry, a lover of high ridgelines, or a wildlife enthusiast, this walk has a bit of everything.\nThe Hike Highlights\nHistoric Ottery:\nWe’ll begin by exploring the town and its \"Miniature Exeter Cathedral\"—the stunning Parish Church—before leaving the flagstones behind for the forest.\nThe Big View:\nWe’ll climb through the atmospheric\nEast Hill Woods\nto reach the ridgeline. From\nBeacon Hill\n, you’ll be treated to a breathtaking panorama of the Jurassic Coast, stretching from the red cliffs of Sidmouth down toward Budleigh Salterton and Exmouth.\nThe River Otter & The Beavers:\nWe’ll descend into the lush valley to follow the winding River Otter back to town. Keep your eyes peeled! This river is famous for its\nwild beaver population\n. We’ll be looking for gnawed branches, lodges, and—if we’re lucky—the residents themselves.\nThe Day’s Plan\nMeet Up:\nWe’ll gather in the center of Ottery St Mary (check location pin for exact spot) ready for a prompt start.\nThe Pace:\nThis is a social ODL walk. We’ll take the hills at a steady pace and stop for a proper hill-top lunch to soak in those coastal views.\nThe Finish:\nWe’ll aim to be back in Ottery in time for a post-hike drink at a local pub—the perfect way to toast a successful day on the trail.\nNew to OutdoorLads?\nDay hikes are the perfect way to \"test the waters\" with the group. You’ll find a warm welcome, plenty of conversation, and a leader who ensures no one gets left behind. Just turn up and enjoy the fresh air!\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nJoin us for an evening of climbing in one of the UK's top climbing centres. Whether you are new to climbing or a seasoned climber, this centre offers something for everyone with a huge selection of routes including top rope, lead and auto belay.\nPrefer to boulder? That's well catered for as well, with an extensive modern bouldering area ensuring there is plenty to keep you busy, or you can swap between climbing and bouldering on the same night.\nClimbing is the main focus of the event, but this is also a great chance to meet other members and build lasting friendships. Many Outdoor Lads members join through climbing, so if you're new to the group and want to know more, come along and chat over a cuppa during the tea and cake break.\nWhat to expect on your first climb with us?\nIf you are an experienced climber and have passed the centre's proficiency test, we'll pair you up with a climbing buddy and you'll be out exploring the centre in no time.\nIf you have never climbed before or think you could do with a refresher, we offer supervised climbing sessions with one of our leaders, subject to availability. That session will focus on introducing you to climbing, making sure you get plenty of time on the wall whilst also showing you how to belay safely. Due to the centre's rules, we are limited in the number of climbers the leader is able to supervise in each session so if you think you may need a supervised session,\nplease contact the leader before signing up to make sure there is enough space.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nAfter a few supervised sessions, you should be ready to complete the centre's proficiency test and once that has been passed, you'll be able to climb with the rest of the group.\nEverything else you need to know\nYou will need to register with Big Depot before your first visit to the centre but you only need to do this once. If you are an experienced climber, you can save time and do this online\nhere\n, selecting the 18+ unsupervised option. This also applies if you just want to boulder, just select the relevant options during the registration. If you are a beginner and require a supervised session, the leader will help register you when you are at the centre.\nPhotos provided by Sieh.",

We'll have a look at its intricate exterior and pop inside to briefly admire its single span roof, the largest enclosed space in the world in 1868. Stepping outside, we'll cross Euston Road and head towards Bloomsbury. Our next architectural gem is the\nThe Brunswick Centre (1972)\n, a brutalist housing and shopping complex. We'll briefly stop for refreshments, before continuing to\nRussell Square Underground Station (1906)\nadmiring its stunning Leslie Green burgundy facace. Our first Art Deco building the magnificent former\nDaimler Car Hire Garage (1931)\nand in my opinion one of the finest looking art deco buildings in London.\nNext we walk through Russell Square towards our second art deco building - the mighty\nSenate House (1937)\n, now home to the University of London. We'll pass through its art deco foyer and, then head to a 60s icon that dominates the skyline - the one and only\nBT Tower (1964)\n. From here we'll cross back over Euston Road, and walk up the Hampstead Road. Our third art deco masterpiece is the very handsome Greater London House or the former\nCarreras Cigarette Factory (1928)\n, which has been beautifully restored. From here we head towards\nRegents Park\nwhere we'll stop for an hour for lunch.\nNext we head out of the park and cross the Euston Road once again and stop at our fourth art deco building the\nRoyal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) (1934)\nbuilding on Portland Place. Its a short walk to the next art deco building, the famous\nBBC Broadcasting House (1932)\n.

    "Summary": "Our walk begins alongside the rushing waters of the Afon Artro, and towards the end of the walk, we will see the natural lake where the river rises .\nInitially we follow the river downstream for a mile before turning north. After a steady ascent we eventually reach the small promontary of Foel Senigl, from where in good visibility there is quite a panoramic view across the bay of Tremadog towards the bigger peaks of Eryri and also the Llyn Peninsular.\nFrom here we will head east on footpaths across some very wild and untamed landscapes before making it steeply down to the remote and beautiful lake at Cwm Bychan, the source of the river. The last bit of the walk follows the quiet back road in the river valley back to the car park and passes a delightful waterfall.\nThe Neolithic standing stones and Bronze Age hut circles that are scattered around Llanbedr are a reminder that the settlement is very ancient. The woodland in the Artro Valley contains good areas of virgin Celtic temperate rainforest.\nAfter the walk there’s the option to visit at The Victoria Inn at Llanbedr for drinks or food. The pub garden also sits alongside the Afon Artro.\nThis is the first of 2 events in this area this weekend - the second one can be found at this link\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/llanbedr-and-pensarn-circ-superb-welsh-coastline-260308\nIf you fancy making a weekend of it please contact the leader for suggestions of nearby places to stay\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case.\nThis area can become waterlogged; in case of saturated ground we will walk along traffic free tarmac roads most of the way, but this won't detract from the scenery\n,\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved, mostly on a lead, and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.

The emphasis will be very much on getting outside, partaking in activities and getting to know each other!\nWe'll be staying in a YHA venue with dormitory accommodation and good social spaces. Located in Berkshire and a 5 min walk to the River Thames, the site has easy access to lots of opportunities for walking and cycling in particular. There will very likely be chance to visit a local public house over the weekend, as part of a social evening on Saturday night. As leaders, you may well be approached to run an event over the weekend for others to join in with - you have been warned! ;-)\nWe plan to make full use of the weekend, so please plan to depart from 12 noon onwards on the Sunday. For those who wish, there will be an optional Sunday lunch trip (you will need to pay for that yourself.)\nAlthough primarily aimed at leaders in the South East and South West / South Wales regions, this is open to any  of our leaders. A similar event aimed primarily at the\nCentral, North-East and Yorkshire, and North West / North Wales\nregions is taking place in the Peak District.\nTo note:\nThis event is heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads, and all food is provided over the weekend. However, travel expenses are not provided for this event. If that cost is a struggle for you, we don't want that to be a reason for you not to join us - please apply to the\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nfor help with that cost.\nAlthough the standard refund policy applies to this event, if you need to cancel, please do so as early as possible, so we can ensure the event is as full as possible with leaders who can benefit from the weekend.\nIf you are not yet a leader you will need to have applied and be well on with your leader application to join this event. If you're not sure if you should book or not, drop the office a line on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nand we'll chat it through with you. We will remove any bookings from members who are not leaders and haven't got an active leader application in.\nPhotos:\nFrom OutdoorLads Members and used with permission.  YHA Streatley & River Thames pictures from YHA website\nDogs:\nthis event is not suitable for dogs.",

    "Summary": "Join Mike and OutdoorLads for a 10-mile circular walk in the Yorkshire Dales, starting and ending in Malham and passing some amazing geological features along the way.\nJanet’s Foss\nFirstly, our walk will pass Janet’s Foss, a beautiful waterfall cascading into the plunge pool below. It is believed that the waterfall takes its name from a fabled fairy queen who reportedly lived in the cave beside the falls. This spot is a haven for wild swimmers.\nGordale Scar\nWe will then head towards Gordale Scar, a breath-taking limestone ravine with two waterfalls and overhanging cliffs. For fans of ‘The Witcher’ on Netflix, Gordale Scar was used as a location for filming. This is a unique and interesting spot, where climbers can often be found tackling the crag.\nMalham Tarn\nAn uphill ascent takes us towards Malham Tarn, a glacial lake 377 metres above sea level and one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe. The site is owned by the National Trust and is designated as a wetland of international importance.\nMalham Cove\nFor the final part of the walk we will arrive at Malham Cove, a curved limestone cliff formed by glacial meltwater at the end of the last Ice Age. We will walk along the limestone pavement at the top of the cove taking in spectacular views of Malham and the surrounding countryside. The Cove is a haven for climbers and a popular beauty spot. For Harry Potter fans, the limestone pavement at the top of the cove was used as a location for filming in ‘The Deathly Hallows’.\nWe will stop for lunch at the midway point of the walk. There will be an opportunity to stop for a drink at one of the local establishments when we arrive back in Malham at the end of our walk.\nAll photos taken by walk leader, Michael Rhodes.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening at Redpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced (independent) climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend one of the beginners (supervised) events\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely! Beginner (supervised) events are not offered every week.\nBouldering\n- Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at Nottingham’s newest bouldering venue\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nPhotos:\nAll images supplied by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

This does mean repeating a small section of the riverside that we covered in the morning.\nAfter the walk, there will be an optional trip to The High Force Hotel in Forest in Teesdale for anyone who would like a drink.\nPlease note that this walk does NOT include High Force waterfall. If you wish to visit this, tickets cost £3.95 for adults. As winter access is 10am-3pm, you would need to visit before the 10:30 am walk start time. You can find further information on the\nRaby website\n.\nDogs: Well-behaved, under control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. Many stretches of this walk include sheep roaming. I would also note that there are quite a few up-and-over wall stiles towards the end of the walk, so you get a bit of an upper-body workout lifting your dogs over them. You'll need to make sure you're carrying sufficient extra water for your four-legged friend. We will meet natural water on parts of the walk. If you're unsure, contact the leader for guidance.\nIf the event is fully booked:\nPlease join the wait list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event,\nwe’ll make sure you feel welcome. Please\ncheck out the My First Event page\n, and don’t hesitate to drop me a message if you have questions or want to know more about this walk.\nImage/photo credits:\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use.",

    "Summary": "THIS WALK IS ON A FRIDAY\nThis easy linear walk combines cultural sights and visits:\nHunterian Museum – art and science of surgery with some fascinating exhibits.\nInns of Court at Lincoln’s Inn, Gray's Inn and Middle/Inner Temples.\nSt Bride’s - known as the journalist’s or wedding cake church.\n2 Temple Place including its annual art exhibition.\nThe walk is inspired by my days as a young and eager legal beagle around Holborn, long long ago…\nWe will visit sights around Holborn, Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, and stop for stories following the footsteps of lawyers, surgeons and journalists.\nFor the indoor sights, I’ll explain the highlights and we will have time to explore independently. Each sight has free entry. We’ll spend up to 1 hour at the Hunterian Museum and 30 minutes at 2 Temple Place.\nAfterwards, please feel free to join for optional drinks at the Old Bank of England.\nDon't waste that space!\nThe maximum group size is 20 for this event. This is due to it being an urban walk and bookings have been made for the indoor attractions.\nPlease only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nHunterian Museum\nThis is the headquarters of the Royal College of Surgeons, and the museum was reopened in 2023 following a £4.6m redevelopment. It tells the story of the history of surgery to the present day, and you’ll see England’s largest public display of human anatomy. We will have time to visit properly and are booked in.\nThe Inns of Court\nAll barristers must belong to an Inn of Court, and the plan is to walk through all four of them - Lincoln’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, Middle and Inner Temples. This is why the walk is on a weekday. We won’t be able to visit the chapels/great halls, but will pass the impressive barristers’ chambers and gardens, which have the feel of historical Oxbridge colleges.\nChancery Lane and Fleet Street\nThere will be plenty of zig-zagging through the alleys and courtyards of legal London. We should be able to pass St Ethelburga’s Chapel, the old red brick Victorian Gothic Prudential Building and Dr Johnson’s House, where he compiled the Dictionary of the English Language. Fleet Street is the original home of London printing and the press.\nSt Bride’s Church\nThe reconstructed Christopher Wren church is known as the journalists’ church. Its spire may have inspired traditional tiered wedding cakes, and is only exceeded by St Paul’s Cathedral in the City. We may be able to see the memorial to the first known victim of Jack the Ripper and visit the crypt with its Roman pavement.\nTwo Temple Place\nBuilt for Lord Astor (who was one of the richest men in the world) as his office around 1895, with neo-Gothic wooden carvings and windows. It opens for an annual exhibition. This year’s is “Weight of Being: Vulnerability, Resilience and Mental Health in Art” which we are booked in for and will visit.\n—-\nDogs - sorry, no dogs are permitted at these sights.\nNo toilets at start. Toilets at Hunterian Museum before lunch, possible cafes at lunch and near end at 2 Temple Place.\nThe\nroute\ncan be seen on the\nOS Map -\nClick here\n- which is included for guidance only.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day.\nWhilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse",

    "Summary": "My Lord! Your challenge is to conquer the peaks of the Manifold Valley, adding up to 1000 metres of ascent over the day. Along the way you will see much superb scenery of the White Peak, limestone shining in the spring light. The challenge culminates above Thor's cave, marking your Lordship over the whole valley!\nThis difficult hill route follows many steep slopes, making use of access land and permissive paths at times, as well as scrambly banks, so you will need to be comfortable with this kind of walk. We aim to cover the three tops of Wetton Hill, (319m 355m 328m), Ecton Hill (369m), Ecton South top (360m), Dale above Sugar Load (325m), Ossoms Hill (334m) and Thor's Height (294m). The rewards for this are that you will have accomplished an amazing challenge and experienced some unbeatable and incredible views of Thor's cave and the Manifold Valley. The walk southwards on a hidden route towards the impending Thor's cave is particularly spectacular.\nEcton Hill at the north end of our route was the centre of historic copper mines and a wealthy earner for local miners. There are information boards near the mine remains. We'll also see the small cave at Wettonmill, where there is a tearoom, which we will pass mid-afternoon.\nFrom Ossom's Hill we head onward with giant Thor looming ahead, cross the Manifold river and head up a path with a long flight of steps. The cave itself is huge, slippy and scrambly. After the cave, we will go further to circle the giant's lair and come out on top, above the cave, for all round views of the valley.\nThis is as difficult as hill walks get and is pretty much the same as a mountain walk, and certainly good preparation for one, We may adjust the walk according to weather conditions, and there will be an opportunity to miss a peak if you're tired, but please come ready for a challenge. A recent OutdoorLads hill walk would be excellent preparation!\nIf bad weather, we may shorten the route to 500m ascent, but will still include Thor's cave. Note that if you just wanted to see Thor's cave without the rest of the challenge, you might be better choosing a hillwalk focused on that alone, which is offered by OutdoorLads leaders regularly, if not often.\nWell behaved dogs who are fit enough to manage this challenge are welcome to accompany us on this walk.\nNote:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\nPictures: taken by Outdoorlads members, free to reuse.",

This has been accurately measured by parkrun with a professional measuring wheel. It's run on paths and grass, although some sections of the course do accumulate mud, leaves and puddles after rain.  Dependent on availability, marshals will be at key sections of the course, or signs will be in place.\nThe important bit... This is about personal goals. You run/walk at your own pace, don't be scared that you may be slower than other people. Some walk, some run, some jog, some do a combination of all three.\nTo take part in a parkrun and get your official time,\nyou will need to have\nregistered\nto receive your all important barcode\n.\nYou will need to bring this barcode with you either printed or on your phone.\nParkrun events are run nationwide and indeed internationally, so once you're signed up you can attend anywhere.  If you don't have a barcode you can still run but won't get a time.\nPlease see under Location for meeting plans.\nThe event link is here:\nhttps://www.parkrun.org.uk/hull/\nDogs\nparkrun allow one dog per person on a short lead (not extending).  Running with more than one dog, extending leads or waist leads are not permitted at parkrun events.  As a third party event, OutdoorLads does not have any control over this.\nOutdoorLads Running Groups\nIf you want to join the Outdoorlads' national group on the parkrun website, on your parkrun account select Profile, then groups and type \"Outdoorlads (UK)\" and click the Join button.\nYou may also wish to sign up to the\nStrava OutdoorLads running club:\nhttps://www.strava.com/clubs/439735\nPhotos by an OutdoorLads leader (OutdoorWill) and used with permission.",

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out.

Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you.

In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It has its own unique beauty in comparison to further down the catchment.\nWe will have hills, great views and water! The walk is approximately 10 miles long with a 580 meter total ascent\nWe will call at The Bridestones, approximately 430m above sea level. They were formerly the abode of druids and the site of ritualistic and sacrificial ceremonies. It was probably named after Bridia, a Brigantes deity. Legend also suggests weddings took place on the moor giving the \"Great Bride Stone\" and smaller \"Groom Stone\" their name.\nWe will follow the Calder way To Pudsey Clough and straddle the Lancashire borders before heading up and along the opposite side of the valley by Dobroyd Castle, an important, historic building built in 1866 and continue back to Todmorden.\nThis is a dog friendly walk, so well behaved dogs welcome. There are a few stiles on a small section, so bigger dogs might need extra hands.\nWe will finish in The Golden Lion for a great selection of beers and Thai food.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll leader's own images - OutdoorLads has permission to use and them.\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease\njoin the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.",

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn’t have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. With climbs of various grades suitable for complete beginners to seasoned pros, you decide how much you wish to challenge yourself.\nIf you have not visited the Stronghold Centre before, it is recommended that you\npre-register online\nprior to your first visit. Please watch the online introduction video as you may be asked a few easy questions to complete your registration at the centre.\nWe look forward to seeing you at what is always a fun event.\nIf you are new to bouldering you are welcome to join us at our regular weekly Thursday evening and Saturday morning indoor bouldering sessions which are open to all levels.\nAll those attending must also be aware of the centre’s own T&C’s etc. You are responsible at all times for your own safety, actions and involvement.

    "Summary": "This 16 km (10-mile) route begins at Little Chester near the site of a small Roman fort and town known as Derventio. It takes in Darley Park and Allestree Park to the north of Derby city centre, and we visit the Shiny Brewery Tap at Little Eaton where award winning beers are created. Non-alcoholic beverages are available.\nAt the start of the walk we cross the river at Handyside Bridge, also known as Derwent Bridge, built in 1878 for the Great Northern Railway. The railway line closed in 1968 and it was converted to a foot bridge in 1976.\nOn the western side of the river we walk past Derby Rowing Club, formed in 1857.\nDarley Park\nis home to the largest collection of Hydrangeas in Britain, and the third largest in the world. First planted in 1984 it now has over 400 different types, however, there won't be many blooms to see in March.\nWe will pause to take refreshments at Darley Park Tearooms.\nThe settlement of\nDarley Abbey\ndates back to the medieval era, when it was the site of an Augustinian monastery. In the 18th century, the Evans family developed their planned industrial mill village to service their Boar's Head Mill, one of the first water-powered mills at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.\nWe cross over the busy A6 through the suburb of Allestree and into Allestree Park from where we get great views into the Derwent valley. From here we continue uphill to Quarndon, one of the wealthiest villages in the area.\nFrom Bunkers Hill we head back down into the valley, back across the A6, past St Alkmund's Church and over Duffield Bridge towards Little Eaton.\nShiny Brewery was established in 2012 as a small-scale cask brewery operation in the beer garden at the back of the Furnace Inn pub in Derby. It moved to Little Eaton in 2015 and invested in making better beer which is now available nation-wide in cask, keg and cans as well as from the taproom.\nThe Shiny Tap\nalso sells pizzas if you fancy one in the afternoon as well as, or instead of, a packed lunch.\nFrom Little Eaton we cross underneath the A38 ring road on the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and back through Darley Park and Little Chester to the start point.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nNote:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central",

    "Summary": "Join us for the first Friday Fells of 2026 -  a 10 mile circular mountain walk (600m ascent) in the Lake District's most recent extension.\nThe Lake District National Park was extended by about 3% in 2016, adding roughly 188 square miles primarily to its eastern and southern fringes.  This walk takes in part of that extension, Borrowdale - not the famous one near Keswick we all know and love;  the other one... new to the Lake District.\nWe'll start the walk from Low Borrowdale Car Park off the A685 Tebay-Kendal road just south of Tebay village (M6 J38).  At this point, we'll be right next to the M6 and the West Coast Main Line with cars and trains rushing through the Lune Gorge between Scotland and London, but we'll soon be transported into a secret valley that time and almost everyone else seems to have forgotten.  We'll start with a steep climb onto Whinfell Ridge, with amazing views south to Morecambe Bay, west to the Lake District fells, north to the Pennines and the Eden Valley and east to the Howgills. We'll follow the faint path along the undulating ridge to the A6, before dropping into the valley for a peaceful and easy walk back to the start.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at\nThe Cross Keys Inn\nin Tebay.\nYou can find the planned route\nhere\n, though we may vary this depending on the abilities and ambitions of the group and weather conditions.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell-trained dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the\nCountryside Code\n.

    "Summary": "A\n10-mile circular winter wander\nthrough\nSwinley Forest and Bagshot Heath\n, where tall pines creak overhead and sandy paths crunch satisfyingly underfoot. This route mixes wide forest tracks with open, windswept heath, offering big skies, quiet corners, and plenty of space to stomp out the winter blues. Bracing, a little wild, and best enjoyed with rosy cheeks and a well-earned beer or hot drink at the end.\nThe route is essentially a loop around Swinley Forest, which is one of the most popular areas of wild open space in the Bracknell/Camberley area. This is a popular leisure area so no doubt there will be other walkers, families and mountain bikers around, however we will also take a few quieter paths to get away from the masses.\nThere are no stiles on the entire route and the walk is suitable for\ndogs\n.\nWe will commence walking through Bagshot Village, taking Church Lane past St Anne's church and Vicarage Road which leads to a 2km dead straight track into Swinley Forest, past open areas and pine trees. We continue North until the end of the forest area and then West to the LookOut Discovery Centre where we will stop for lunch. After lunch we then go South via the Windsor RRide and the Lower Star Post and when we reach Saddleback Hill go East back towards Bagshot.\nThe route can be found\nhere\n:\nHere is some of the features of the route:\nSwinley Forest\nis a large, tranquil woodland in Berkshire, dominated by tall Scots pine and criss-crossed by wide, sandy tracks. It sits on the edge of Windsor Great Park, an area with deep royal heritage, and was once part of the historic Windsor Forest that served the Crown for centuries as hunting and woodland estate. Today, Swinley Forest is managed for both forestry and recreation, giving it a spacious, open feel with plenty of light filtering through the trees. Popular with walkers, runners, and cyclists, it offers gentle gradients, peaceful routes, and a sense of stepping into a quietly regal landscape just beyond the surrounding towns.\nBagshot Heath\nis an area of lowland heathland in Surrey and Berkshire, England, historically part of the wider Windsor Forest and Great Park. It’s known for its sandy soils, open heath, and wildlife, including heathland birds and reptiles. Much of it is now protected or managed for conservation, recreation, and military use.\nBagshot village\nis a historic village in Surrey, located near the border with Berkshire. It developed as a coaching stop on the main London–Exeter road and later grew with the arrival of the railway. Prince Edward lives with his family at Bagshot Park, a large Grade II–listed mansion set in about 51 acres.",

    "Summary": "🏔️ BIG Spring Camp 2026: The 20th Anniversary Blowout!\nGet ready to pitch up, dress up, and celebrate!\nBIG Spring Camp\nis back for 2026, and it’s a massive one—we are officially\n20 years old!\nWe’re returning to our stunning home in the heart of Eryri (Snowdonia). Imagine a weekend with full use of a rugby club base, surrounded by dramatic peaks, adrenaline-pumping adventures, and a few hundred of your newest best friends. Whether you want to conquer a mountain, get wet in a gorge, or just take it easy, this is the weekend to do it.\n🎂 Twenty Years of OutdoorLads\nSince 2006, we’ve been getting folks outdoors, and we aren't slowing down. Expect some special 20th-anniversary surprises throughout the weekend. We’ve had two decades of mud, sweat, and beers—let's make this the biggest celebration yet! Lots of surprises and we're changing many things up this year, including the activities on offer,  as we make this THE one to remember for the next 20 years..  We can't think of a better place to be to celebrate 20 years of OutdoorLads!\n🛶 The Main Attractions: Activities\nFrom high-octane thrills to low-level wanders, we have it all. While the 2026 schedule is still being polished, here is a flavour of what will be on the menu:\nThe Professional Thrills:\nExpect favourites like White Water Rafting, Coasteering, Zip Lines, and Mine Exploration. We partner with local experts to get your heart racing.\nThe Volunteer Legends:\nOur amazing leaders will be heading out for some scrambling, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, climbing, or just a stroll to the local villages.\nOn-Site Shenanigans:\nGames, challenges and silly fun -  there’s plenty to keep you busy while you're on site!\nActivity bookings will open up in a few weeks. Keep your eyes on your inbox after signing up!\n🍺 The Clubhouse & The Outdoor Inn\nThe clubhouse is our hub. By day, it’s a spot for coffee and watching people tumble off inflatables. By night, it’s a legendary party space. Last year our Saturday evening fancy dress party had us Step Back in Time. Where will 2026 take us..? 🪩\nIn the clubhouse you'll also find the facilities like bathrooms and showers, and generally where you'll find the event organisers if you have any questions.\nThe Outdoor Inn is our more quiet bar area, located around the back of the clubhouse in a big marquee. A good place to chill out, play some board games, or just catch up with that guy you haven't seen since this time last year!\n🍔 Food & Fuel\nNo need to survive on cereal bars alone. You can do it yourself by your tent (just keep those stoves and BBQs off the grass!). Or, you can use our clubhouse catering. We'll have a range of hot breakfasts, delicious evening meals, snacks and grab-and-go packed lunches for your adventures.\n⛺ Tents & Campervans\nTents:\nMost folks bring their own, but if you're new to camping, we have a\nlimited number of\ntents to hire\nfor a small fee.\nCampervans/Caravans:\nSpace is extremely limited (approx. 20 spots). These must be pre-booked and tend to sell out in minutes. So, set your alarms for the booking date, which will be advised in due course - likely to be late February. As this is a rugby club, there's no EHU or waste disposal facilities.\n📜 Rules to Keep Everybody Happy\nThe\nOutdoorLads Code of Conduct\napplies to everyone at all times.\nRespect the grass:\nThis is a rugby club first and foremost. So, no glass, no dogs,  no BBQs/stoves on the grass, and no open fires (other than the 'official' campfire).\nDrugs:\nZero tolerance to illegal substances. Anyone suspected of having drugs will be asked to leave immediately.\nSmoking and vaping:\nNot permitted anywhere in the clubhouse or marquee.\nQuiet Time:\nNoisy fun in the bars; quiet in the camping fields between\n23:00 and 07:00\n. Tents have zero soundproofing.\nSpacing:\n2 meters between tents for fire safety.\nWaste:\nSort your recycling before binning - this is the law in Wales. Don't leave any rubbish lying around. Large items like broken camping chairs need to go home with you to be disposed of.\nVehicles:\nNo cars outside the permitted car park areas. No EV charging on site.\nDay visitors\n: There are no day passes available. You must be booked on to this event to attend BIG Spring Camp for any duration of time.\nNew to OutdoorLads?\n: If you're new (or relatively new) to OutdoorLads and worried about not knowing anybody when you get to BIG Spring Camp, then worry not! You can join one of our smaller new member camps, led by some of our amazing, approachable volunteers, who'll help introduce you to others on the first evening. You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent. Just makes that intro to the event and to OutdoorLads that much easier! We'll make details available nearer the time.\nSpread the cost:\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. The full cost must have been paid by 1st May 2026.\nOutdoorLads Foundation:\nDon't forget that full and concession members who may be experiencing physical, mental or financial challenges can apply for support with the costs of events themselves, or associated spend, to enable fuller participation.

The second part of the ride, once we are on the loopline is almost all off road, There's just a short on-road stretch where we will have to leave and rejoin the Bridgewater Canal to cross the Barton Road Swing Bridge.\nPhotos\ntaken by the ride leader and used with permission.",

I'm by no means an expert, but I do love Art Deco and different styles of architecture and I will endeavour to provide some background about each building from my own research. We'll also pass a number of historic monuments and other notable places of interest.\nWalking route and itinerary\nThis is a\nlinear walk\nstarting at London Bridge Station and ending near Blackfriars rail and underground stations.\nThis\nroute map\ncan be viewed in OS Maps, but is for guidance only. The exact route may differ slightly on the day due to construction work.\nAfter a short introduction to the different Art Deco architectural styles, our first building is directly opposite us -\nSt Olaf House\n(1928)\n. We'll have a look at its inscriptions and ornate entrance before making our way to London Bridge via Queens Walk. Crossing the River Thames we'll stop to admire the view of the City of London and look back at Hayes Wharf. Our second Art Deco building is\nAdelaide House\n(1925)\n, which is currently undergoing renovation. Photos will be shown.\nNext we pass the\nMonument\n(1671)\n, then head up onto Eastcheap to admire the many different architectural styles, with the\nWalkie-Talkie or 20 Fenchchurch Street\nbuilding dominating the skyline. We'll pass Tower Hill Station and view a section of the\nRoman London Wall\ntucked behind a hotel. Our third Art Deco building is the spectacular\nIbex House\n(1937)\n. We'll then pass a number of skyscrapers in the City and make our way to the imposing\nGuildhall\n(1411)\n,\nvia the Bank of England.\nAfter a short walk, we arrive at\nThe Barbican\nEstate\n(1965)\n, where we can stop for about an hour to have some lunch, you can view the\ncurrent exhibition\nor visit the conservatory or walk around this unique brutalist estate.\nOur fourth Art Deco masterpiece is\nFlorin Court\n(1936)\nin the historic Charterhouse Square, before we head past Smithfield Market towards  Farringdon Street. After navigating around a construction site we pass through some secluded alleyways to Fleet Street. Our fifth and sixth Art Deco buildings are the former\nDaily Telegraph\n(1928)\n(currently under some scaffolding) and\nDaily Express (\n1930)\nbuildings\n.\nNote there's not much room to stand here due to the major construction works opposite, so take care.\nThe final part of the walk takes us to the Embankment, where we can admire our seventh and final Art Deco building the\nOxo Tower (\n1928\n)\nand Sea Containers House across the river. It's then a 2 min walk to Blackfriars train and underground station.\nAfterwards\nOptional local drinks at the Retro bar or in Soho for anyone who wishes to join me.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n. Alternatively, stay updated on upcoming events using the social media channels below:\nTelegram\n(Climbing and bouldering only):\nOutdoorLads (SE) Climbing\nFacebook:\nhttp://fb.com/OutdoorLadsSouthEast\nTwitter:\n@OdlSouthEast\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

If you don't fancy doing the full 11 miles, there is an option to get the bus back from Hessle to Hull after lunch.\nSo why not come along and join us to take in some good coastal fresh air in the company of great people!

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening at Redpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced (independent) climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend one of the beginners (supervised) events\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely! Beginner (supervised) events are not offered every week.\nBouldering\n- Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Join us for an evening of culture at All Saints Church Ecclesall with the Sheffield Symphony Orchestra, featuring our very own Andy Ling on the viola.\nGuest conductor:\nJason Thornton\n-\nJason Thornton is the Music Director of Bath Philharmonia. He has conducted orchestras throughout the UK, Europe, America and the Far East, including the RPO, London Mozart Players, City of London Sinfonia, Beijing Symphony Orchestra, Jykasyla Sinfonia (Finland) and the Kaposvar Symphony Orchestra (Hungary).\nPiano Soloist:\nJeneba Kanneh-Mason\n-\nJeneba was a Keyboard Category Finalist in BBC Young Musician 2018, winner of the Murs du Son Prize at the Lagny-Sur-Marne International Piano Competition in France, 2014, and The Nottingham Young Musician 2013. She was also winner of the Iris Dyer Piano Prize at The Royal Academy of Music, Junior Academy, where she studied with Patsy Toh.\nBeethoven’s 3rd piano concerto\nHis first in a minor key, also seen as a bridge between the Classical period governed by structure and form, and the Romantic which spoke to the heart and depicted emotions. At the premiere in 1803, Beethoven's page turner almost had a heart attack when he turned the page during the performance and the score was empty - Beethoven hadn't yet gone completely deaf (but had lost about 60% at this point) and was playing the solo part from memory.\nDvorak - Symphony no. 8 in G major\nApparently reminiscent of a summer's day in the country, with rustic melodies to get you dancing, birdsong and even a thunderstorm.\nWagner - Prelude to Act III of Lohengrin\nAct 3 of Lohengrin is when the wedding takes place. However, as with all opera, it's not over till the fat lady sings and there is lots of tension and tears to come before the final curtain falls.\nTickets can be purchased online\non the SSO website\nan will also be available on the door. The cost is £18.50.\nWe will go for a drink at a nearby pub after the concert.\nImage credits  Main Image - Andy Ling; Image 1 - Samual  Sianipar  (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 2: -Samuel Ramos (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 3  Mea Morrowhart (free to use under the unsplash license)",

These caves offer a unique glimpse into the area's geological and human past. Continuing our journey, we’ll discover Catrigg Force, a secluded waterfall in a tranquil woodland glade. The twin plunges of water provide a peaceful spot to relax and appreciate nature's beauty.\nAs we approach Stainforth, we'll then encounter the Hoffman Kilns, remnants of the region's industrial heritage. These towering structures, once used for lime burning, stand as a testament to the area's history. This walk is a perfect blend of natural beauty and historical intrigue, making it an ideal walk. Join us and experience the wonders of the Yorkshire Dales!\nWhen we finish we can grab a brew and cake from the Naked Man Cafe.\n(All photographs taken by the walk leader and with permission to use)",

    "Summary": "Join Outdoors as we celebrate our\n20th Birthday\nat Winter Camp in the heart of the Lakes District, back to where it all began in 2006.  Whether you have been around since that time or joined us recently, all are welcome. Winter Camp was OutdoorLads' first EVER event back in 2006 and the perfect place to kick off our year of celebratory events! This year we are making it bigger and better than ever, with a choice of tents, pods, campervans or a hostel to bring together as many members as possible to launch the celebrations!\nThis event page\nDOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ACCOMMODATION\n.\nIt is for those coming for the activities only - walks and the Saturday evening social\nevent at a local pub, which includes dinner. Hence this page is for those who live locally, or have booked your own accommodation separately.\nWith the towering Langdale Pikes looming above it, our campsite is a particularly dramatic spot to pitch up for an adventure in the outdoors. The award-winning site offers a wide selection of grassy pitches as well as a collection of wooden camping pods. It boasts two newly upgraded toilet and shower blocks, washing-up areas, a laundry and drying room.\nThe name should give it away, but this is camping in the winter and so it will be cold! While it's not for the faint hearted, equally it's not out of reach of anyone. It goes without saying that you'll need to make good preparations to keep warm and dry all weekend, but having done that, you'll find that winter camping can be a great experience. Think mountain view, cold, and if you're lucky some snow, but also think roaring fires in great pubs with hearty food, good conversation with new and old friends, all making a memorable weekend.\nOn the Saturday there'll be a range of walk and activity options of varying difficulties. They will vary depending on the conditions at the time, but in this part of the country, every walk is a stunner and there are lots of options - very likely there will be a harder mountain walk and something a bit easier, but there will still be lots of ascent involved - this is the Lake District after all.\nOn the Sunday we hope you'll stay around for another, shorter walk. We aim to be finished around mid-afternoon.\nDepending on the conditions, there may also be the opportunity to learn/improve your winter walking skills as we have three great winter walking leaders on hand to share their knowledge and experience.\nOur campsite has great onsite facilities including a cafe serving early morning breakfast snacks and some truly great showers which are free to use, heated by the onsite Biomass boiler. Truly environmentally friendly! You will need to provide your own food EXCEPT for Saturday evening, as that meal is included in the price!\nBirthday Celebrations\nOn the Saturday evening at we plan to visit a nearby pub who are preparing us dinner, and a private space for a bit of a social evening.  The food is included in the event price, and there are options provided for those with dietary requirements, don't worry! (You will need to have your dietary requirements up to date on the event page please, or we cant guarantee to be able to cater for different needs on the night.)  Obviously drinks are at your own cost that night.\nThis is a great chance to relax with your OutdoorLads friends, reminisce over the last 20 years,  laugh about the good times, the bad fancy dress decisions and the challenging climbs!\nDogs\n: Well behaved dogs are welcome, must remain on a lead on site and owners will need to clean up after them. Dogs listed under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 are not permitted at National Trust campsites.\nPhotos:\nTaken by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",
