    "Summary": "A day starting in Barnham and heading south to Bognor Regis for lunch on the beach. On the way we’ll see rolling farmland, streams, examples of past and modern architecture before taking in the sights of a seaside resort. Our return journey will see more features such has pleasant parks, the remains of a canal and a historic church.\nThis plan and walk will form the lovely\nStewart Allen\n's assessment event as he endeavours to become a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader for OutdoorLads. Your support for Stewart is sought.\nThe Sights:\nBarnham:\nA village were old meets new. There are plenty of older buildings some going back centuries and new houses, which in fairness do blend in. The village was originally listed in the Domesday book with just 24 households. The area is dotted with massive greenhouses growing an array of vegetables and salad items. If you shop at the major supermarkets then the chances are an item has come from here. The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a lovely hidden gem dating back to 1086. We will be able to look around the grounds and view the inside.\nBognor Regis:\nFamous seaside resort. You will probably have heard of Butlins there. It is also famous for the ‘Bird Man’ competition that used to take place on the pier. The town took on the ‘Regis’ part after the town petitioned King George. This was following his stay in the town following illness.\nBarnham Canal:\nWho’d have thought these rolling fields would hold the remains of a canal. Sadly, it never made any money and the birth of the railway soon put the final nail in the coffin.\nSwimming:\nThis walk\ndoes not\ninclude swimming as the group's insurance policy does not cover it. You may wish to swim but you do so at your own risk.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe leave Barnham Station and walk along Yapton Road before turning on to farmland and pleasant fields. Every so often we get to enjoy farm buildings or an array of clearly expensive houses. This landscape accompanies us to the outskirts of Bognor Regis. Here we see a variety of seaside properties from various time periods. Once reaching the seafront we enjoy a nice stroll along the seafront. The famous Butlins Park is clearly visible on the skyline for much of this section, together with the Pier. The pier of course offering memories of the Bird Man competitions of the past. After lunch we head back inland passing a pleasant arcade of shops and travelling through Hotham Park. This park is dedicated to and was established by Sir Richard Hotham the founder of Bognor Regis. Further inland still we meet a busy part of town with an array of big out of town shops. It is then a trip over the railway crossing and a walk by an airfield before crossing a golf course. More flat and pleasant footpaths await us as we continue before reaching an historic part of Barnham. We get to visit the local church which dates from 1086 and see the remains of a canal. Finally, a gentle stroll takes us back to Barnham station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can take part.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me (Gavin) if you have any questions.\n(All photos taken by the aspiring leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

There will often be activities on the water we can watch when we reach our destination, and along the way we can enjoy the relative calm of the walk alongside the Grantham Canal and the River Trent.\nAfter our return to Nottingham City Centre those who wish to, can stay with the group for a pub meal in one of Nottingham's finest real ale pubs, before getting the train / bus / tram back home at the end of the evening.\nWith very easy transport access from further afield into the centre of Nottingham and it being a quiet midweek night, this event is designed to be relaxed and easy going with a focus on meeting friends and chatting as opposed to climbing big hills and stunning views - all of which we love of course, but it's great to mix it up too!\nPlease feel free to message the event leader with any queries, questions or just to say hello in advance if you're new!\nPhotos\n: National Water Sports Centre copyright Geoff Pick and rafting photo copyright Lynne Kirton, both used under this\nCreative Commons Licence.\nPub photo by Liam Russell and used with full permission by OutdoorLads.\nDogs\n: The route is suitable for dogs on leads, but I can’t guarantee that the pub afterwards will be.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Event Suitability – Intermediate & Experienced Climbing Evening\nThis event is suitable for:\nExperienced Trad climbers.\nClimbers who are ready to take the next step beyond beginner outdoor sessions and gain more experience climbing outdoors in a supportive, low-pressure environment.\nTo attend, you should:\nBe able to\nlead belay confidently\n(If you can't lead belay, message the event leader to confirm whether you can be accomodated based on the experience level of other attendees)\nBe\ncomfortable\nclimbing\nindoor routes graded 5A or above\nBe either already leading trad routes (placing gear) or looking to\nsecond a route\nwith traditional protections outdoors.\nWe’ll typically climb in\npairs or small groups of three\n, depending on the number of attendees and the routes available and will match less experienced climbers with more experienced Trad climbers. Climbing in threes allows more opportunity for rest, observation, and learning.\nWhat is Seconding?\nIf you're\nseconding a route\n, you'll follow the climber who led the route up (see below for explanation on leading), placed gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) and attached the rope to the gear they placed. In a group of three:\nThe\nfirst second\nclimbs the route with the rope already in place, primarily focusing on movement and getting used to the rock. This climber does not remove any gear, but will need to unclip the rope and re-clip as they pass any protection.\nThe\nsecond second\nfollows after and\nremoves the gear\n(nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) that was placed by the leader. This is a vital role and a great way to build an understanding of traditional protection placements.\nSeconding allows you to experience outdoor climbing with less pressure than leading while still engaging with gear and rope systems. It’s an ideal way to build outdoor climbing experience before leading your own routes.\nWhat is Leading?\nThis person goes up the route first,\nplacing protection\nor gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) to protect themselves as they ascend.\nOnce they reach the top of the route, the lead climber's job is to:\nBuild a secure anchor\nusing fixed gear (like bolts) or traditional protection (nuts, cams, etc.)\nSet up the system so others can safely climb the route on\ntop rope\n(Not to be confused with top roping indoors)\nAfter the anchor has been built, the role of belaying switches from the person on the ground, to the person who lead the route from the anchor they have built at the top of the climb.\nWhen second climbers ascend the route on top rope:\nThey are protected from above by the rope, so any fall is very short.\nThey climb to the top, and top out rather than being lowered back to the ground.\nThis event is ideal if:\nYou’re a\ncompetent indoor lead climber\nlooking to gain real rock experience\nYou’ve seconded or climbed outdoors before but want to develop further\nYou’re looking to bridge the gap between indoor (or sport climbing) and outdoor trad\nYou’re happy to take turns belaying, seconding, or leading based on the group setup\nThis event is\nnot suitable for absolute beginners\nor anyone who has not yet learned to lead belay.\nIf you’re unsure whether this event is right for your current level, just drop me a message, we may have some flexibility depending on group dynamics and experience levels.\nLocation\nStanage offers a variety of climbs, and the team will ensure that you both enjoy your Trad Climbing experience but are also challenged. There may also be the opportunity to abseil/rappel down a selected route where a dedicated Group Abseil point will be established.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Come for a relaxed\nThursday daytime\nsocial at the legendary Nottingham Robin Hood Beer Festival - one of the biggest in the country! Held at the world famous Trent Bridge Cricket Ground, with both indoor and outdoor spaces, this is a great day our for fans of\nreal ale and real cider.\nIf you are a lager, wine or gin fanatic, I wouldn't bother, there will be very little there to appeal to you!\nYou get a half pint glass on entry, which is yours to keep if you wish, and then can buy beer from a multitude of stalls in half pint or third-pint measures, so you can sample several different beers. There are food stalls and merchandise to buy, lots of the local breweries have a bigger presence there with their own stands, and it's a jolly fun day out! We'll find an area there that we will loosely use to meet up, as we will be going off to buy beer, and so we wont be staying as a whole group for the whole day - but that's good for getting to chat to new people! Note that the event is cashless.\nTo come on this event, you will need to sign up to this event page, but then you will also need to buy a ticket to gain  entry to the festival itself. You can buy a ticket for\nThursday 9th October here\n- it is £12 until the 8th August, after which it is £15 in advance, or £18 if you pay on the day. Up to you, but note that you are responsible for your own ticket and OutdoorLads wont be able to reimburse you if you later can't attend.\nWe'll aim to meet at midday on or near Trent Bridge and go in together, but don't worry if you cant be there that early - we can meet you inside. We'll have a Telegram group on the day to help stay in touch.\nSo come and have a fun, sociable day trying different beers with OutdoorLads!\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nAll taken by L Russell and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Little ringed plovers, avocets and oystercatchers sometimes breed, while in winter the lagoons are home to pintails, wigeons, goldeneyes, snipe and shovelers. Rarer visitors include bitterns.\nThere will be ample opportunity on this walk to stop and view birdlife from the various hides on the site. The walk will not be wholly on the reserve but include field paths and tracks in the countryside surrounding the reserve, where you can enjoy the redkites as they glide majestically across the skies.\nA good time for collecting blackberries and slows as we stroll along tracks and paths.\nThe reserve has apple trees scattered around its grounds and is happy for visitors to take some, as long as there's some left for the wildlife, so bring your carrier bag should you wish to have some free apples to make apple pie over the weekend (*Note: Baking is optional)\nAfter the walk there's the option to enjoy tea and cake at the nearby Yolk Farm cafe before your journey home.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this event.

    "Summary": "'Lads who travelled from London to the south coast for my summer walks might be glad to see that this autumnal walk is much closer to home. Just outside the M25 the land rears up to form the Greensand Ridge. This then folds into a series of hills and heaths (called 'charts') that afford wonderful views of the Weald. The Surrey Hills National Landscape (formerly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) adjoins the Kent Downs National Landscape and we'll move from one to the other and back again, savouring stone-built houses and churches where performers and premiers lived and died. Chief among these is Churchill's Chartwell, the view from which he called 'the most beautiful and charming'.\nThe sights:\nLimpsfield, Crockhamhill and Hosey Commons:\nWooded common land on the Greensand Ridge and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Crockhamhill Common has a series of old ragstone mines that provide a hibernation site for five species of bats. Hazel, oak and sweet chestnut colonise the better soils, but Scots pine and birch the poorer ones.\nChartwell:\nFrom 1922 until his death in 1965 the home of Winston Churchill, much used by him when out of political office for rallying the anti-appeasement cause, composing speeches, writing books, building walls, constructing lakes and painting. An early Victorian house of medieval origins, but rebuilt and extended in an arts and crafts style by Philip Tilden in the late 1910s. The house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \"the most beautiful and charming\" Churchill had ever seen. Grade I listed.\nToys Hill:\nOutstanding views of the Weald are to be had from a terrace donated in 1898 by Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the National Trust, who lived at nearby Crockham Hill. One of the National Trust's first properties. Over the years it was added to, so the National Trust's Toys Hill estate now runs to more than 200 acres (81 ha) of woodland. The area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its abundant wildlife, and a Grade I site of national importance for nature conservation. We'll have lunch at the top which is 235m up and on a terrace which is the remains of the vast Weardale House of 1910, neglected, bombed in the war and pulled down in the 1940s. French Street is a pretty hamlet.\nWesterham:\nNear Sevenoaks and on the River Darent. Granted a market charter in 1277. St Mary's Church is C13 and is unusual in displaying the country's only royal arms of Edward VI. General James Wolfe was born in the town in 1727 and is commemorated by a statue on the Green. Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice lived in the Vicarage for a brief period. John Lennon stopped at a Westerham antiques shop and purchased a poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, which inspired the song, \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" The statue of Churchill on the village green was the gift of General Tito of Yugoslavia. William Pitt the Younger regularly stayed in the town. We'll have a tea/pub break in the town on the way back.\nLimpsfield:\nThe parish has over 20 medieval buildings and around 90 listed ones. Overbuilt St Peter's Church is C12. The composer Frederick Delius is buried in the churchyard, as is his wife Jelka. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham is buried only a few yards from Delius, whose music he supported. Nearby are the graves of cellist Beatrice Harrison and ashes of clarinettist Jack Brymer, both of whom worked with Beecham.\nOxted:\nMostly a suburbanised commuter town, built in excessive, but quite pleasing mock-Tudor stucco and timber framing. The town occupies a gap in the greensand ridge. The Greenwich Meridian runs through the town and Keir Starmer grew up in it.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route, its distance and elevations, at the OS website):\nHaving walked along Station Road and Snatts Hill from the station in Oxted, we'll cross the A25 then follow Rockfield Road to meet the Greensand Way (GSW). This will take us east, all the way to Limpsfield Common, Limpsfield Chart, Crockhamhill Common and Mariners Hill. At Chartwell, we'll take Puddledock Lane eastwards. We'll then ascend and descend Toys Hill but have lunch at the top. Following French Street northwest across Hosey Common and cross the B2026, we'll take footpaths to Westerham for a tea break. We'll then head west along the A25 (there's a pavement) and take a footpath to the southwest to reach The High Chart. A bridleway along the River Darent will take us to Limpsfield Common to cross the Common. Then, walking along Limpsfield High Street we'll get to Granville Road and head west along it to Gresham Road which will bring us back to the station in Oxted.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There will be plenty of shade and woods and commons for them to run free but also some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All images were taken by the leader on his recce.

It is a popular nature reserve because of the diversity of habitats and species present.\nAllestree Hall\nis a 19th-century former country house, a Grade II listed gritstone building. Since the 1980s the hall has been unoccupied but the city and English Heritage are looking to find a suitable redevelopment. As of July 2022, it remained on the Heritage at Risk register.\nSt Alkmund's Church\nin Duffield is adjacent to an ancient crossing of the River Derwent, south of the main village. This religious site, during Anglo-Saxon times, was probably a refuge for travellers. The earliest remains of the existing building are from the Norman period. Duffield Bridge was constructed in 13th century and later widened for the Chesterfield Turnpike in 1812.\nNearby\nDuffield\nwas originally a Celtic settlement from about 400BCE. The Romans arrived in the area in 43CE. The Doomsday Survey records \"Duvelle\" in Norman times when Duffield Castle (demolished) was built to protect the hunting grounds of Duffield Frith.\nLooking downstream, dominating the skyline on the eastern bank, is the brick chimney of Peckwash Mill. Originally a corn mill in 13th century but later, a paper mill of massive importance, being the largest producer of paper in the world during its heyday. A terrace of 14 cottages, known as Blue Mountain cottages, were built for the paper mill in about 1850.\nWe head eastwards up Eaton Bank and on to the Midshires Way towards Little Eaton, where we pause at the Queen's Head pub for lunch. From there we climb\nDrum Hill\n, a Scout Camp started in 1927, now the county campsite for Derbyshire Scouts.

It was dissolved in 1536 and the priory was demolished. Only a single arch remains of the monastic buildings.\nAt Morley we pass a terrace of\nAlmshouses\n, built in 1656, heading towards Breadsall on the Roman road, Ryknild Street.\nThere is an option to visit the\nJoiner's Arms\n, Quorndon, at the end of the walk for a drink (and meal if places are available).\nDogs\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "I don't think that Ashdown Forest, a medieval hunting forest of heathland like the New Forest, but more elevated, has been explored from Buxted before by us 'Lads. On what I hope will be a classic autumn walk, we'll wander among the bracken and birch as their fronds and foliage turn. We'll take in deep draughts of cool air as we survey the panoramic outlines of the High Weald National Landscape. We'll track down one of Ashdown's little waterfalls, and hope that the weather's been wet enough to make it more than a dribble. We'll admire Nutley Windmill’s weathered sails, still standing strong against the sky. We'll down tea and cake at a tearooms with friends old and new.\nThe sights:\nBuxted:\nA historic East Sussex village with Saxon origins, Buxted developed as a Wealden ironworking settlement. Its charming High Street and rolling countryside lend a tranquil rural aesthetic. Buxted Park Hotel was originally an C18 Palladian mansion designed by Sir Thomas Robinson, this Grade II* listed country house is now a luxury hotel, set amid 312 acres of deer park and formal gardens. St Margaret's Church is a flint and stone Norman church dating from the C13, known for its medieval architecture and peaceful setting. Restored in the C19.\nMaresfield:\nA picturesque village mentioned in the Domesday Book, with traditional tile-hung cottages and a C13 church, St Bartholomew. It has a pleasant woodland setting and village green. The Chequers Inn is Georgian. Duddleswell is a scattered hamlet on the edge of Ashdown Forest, known for its tea rooms and forge. Another hamlet, Fairwarp, possesses a striking church: to a simple box of 1881 was added an apse and a tower in an almost expressionistic style in 1930 due to the generosity of the Eckstein family whose monuments are in the churchyard.\nAshdown Forest:\nOnce a medieval royal hunting ground, this 6,500-acre heathland which is part of the High Weald National Landscape, was the inspiration for A.A. Milne's\nWinnie-the-Pooh\n. The landscape offers sweeping vistas and ecological significance. Camp Hill, where we'll have lunch, is an elevated ridge offering panoramic views across the forest.\nThe Airman’s Grave:\nA poignant WWII memorial to a crashed Halifax bomber crew (1941), set in a glade.\nNutley Windmill:\nA rare open-trestle post mill, likely built in the early 19th century. Restored and maintained by volunteers, it’s the only surviving windmill of its type in Sussex and one of only five in the country.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields, woods and heaths for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n:\nHeading west along the A272, we'll pick up a footpath across Buxted Park and then use its driveway to get to Cooper's Green. Millwood Lane and Underhill will take us to Maresfield, then Nursery Lane north to Fairwarp where we'll pick up the Sussex Diamon Way heaidng west. At the Airman's Grave, we'll head north across the heath to Marlpits and Nutley Windmill. At Friends' Clump we'll head east to Camp Hill for lunch. The B2026 will take us to Duddleswell for tea and cake. A footpath and the Wealdway heading south and east will take us back to Buxted.\n(Image credits: Ashdown Forest and the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View across Ashdown Forest from the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of St Margaret:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Buxted Park:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Readings Mead:\nPhoto\n©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Maresfield village centre:\nPhoto\n©\nnick macneill\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nursery Lane, Fairwarp, Sussex:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Trimming\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Christ Church, Fairwarp - Churchyard:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); House to the west of Duddleswell Tea Rooms:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Hawfinch\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Friends' Clump, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nutley Windmill, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Late afternoon sun on Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); All images are copyrighted but are here credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA/2.0\n.)",

    "Summary": "'Here lie I and my three Daughters, All by drinking Cheltenham Waters. If we'd kept to Epsom Salts, We wouldn't be lying here in these Vaults'.\n(Anonymous epitaph, 1701)\nYou too will feel the benefit of coming to Epsom and taking the air, if not the Magnesium sulphate-rich water, on this highly accomplishable, highly London-accessible walk. Being within a desirable suburban area, don't expect vast expanses of open countryside and not seeing a soul. Do expect great views over the racecourse and towards London, a wealth of Late Stuart, Queen Anne and Georgian Houses, and some pleasant commonland corners tucked between them. We'll trace the history of the twin causes of the town's continuing prosperity - Epsom Salts and Epsom Races - but above all, as always, the magic will be manifested in the company we keep and the sense of achievement we attain.\nThe sights:\nEpsom:\nA historic market town, known for its role in the discovery of Epsom salts (Magnesium sulphate) in 1618. The town flourished as a spa destination in Late Stuart and early Georgian era, with Samuel Pepys visiting it in 1667 and noting 'much Company'. Other spas had overtaken it by 1710, and it had declined, but it was rediscovered by wealthy Londoners seeking more salubrious summer air in the 1720s. Notable buildings include the Clock Tower (built in 1847), St Martin of Tours Church, and several Queen Anne and Georgian townhouses. Rosebery Park is a beautifully landscaped Victorian park complete with ornamental gardens, a duck pond, and a bandstand.\nEpsom Racecourse and Grandstand:\nFounded in 1779 for the Epsom Oaks races and expanded with the Derby Stakes in 1780, Epsom Racecourse is one of the world's finest flat racing venues. As is usual, the chalk geology provides well-drained, short, springy turf. The current grandstand, opened in 2009, was designed by architects Populous in a flashy airport style (the elegance of Goodwood is absent). The racecourse was the site of suffragette Emily Davison’s fatal protest in 1913, when she tried to attach a suffragette banner to the King's (George V's) horse Anmer on Derby Day, and was knocked down and trampled. There is a statue to her in Epsom marketplace. This event occurred at Tattenham Corner, a sharply curving section infamous in racing lore, where fortunes often change mid-race.\nWalton Downs:\nLocated on the southern perimeter of the racecourse, Walton Downs forms part of the wider chalk downland landscape. The area was historically used for military training and is now a popular spot for walkers and gallops for training racehorses.\nAshtead Park:\nA historic estate dating to the C17, centered around a manor house redesigned in the C18 by architect Stiff Leadbetter. Once the seat of prominent landowners, it is now home to City of London Freemen’s School. The landscaped grounds are dotted with ornamental lakes and ancient trees, which we'll see, reflecting the ideals of English landscape gardening.\nEpsom Common and Stew Pond:\nA designated Local Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has ancient woodland, heathland, and historic ponds. The Stew Pond—once used to store live fish for feasting by medieval monks—is now a haven for wildlife and walkers.\nThe Well (Epsom Well):\nLocated amid houses on Epsom Common, the Epsom Well was discovered by a farmer in 1618 when he noticed his cows would avoid the bitter water, the bitterness coming from Magnesium sulphate. The waters became famous in the mid-C17 when the waters were found to have purgative, healing and muscle relaxant properties. This led to the creation of the first commercially available mineral salt: Epsom salts. The well’s fame drew visitors from across England, turning Epsom into a fashionable spa town before Bath and Tunbridge Wells gained prominence.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll head northeast up the High Street then turn southeast down Church Street. We'll leave Burgh Hetah Road and take a bridleway to the racecourse. Walking over Grandstand Road we'll cross Epsom Racecourse at Tattenham Corner and proceed across the roughs and gallops on to Walton Downs. A bridleway heading west to Langley Vale will take us to Ashtead Park which we'll walk through before we pick up the Thames Downs Link to Epsom Common. Rounding Stew Pond we'll see The Well and then cross Dorking Road. We'll walk back along Woodcourt Green Road and take a footpath to Rosebery Park. A walk through the town centre and along the A24 will return us to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of times when they have to go on leads, but also lots of times when they don't. There might be sheep and horses but no stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Image credits: Gallops:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Capper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); London View from Grandstand Road, Epsom:\nPhoto © Kotomi\n(\ncc-by-nc/2.0\n).

    "Title": "A Waterside Walk from Woking to Wisley by Way of the Wey",
    "Date": "Saturday Sep 13 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "6",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "34",
    "Summary": "The Wey was one of the first rivers in England to be made navigable and the River Wey Navigation opened in 1653. On this circular route (which includes three kilometres walking through Woking's most salubrious suburbs), we'll walk about five kilometres along the navigation, passing five sets of lock gates as we do so. We'll also follow a stretch of the River Wey to Wisley Common for a change of scenery and a spot of lunch. We'll just skirt the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens before heading back, where the village of Pyrford, remarkably unaffected by the presence of Woking, might be of interest, likewise the ruins of Newark Priory and the house of the poet John Donne.\nThe sights:\nOld Woking:\nThe original centre of Woking and a market town in the C17. Now a forlorn place with some of the old houses demolished to make way for the A247. The Manor House is fine mid-C17, The Grange C18. St Peter's Church was originally Norman, but is now mostly C13. There is some character in the lane leading to it. Hoe Place is a former mansion which is home to the Hoe Bridge School Preparatory department. Early Victorian in appearance, it dates from 1680 and was a favourite retreat of Lady Castlemaine, a mistress of King Charles II. The school chapel dates from 1850.\nRiver Wey Navigation:\nThe River Wey and Godalming Navigations provide a 20-mile (32km) navigable route from the River Thames near Weybridge to Godalming. Both waterways are owned by the National Trust but managed by the Wey Navigation Trust. The five locks we'll see (Papercourt Lock has a stepped side channel and Walsham Gate has a weir where the River Wey itself joins) were refurbished in 2021 as part of a £9m programme across seven sites. At Walsham Lock there is also a fish pass to aid fish in spawning.\nNewark Priory:\nThe Priory was granted substantial lands in the late C12 during the reign of Richard I. Originally called Aldbury but changed to 'Newark' from the Latin for 'New Place' (\nnovo loco\n). Dissolved in 1538 and given to the Master of the King's Horse. A cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard the buildings to provide building stone. Lord Onslow, the owner in the 1730s, decided to preserve what remained. A scheduled ancient monument and Grade I-listed. Located on private land so cannot be reached at closer proximity than the Wey path.\nPyrford Place:\nGrade II-listed, considered C17. The big square summerhouse overlooking the Wey bears a plaque claiming that John Donne, the metaphysical poet, soldier and Dean of St Paul's lived there from 1600 to 1604, but it is more likely he lived in a main house nearby. The Wey Navigation was completed in 1653 (here not the natural river), so it seems likely the building post-dates this.\nOckham Mill:\nA five-storey polychrome brick water mill, dated 1862, Grade II-listed.\nWisley:\nThe C12 church, farm buildings and a handful of cottages have been spoilt by the presence of the M25 and a sewage works, so we'll omit them. Wisley Common is heathland, a valuable habitat. We'll edge around RHS Wisley and see some of it from the public footpath. We'll have our lunch on the Common by the mere at about 13.30.\nPyrford:\nSt Nicholas' Church is humble, unaltered and in the centre of a loose grouping of brick cottages. It is intact Norman and Grade I listed. Fine wall paintings. Pyrford Court is Neo-Georgian, 1910. We'll have a drink at The Anchor pub at Pyrford Lock at about 14.30. Pyrford is mentioned in\nThe War of the Worlds\nby HG Wells in which it is near the landing site of the third of ten Martian cylinders and is thus obliterated. Wells would give readings of this passage at dinner parties to his friends from the village, gleefully recounting the destruction of their houses.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website):\nWe'll follow White Rose Lane south and east away from the station and then Hoe Stream through its nature reserve. At Hoe Bridge we'll take the B382 and go south then west to Old Woking. After a short distance along the A247's pavement, we'll head southeast across Broad Mead. Much of the outward-bound route will now be on the Fox Way and along the River Wey Navigation towpath which we'll leave at Ockham to take a footpath to Wisley. After lunch at Wisley Common, we'll walk northwest along Wisley Lane before turning southwest at the church to use footpaths to go to Pyrford Lock and the pub stop. We'll then walk south along the Wey Naviogation but turn west at Manor Farm to use footpaths to go to Pyrford village. We'll then use Church Lane northwards to Pyrford Court where we'll pick up a footpath through the woods called the Rough. We'll emerge into suburbia at Maybury and use Park Road to get back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is ideal for them, although there may be some fields with livestock and will be some B-roads to cross. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All pictures were taken by the leader in October 2022. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "A tiny detour to Guildford Castle will show us the route for day's walk, map-like, from the top of the keep. The quiet flow of the River Wey and a gentle climb will bring us to St Catherine’s Hill, where we’ll pause to take in more views. From there, we’ll continue to the remarkable Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery for lunch, tea and cake. As we walk over the Hog's Back, and the A3 back toward town, the clean lines of Guildford Cathedral will rise ahead and we'll savour its internal serenity after its external monotony. We could finish with a swim at the newly refurbished Guildford Lido, a cool end to a warm day. We’ll walk, talk and gawk, and make the most of late summer’s lethargic loveliness.\nThe sights:\nGuildford Castle:\nSituated on a small but prominent chalk hill, Guildford Castle was likely built by William the Conqueror around 1066–1086. Originally a motte-and-bailey design, the stone keep was added in the C12. The well-maintained grounds, including vibrant flower displays and panoramic views, lend considerable charm. Tickets to ascend the keep and view the view are £5, and entrance is optional.\nRiver Wey Navigation at Guildford:\nCompleted in 1653, the River Wey Navigation was one of England’s earliest navigable rivers. Engineered by Sir Richard Weston, it connected Guildford to the Thames at Weybridge, transforming Guildford into a trading hub. The towpaths, locks, and converted mills remain key heritage features.\nSt Catherine’s Hill, Guildford:\nThe hill rises to the south of Guildford and is crowned by the remains of St Catherine’s Chapel, a C14 pilgrimage site. The hill provides sweeping views of the River Wey and surrounding countryside. The chapel ruin, likely built of local Bargate stone, is modest but evocative.\nWatts Gallery – Artists’ Village:\nLocated in Compton the Watts Gallery is dedicated to the work of George Frederic Watts (1817–1904), a celebrated Victorian painter and sculptor. Opened in 1904, the purpose-built Arts and Crafts-style gallery was designed by architect Christopher Hatton Turnor. The surrounding 'Artists’ Village' includes studios, gardens, and the Watts Chapel. The gallery houses an impressive collection of symbolist, allegorical and portrait art. An exhaustive visit takes two hours at least, so we'll see the free exhibition of sculpture, the shop, and the cafe where light lunches can be bought.\nWatts Mortuary Chapel and Cemetery:\nDesigned by Mary Watts (1849–1938) and built between 1896 and 1904, the Watts Chapel is a masterpiece of the Arts and Crafts Movement. It combines Romanesque, Celtic, and Art Nouveau influences in a richly symbolic, red-brick structure. Local villagers helped create its detailed reliefs and decorations under Mary Watts’s guidance. The adjoining cemetery includes George and Mary Watts’s graves and other notable interments such as that of the author Aldous Huxley. I find the interior oppressive and sickly, but not in a deliciously decadent Viennese fin-de-siècle way. That said, it is unique and quite remarkable.\nGuildford Cathedral:\nPerched on Stag Hill, Guildford Cathedral is a rare C20 Anglican cathedral, designed by Sir Edward Maufe and constructed from 1936 to 1961, interrupted by World War II. Built with what Pevsner called a 'sweet-tempered, undramatic curvilinear gothic' style in red brick and Portland stone, its form is restrained and monumental. Though often considered austere, the interior reveals serenity and elegance. Highlights include the Lady Chapel, the font by William Wilson, and contemporary artworks such as the recently-completed sculpture on the west front. Opinions on its beauty vary, but its architectural coherence and symbolism are notable. What is disappointing is the absence of landscaping and the dreary suburban road leading up to it, the one that Gregory Peck and Lee Remick's characters brought their squirming and screaming stepson Damien up to attend a wedding in\nThe Omen\n(1976). Watch\nhere\n.\nDapdune Wharf:\nA former industrial hub on the River Wey Navigation, Dapdune Wharf was home to the Stevens family’s barge-building operations from the C17 through the early C20. It’s now a National Trust site, preserving workshops, dry docks, and historic barges.\nGuildford Lido:\n(Optional, and at the end of the walk)\n'A refreshing outdoor escape in Stoke Park: Guildford Lido boasts a historic 50 m\nheated\npool set amid 4.5 acres of landscaped gardens. With weekend winter swims, accessible facilities, fun water slides, and art‑deco charm, it consistently draws 90,000 annual visitors—perfect for family fun or peaceful laps alike' (from Wikipedia). The lido dates from the 1930s and was refurbished in 2024.\nGuildford High Street:\nA visually striking and historically rich thoroughfare, lined with buildings spanning from the C16 to C19. Its standout feature is the 1683 Guildhall, with an ornate projecting clock and baroque façade. Other key structures include Holy Trinity Church (1769), Abbot’s Hospital (1619), a Jacobean almshouse, and Tunsgate Arch. The street mixes Georgian symmetry with Tudor timber-framing, making it one of the most picturesque town centres in England.\nThe swim:\nThe swim at Guildford Lido (so permissible as patrons are covered by the pool's insurance) will take place at the end of the walk, is optional, and involves a total of an extra two kilometres to the pool and back. The pool is spacious (50m long) and heated. A swim costs £9.98. Book\nhere\nif you're interested in doing this.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There will be some woods but little shade otherwise, plus a lot of urban walking. Dogs are not permitted at the pool, of course, but could run in the adjacent park. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n:\nSave for a small detour to see the castle, we'll walk south and southwest along the Wey South Path before picking up the North Downs Way (NDW) to head west to Compton and the Watts Gallery where we'll have lunch, but before that, we'll do a loop south then west along a footpath at West Warren Wood. Picking up the NDW again. Re-entering West Warren Wood, will pick up a footpath ascending the Hog's Back to go to Sunnydown. We'll head further north, cross Farnham Road (the A31), then head northeast along High View Road. Using a footbridge, we'll cross over the A31 and use a footpath to go to the University of Surrey's Research Park. Daphne Jackson Road, Gill Avenue, Egerton Road will take us east to the Cathedral. We'll head east along Union Hill through the university to cross the railway line, which is where those not going to the lido will leave us. Yorkies Bridge and Walnut Tree Close will take us the the River Wey. Woodbridge Road, Stocton Road and Lido Road will take us to the lido. After the swim, Stoke Road and Chertsey Street will take us to the top of the High Street which we'll use to go back to the station.\n(Images: Footpath near Conduit Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nAlan Hunt\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "Brownsea Island, owned by the National Trust, is a gorgeous island and nature reserve sitting in the picturesque Poole Harbour. It is famous for its nature and history, as the home of red squirrels as well as the birthplace of the Scouting movement.\nThis is a leisurely day out in which we'll get the boat from Poole Quay, spend some time wandering around the island before getting the boat back. Please note there is a cost for the boat crossing as well as island entry - as detailed below.\nWe will meet at the meeting point as detailed below before getting our ferry tickets from the orange kiosk, for which we'll aim for the 11:00 crossing.\nAn adult ferry ticket is £14.50 return\n. During the crossings you will get to see the delights of Poole Harbour - the second largest natural harbour in the world - including Sandbanks (home of the rich and famous), the other harbour islands, and glimpses of the Isles of Purbeck on the other side.\nEntry to the island is\n£11 per adult\n(or free for National Trust members). Once there, I have no fixed agenda - we will stay as a group and probably conduct a circular walk of the island which is about 4 miles, with flexibility for us to stay longer at different places should the group wish. Please bring a packed lunch which we will eat at one of the many beaches. We will see some of the main sites including Brownsea Castle (closed to the public) and the Baden-Powell Scouting statue. Hopefully we will glimpse some red squirrels too!\nAs the group wishes, I intend for us to get the 15:00 or 16:00 crossing back to Poole. Once back there, I will propose visiting one or two of the lovely pubs along Poole Quay or in the nearby Poole Old Town.\nPlease note that\ndogs are not permitted\nto enter Brownsea Island by the National Trust.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The River Wandle is one of the better-known of London's minor rivers, and has avoided the fate of so many other waterways in the capital in being able to flow openly along virtually all its course rather than being culverted and hidden away from view. Even so, many Londoners remain unaware of its presence.\nIt rises in Croydon as a chalk stream, and flows for nine miles through the London boroughs of Croydon, Sutton, Merton and Wandsworth to empty into the Thames just above Wandsworth Bridge.\nIn the 18th & 19th centuries, the river was heavily industrialised with factories along its length powered by no less than 68 water wheels. As a result, it became one of the most polluted rivers in England and by the 1960s was considered ecologically dead.\nSince then, strenuous efforts have been made to clean up the river and to restore it to health, and these have borne fruit with the return of trout and other fish to the water. Local nature reserves have been established along its length, and in 1988, the Wandle Trail was created for walkers and cyclists to travel along the river banks from East Croydon to Wandsworth.\nThe route\n(see location section for OS link):\nNote: This is a linear walk.\nStarting on the north side of Clapham Junction station, we'll head north to join the Thames path by Plantation Wharf, and walk upstream along Battersea Reach and under Wandsworth Bridge to reach the mouth of the Wandle where it empties into the Thames.\nNow we'll join the Wandle Trail, and follow it inland with the river as our near constant companion as its surroundings gradually change. We'll pass through Wandsworth town centre, where the river is culverted and out of sight, then down the long expanse of King George's Park to reach Earlsfield. The next mile or so is gritty and industrial as we pass through Summerstown until we arrive first at Wandle Meadow Nature Park and then the lovely late-Victorian Wandle Park of 1890, where we'll stop for lunch.\nAfter the break, we carry on through Colliers Wood to reach Merton Abbey Mills, a converted 18th century textile factory now housing crafts & artisans, and then the National Trust property of Morden Hall Park, consisting of a mansion of 1770 surrounded by 125 acres of parkland and reed-beds.\nLeaving Morden Hall Park, we continue up the Wandle, switching from bank to bank as we pass through Ravensbury Park, Poulter Park and Hackbridge to finally reach the genteel surroundings of The Grove and Carshalton Ponds and so to Carshalton station.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, but they will need to be on a lead along busy roads and footpaths and in proximity to livestock & wildfowl. Please also be aware that we will be close to open running water for much of the walk. At all other times, a dog must be obedient.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect?

Our plan for Saturday is a walk that takes in the first part of the Pennine Way up onto Kinder Scout, finishing at one of the pubs in the village near the bunkhouse.\nDepending on who's interested and doesn't need to rush off on Sunday morning, there will also a shorter morning walk followed by a pub lunch on offer.\nAccommodation:\nOur digs for the weekend is a superb bunkhouse converted from an 18th-century barn, right below Kinder Scout.

    "Summary": "Rearranged from 29th July to 27th September.\nJoin Outdoor Lads for a big day out, hill walking at the edge of The Peak District. Great for those wanting to get public transport from Manchester.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nDovestone Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve is ran by the RSPB and is home to many rare moorland species, most notably the peregrine falcon and mountain hares, which we'll see if we're lucky.\nAlphin Pike:\nThe first of our hills will be well earned after and long steep ascent from Greenfield. We'll be rewarded with fantastic views over to Manchester and back down to the lakes below.\nAshway Moss:\nOur second hill lies deeper into the moorland and gives a more remote feel. The heather will also start to bloom at this time, so the hills may have their purple blanket. Due to it's remoteness, this will be our best chance of seeing some of the animals that live here.\nThe Trinnacle:\nThis fascinating rock formation is looks over the valley below and will be a great picture spot. We won't be climbing onto the formation itself, as that would be beyond the scope of this walk.\nGreenfield Brook:\nAs we return back from the moorland, we descend down the beautiful Greenfield Brook. This will be one of the more challenging parts of the walk, as we'll need to take care coming down the rocky path.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Difficulty & Distance": "This hike is about 21km (13 miles) with roughly 500m (1700 ft) of ascent. There is a steep ascent early in the walk and a scrambly descent over rocky ground towards the end. Much of the walk is up in the moorland on faint trails.",

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

We will be sandwiched between the River Ness and Caledonian Canal, with views of the hills and woodland close to the northern end of Loch Ness.\nThis is a popular route for walkers, cyclists, joggers and more, and we will almost certainly see plenty of boats on the canal. Built by Thomas Telford, this route provided a crucial short-cut from the North Sea to the Irish Sea for shipping, avoiding treacherous waters around the north and west coasts of Scotland. Nowadays, it is a mecca for pleasure boats and canoeists.\nThere is a good cafe and ice cream parlour at Dochgarroch, as well as basic facilities (loos, coffee bar, if open) at the start.\nThere is an option for a short additional walk at the end to go to the top of Cemetery Hill (for those that crave a couple of contours) with some fine woodland and some great views, especially to the north, over part of the city, the Kessock Bridge, the Moray Firth and the Black Isle.\nPhotos:\ntaken by Rob Mitchell and used with permission.\nDogs are welcome on this walk.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Start your weekend early with a 9 mile circular mountain walk (720m ascent) through the North Pennines National Landscape to the summit of Cross Fell, the highest peak in The Pennines.  The walk starts from Kirkland, near Penrith, in Cumbria's beautiful Eden Valley.\nThe Pennines are known as the backbone of England.  They rise in the Peak District, south of Manchester, and run up to the Scottish Border.  This walk takes us to their highest point, Cross Fell, which presides majestically over the Eden Valley.  You will have seen it from the M6, the A66 and many Lakeland fells.  Cross Fell is also the highest point of the Pennine Way; the highest point in England outside the Lake District; the source of the mighty River Tees; and home to the UK's only named wind, the Helm Wind, which blows ferociously down its slopes in certain conditions (but hopefully not in August!).\nThe Eden Valley and the North Pennines are often overlooked due to their proximity to their much more famous neighbour on the other side of the M6, the Lake District National Park.  However, this is a beautiful area of unspoiled villages and farmland surrounded by fells on three sides, which more than deserves the walker's attention.  This being the height of August and school holiday madness in the Lakes, we thought this was the perfect time for Friday Fells to visit this quieter corner of Cumbria.\nThe walk starts in the hamlet of Kirkland and climbs to cross the summit plateau of Cross Fell, with its impressive cairn and summit shelter.  After visiting the source of The Tees, we'll descend by a different path to make a circular walk.\nIf we have a strong group and are making good time, we may add an out and back trip further along the ridge to another local landmark, the radar station on Great Dunn Fell.   You may have noticed this white golf ball like structure from the M6.  This radar station is operated by National Air Traffic Services and is a key part of the air traffic control system for Northern England and Southern Scotland.  This will add about 3 miles (1 hour) to the day.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at a local pub.\nYou can find the planned route\nhere\n, though we may be unable follow this exactly on the day.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell-trained dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the\nCountryside Code\n.

    "Summary": "This is a fairly level circular walk that sets off from picturesque Cotswold town of Bradford-on-Avon, notable for its 13th century Norman bridge flanked by large former cotton mills, nestled alongside the River Avon, and the Kennet and Avon Canal. While the walk route won't take us past the bridge, it is well worth a short trip into the town centre before or after the walk.\nFrom our start point we will set off south on the canal path before heading south west by Wild Brook and through open meadows and through Rufus wood towards Farleigh Hungerford Castle where we can take our lunch.  These medieval castle ruins where built in two stages. The inner court 1377 to 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford, steward to John of Gaunt. The second phase was completed around 1445 by Sir Thomas's son Walter Hungerford, who served with King Henry the 5th at the Battle of Agincourt.  Should anybody wish to, then there will be time to take a quick look inside the castle grounds during the lunch break, however English Heritage do charge an entrance fee to gain access to the ruins.\nAfter lunch we follow the River Frome north passing close to Iford Manor house whose origins may be as early as late 15th century. The classical manor house façade was added around 1730, and the hanging woodlands above the garden were planted later in the 18th century.\nFrom here we continue to the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon at Freshford before we arrive at the grade II listed Avoncliff Aqueduct which carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon and the Bath to Westbury railway line, and was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801.\nFor the final stage of the walk, we follow the River Avon and the Kennet and Avon canal back passing the spectacular 51 metre 14th Century monastic tythe barn of Barton Grange, which we can take a quick look inside, before arriving back in Bradford-on-Avon.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

From here the route heads back up to re-join the Polden Way at Collard Hill, the location of the re-introduction of rare Large Blue butterflies in 2000.  From here we follow the Polden Way back to our start point, passing the large column that can be seen in the distance throughout today's walk.  The grade II listed Admiral Hood monument, is a 110ft Tuscan column built in memorial for vice admiral Sir Samuel Hood.  From this location you should also be able to see Glastonbury Tour in the distance.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Another 340m of ascent will get us over Pen Cerrig-Calch (701m). It may be dark before we find a place to sleep (at an altitude of about 650m), so bring a low output head torch to use while walking and preparing to sleep.\nIn the morning we'll get to the top of Pen Allt Mawr (719m), for an early morning panoramic view across all of the Black mountains; followed by Pen Twyn Glas (646m) and then access the only reliable spring (so far), top up 0ur water and have lunch.  ( YOU NEED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS TO RENDER THE WATER FIT FOR YOUR CONSUMPTION).

Whether you're a seasoned climber or completely new to the sport, our sessions cater to all levels of experience.\nSet in the former St. Benedict's Church, Parthian Climbing Centre boasts over 195 roped routes, auto-belays, and two dedicated bouldering areas. With a variety of grades and styles crafted by some of the UK's best route setters, it offers a wealth of interesting climbing options for climbers of all abilities.\nThose familiar to climbing will already know that climbing is a full-body workout that engages muscles you never knew you had, helping to improve your strength whilst improving your balance and coordination. However climbing is more than just a physical activity - it’s a great opportunity to socialise with other members making long lasting friendships with like minded people.\nNew to climbing?\nNo problem! Our sessions are open to all abilities. If you're new or out of practice, we'll provide a supervised session to help you climb safely and confidently.\nPlease contact the leader in advance to book a supervised session, as spaces are limited.\nExperienced climbers\nTo climb unsupervised, you'll need to demonstrate basic climbing skills, including:\nFitting a harness correctly\nTying in with the correct knots\nBelaying and lowering another climber\nAnswering safety questions\nIf you're unsure about any of these, opt for a supervised session – we'll help you find routes that match your ability whilst you refresh your skills.\nReady to climb?\nSign up! Please register via the event page so the event leader can look out for you.\nIf you are new to the climbing centre, complete their\nwaiver\nin advance to save time on the day. You only need to do this once.\nYou’ll need to pay the centre’s entry fee directly (found\nhere\n) on arrival directly to the centre (ODL Members receive a concessionary rate discount)\nWe’ll be waiting in the reception area so come join us. If you are running late, don’t worry, we’ll be in the climbing area so let us know when you arrive and we’ll get you set up.\nHelpful resources\nIf you want to practice your knots before climbing here are some useful videos on YouTube (not made by ODL) for:\nhow to tie a figure of 8\nhow to belay\nAny questions?\nPlease feel free to contact the leader directly if you have any questions. The best way to do this is to message the leader directly rather than leaving a message on the event.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by\nSieh\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nFor bouldering - absolutely!! There is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help you adjust and climb safely and effectively.\nThe main type of rope climbing on offer at this event is lead climbing, which requires those attending to have a basic understanding/introduction to Harnesses, knots and belaying first.\nSo after some consideration, we don't believe this particular event is suitable for complete beginners and we would recommend you have done your first session at one of our other events. However, if you have done\none session\nat another event and you are comfortable with climbing (or just need a refresher) please don't be put off! Sign up and let the leader know! We are still more than happy to take on climbers who are only just starting out.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

There's an abundance of rare wildlife and geological interest, and if we're lucky; otters, red kites, hen harriers, mountain goats, adders and slow worms are a selection of the species we may see.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nCwm Bychan:\nMeaning the '\nsmall valley' ,\nthis gorgeous area is a mix of rivers, woodland and lake. Walking through the cwm will give us a good warm up before heading to the higher hills.\nThe Roman Steps Pass:\nAs we leave the cwm, we'll join the erroneously named Roman Steps - the route is actually a medieval packhorse track. The route cuts through some spectacular geological features seen no where else in Eryri, and is a great place to see reptiles basking on the rocks.\nRhinog Fawr:\nAt 720m, our first summit gives great views over the whole national park as well as the Irish Sea to the West. The mountains steep slopes are popular with the goats, so we may see them here.\nRhinog Fach:\nAt 712m, our second peak is everybit of rugged as the first, and summiting will be a good test of endurance, deep into the walk. Once on the summit we'll be greeted with more fantastic views, including the spectacular view back to Rhinog Fawr.\nLlyn Hywel:\nAs we return back from the mountains, we'll pass the beautiful Llyn Hywel, a natural lake with great views back to the mountain. The fish is home to wild trout and the cliffs by the llyn are home to some of the birds of prey that live in the range.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility.

The Stray is Harrogate's famous open parkland, and the course is three and a bit laps around the park.\nThe important bit... This is about personal goals. You run or walk, or run and walk,  at your own pace. Don't be scared that you may be slower than other people. Some walk, some run, some jog, some do a combination of all three. Just taking part and doing something productive on a Saturday morning is what it is all about!\nTo take part in a parkrun and get your official time,\nyou will need to have\nregistered\nto receive your all important barcode\n.\nYou will need to bring a hardcopy of this barcode with you, or have it digitally available on your phone, if you want an official time.\nParkrun events are run nationwide and indeed internationally, so once you're signed up you can attend anywhere. Be warned though - it's addictive! I tried it once \"just to see\" and have now done over 100, in three different countries..\nThe official start of the run is 9am and we will meet at 8:40 for a quick catch up and attend the run briefing. Look for the red ODL flag that I'll attached to me somehow!\nThe official course event page is on the\nparkrun website here.\nIf you want to join the OutdoorLads' national group on the Parkrun website, on your Parkrun account select Profile, then groups and type \"Outdoorlads (UK)\" and click the Join button.\nIt's not the leader's local parkrun - I'm being a tourist too!\nIf visiting the area, there is an\nOutdoorLads social\nin the evening and if you are a leader, there is a North-East and Yorkshire\nleaders meeting starting at 11am\n.\nYou may also wish to sign up to the\nStrava OutdoorLads running club:\nhttps://www.strava.com/clubs/439735\nPhotos: By L Russell and W Allaway and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Consider this maybe as more of a day out rather than just another walk!\nCome join our trip from Essex to Suffolk and back, including a return boat trip* to a lovely coastal peninsula, around which we will do a 10.6 mile (17km) walk. Much of it is through part of the Suffolk and Essex Coast Heaths national landscape and we'll be taking in two estuary rivers.\n(*Please note there is a charge of £15 per person payable for this event to cover the cost of the return boat trip needed to get to and from the Peninsula. The usual non-subscribed walk event fee of £12.50 will not be charged in addition for this event)\nOur day will commence initially on the Essex coast in the historic maritime port town of Harwich. Originating in the 13th Century, this is now the second busiest ferry and freight port in the UK. We however, will be embarking on a very much smaller craft (as pictured) from the quiet little Harwich Half Penny Pier Harbour for a 10-minute trip across the water to the Suffolk coastal Shotley Peninsula.\nFrom the attractive Shotley Point Marina, we'll then commence our circular walk. Initially heading along the harbourside and onto the outskirts of the small town of Shotley Gate, we'll then follow the banks of the Estuary River Stour. We'll follow the path as it meanders along the estuary banks until we head off across some lovely open Suffolk countryside across to the other side of the peninsula.\nWe'll then arrive at the small village of Chelmondiston - from where we'll head through some scenic low undulating woodland to get to the very pretty and rural estuary hamlet of Pin Mill. Aside from being a very cute place, Pin Mill is known best for its pub on the little quayside: The Butt and Oyster.\nOf course, we'll make a stop here to take in quayside views and some liquid refreshment. The pub is quite small and very popular for food, so eating there wouldn't be practical for us sadly, but we'll find somewhere in the vicinity to also enjoy our packed lunch.\nOnce refuelled, we'll make out way through the beautiful area known as the Cliff Plantation which, as the name suggests, is an old plantation woodland on some low-level cliffs alongside the Estuary River Orwell. Through the trees, there are glimpses of the water and some interesting wooden houseboats as we walk along the riverside path.\nThe continuing estuary side route then takes us on some boardwalks and paths with wide open views of the Estuary River Orwell. As we get closer back to our start point, there are impressive views of the busy Felixstowe Shipping Port across the other side of estuary, creating a unique mix of the rural path we'll be on with the industrial container port across the water.\nAs we arrive back at Shotley Point, we’ll wander through much more of the marina this time with great views of the boats and harbour activity.\nDepending on timings, we should then have time for another refreshment stop at a bar in the marina before we catch our return boat trip back across to Harwich.\n*Note - the high-level view photos of the Marina and the Butt and Oyster Pub setting are drone shots. But nevertheless, the views we'll get on the walk are lovely!\nIs it dog friendly?\n4 legged friends are welcome and are allowed on the boat crossing if you're happy to take them onboard, Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

As we reach the ridge, we will benefit from beautiful views across Guisborough and on towards Hartlepool. We will enjoy some time at Highcliff, before descending towards a more exposed area of moorland. Here we will pass Roland’s Close, the remains of five iron age circular huts, probably dating from early in the 1st century AD. They are named after their excavator who died in 1978 and are the sole example of their kind in North-East Yorkshire.\nAs we walk on, we pass through an exposed area of open moorland, home to sheep, black headed gulls and other wildlife. This part of the walk has no shade, so if it’s a hot day, please ensure that you have sun cream, a hat and plenty of water.\nWe descend through trees and farmland, before reaching the grand finale. The majestic remains of Guisborough Priory, that dates from the 12th century, will tower above you as we walk back towards Guisborough.\nAfter the walk, there will be an opportunity for a drink at Cookfellas courtyard garden, before we head home.\nView the\nOS Map of the planned walk\n.\nDogs: Well-behaved and under-control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request.\nIf this event is fully booked:\nPlease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event:\nIf this is your first event, we’ll make sure you feel welcomed.

The walk follows sections of the Oxfordshire way with gentle rolling hills, woods, stretches alongside the river Evenlode, in an area that was the inspiration for Tolkien's Hobbitshire.\nThe Sights:\nTolkien's Hobbitshire:\nJ.R.R. Tolkien’s vision of The Shire in\nThe Hobbit\nand\nThe Lord of the Rings\nwas inspired by the rural landscapes of Oxfordshire, where he lived and taught at Oxford University. The rolling hills, woodlands, and villages, especially areas like Wychwood Forest, Charlbury, and the Evenlode Valley, influenced his depiction of Hobbiton.\nThe Oxfordshire Way:\nis a 68-mile long-distance walking trail across Oxfordshire, starting at Henley-On-Thames, going through the Chiltern Hills and ending at Bourton-on-the-Water. We will follow a stretch from Kingham to Shipton-under-Wychwood.\nKingham:\nis renowned for its honey-toned stone cottages and tranquil village green. It was named \"England’s Favourite Village\" by\nCountry Life\nmagazine in 2004. We won't see the village centre during this walk, but if you arrive early then feel free to explore (it's over 1 mile away from the station though).\nBruern Abbey:\nbegan as a Cistercian monastery in 1157, but now a Georgian manor house sits on the former abbey site. Today it's a specialist school for boys with learning difficulties.\nShipton-under-Wychwood:\nonce part of the Royal Forest of Wychwood, and features a 12th-century church, a successful cricket club and access to nature reserves including Wychwood Wild Garden and Bould Wood.\nAscott-under-Wychwood:\nknown for its medieval castle remains, 13th-century Holy Trinity Church, and the story of the Ascott Martyrs — 16 women jailed in 1873 for supporting striking farm workers.\nCharlbury\nis a market town known for its Saxon origins and medieval market charter from 1256. It was once a centre for glove-making and has a strong Quaker heritage. The town sits on the edge of the ancient Wychwood Forest, has a museum and hosts the popular Riverside Festival and the World Aunt Sally Championship!\nThe route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Kingham Railway station, we will shortly cross a river and briefly enter Gloucestershire and the village of Bledington. Here we will pick up the Oxfordshire Way, which we will follow for much of the route, following the River Evenlode through fields and woodland. We will see the ruins of Bruern Abbey on the other side of the river. At the village of Shipton-under-Wychwood we will stop for lunch. After lunch we will continue onto the village of Ascott-under-Wychwood where we have the option of a pub stop for a drink. We then cross the railway line and river and follow the Oxfordshire Way from the other side through an area of open pasture and woodland. Eventually we will see the church tower of Charlbury in the distance and the final section takes us through the centre of Charlbury where we will finish the walk, and from here it's a short 5-10 minute walk to the railway station,\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead.

    "Summary": "Come and join us as we march with\nPRIDE\nthrough the streets of Southampton, under Southampton Bargate and up Southampton high street, raising the profile of Outdoorlads not only in Southampton but also the wider south east region.\nIt is especially important to get as many OutdoorLads on the march as possible as this will be the first ever time OutdoorLads has participated in Southampton Pride. Considering the socials and walks that are held in and around Southampton I'm sure most will agree its important our presence is felt and our profile is raised.\nSouthampton's first Pride event was held in 1992, and was known as Solent Pride. Since then, in 2016 Southampton held its first Pride event in over a decade. This marked a significant event for Southampton's LGBTQ+ community. Since then Southampton has held a Pride annually, and it has grown to what we see today.\nWe will meet in Queens Park between\n10.30 - 10.45\n.\nThe march will leave Queens Park at\n11.00\nso its important to get there in good time. I would ask, if possible, to wear your red OutdoorLads t-shirts. If you don't have this, wear any other branded OutdoorLads clothing where possible. Of course, you are still welcome to join whatever you wear. Please bring OutdoorLads flags, whistles, rattles, anything to make noise and get us noticed. It is a protest after all! lol. Hopefully, we will be able to provide banners etc.\nThe march tends to last between 30-60 minutes before ending around Guildhall Square, where we will disperse. We may have a stall advertising OutdoorLads further, though this is yet to be determined. There will be performances from various artists on the main stage and a party atmosphere in the square which you are welcome to stay for. There will be other stalls and locals pubs and clubs in the vicinity. Bedford Place which is close by usually has a buzzing atmosphere.\nIt will be a very busy day, and I'm sure many local roads will be closed. I would strongly recommend to catch public transport into town where possible, and leave plenty of time for your journey, both in and out of Southampton.\nIt would be lovely to see as many people there as possible.\nWe will have an ODL stall in Southampton Guildhall. See full details\nhere\n.",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.   We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.  This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat!  Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby.  This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food!  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories!  Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend.  The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.  From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location.  It is much easier to park in the village and walk down.  There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Our starting point at the port of\nAmlwch is the northernmost town in Wales\n, and you’ll also pass the northernmost point of the Wales Coast Path at Llanlleiana Point. The return will be made by bus.\nInitially we will pass the area’s now derelict industry, including crossing the old railway and the old bromine works on Trwyn Costiog that looks like a set for a 1980s Dr Who episode. After Porth Wen, with its ruined brickworks, the path passes down and back up a feature known as Hell’s Mouth. A lookout tower built in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII marks Wales’ most northerly point. We encounter some more industrial ruins, those of the Porth Llanlleiana China works, which add a certain beauty to the landscape. The walk then follows spectacular clifftop paths, before reaching the church at Llanbadrig (translates as Patrick’s Church) as St Patrick was reputedly shipwrecked at the nearby island of Ynys Badrig. This is a church and graveyard with a superb view, and those with an interest in history can pop in to see the early Christian sculpted stone known as the Ichthus Stone.\nFrom Porth Padrig, the final section around Trwyn y Parc and into the fishing port of Cemaes, where the sandy beach makes it popular with tourists, and it’s a perfect place to end before catching the bus back.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved  and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a spooky Halloween weekend in the historic village of Boscastle, with its medieval core and quintessential Cornish harbour.\nThis is one of those weekend when you really want a good autumnal Cornish Haag to really build up the atmosphere and mysticism of the area.\nBoscastle is one of those places where you can feel the history of the smugglers, and pirates and wreckers in every breath you take, steeped in history, with countless authors and artists being inspired by its remoteness and rugged beauty. The hostel itself is next door to the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic so you just know this is going to be an interesting weekend.  You can even experience some spirits of a different kind at the Wellington Inn just around the corner - famous for having 3 ghosts wandering it's corridors....\nWhat's going to happen over the weekend\nFriday Evening:\nArrive, meet the rest of the group and socialise, welcome meeting and chill.  We'll have the usual buffet. Please bring something that can be shared between two or three people.\nSaturday Day:\nAfter breakfast (which is included in the event cost), we’ll have a walk planned heading into the surrounding countryside.\nPlease bring a packed lunch with you and maybe pack a flask for a hot drink if it’s cold.\nOr you can stay in the hostel and relax or take the day to explore the Cornish Coast if you've never visited the area.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax, socialise, and chillout until a Halloween Themed Dinner, included in the event cost.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast, we'll spend our final morning exploring the coast around Boscastle.  There may even be a visit to the nearby Tintagel Castle to the south, birthplace of King Arthur himself....\nAccessibility at Boscastle\nPlease note this hostel has options for anyone with accessibility needs.\nThis hostel includes a ground floor 6 bed dormitory with an accessible en-suite bathroom.  The lounge, dining and kitchen are all located on the ground floor.\nThere is good colour contrast to floor, walls and doorways throughout the building. All public areas, halls, stairs and landings are well lit using a combination of ceiling and wall lights. The corridor flooring is carpet throughout.\nUnfortunately there is no lift in the hostel to the 1st floor.\nIt is unlikely that the group day events over the weekend will be suitable if you have accessibility requirements but please contact the leader to discuss and to suggest alternatives you could do instead of the walks.\n(For anyone wondering - BIG Halloween is having a fallow year in 2025.)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Meet with the rest of the group around the enormous dining table and I'm sure someone will light the wood burner. Dinner will be included but will be simple for those that might not arrive till later (probably jacket potatoes with a range of fillings).\nSaturday Daytime:\nAfter breakfast, it will be time to explore some of the stunning countryside surrounding Llanthony.  Prepare for a climb as no matter which way you look, the site is surrounded by hills and mountains, and we will be going up at least one of these to reach the views from the ridge lines.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax and unwind. A simple dinner will be served and once we've cleared this away the board or card games will probably make an appearance. There's the option to walk the 50m or so to the cellar bar at Llanthony Priory or perhaps just read a book by that wood burner.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast we'll need to clean and tidy the barn, but once everything is packed away there will be an option to head to Longtown (either by foot or by car) for a Sunday lunch before heading home.\nTea and coffee will be available throughout the weekend but you'll need to bring a packed lunch for Saturday and anything else you may want to drink (The Cellar Bar does offer 2 Pint Takeouts of the draft beers)\nDogs:\nDue to the limited social and sleeping spaces this event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South Wales events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWalesNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as\nMonkchester\nbefore taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882.  Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear.

From there we will pass Cambridge United's Abbey Stadium and follow Coldman's Brook, a minor tributary of the Cam, along the edge of Coldman's Common.\nWe will then turn westwards into the suburb of Romsey and pass Cambridge Central Mosque, nominated for the 2021 Stirling Prize for architecture. Heading along the vibrant Mill Road we will cross the railway and enter the Petersfield area, where our route takes us via the leafy Mill Road Cemetery. We will then weave our way between Victorian terraced houses before reaching Parker's Piece, a large open space where the rules of modern football were codified.\nFrom Parker's Piece we will continue via the tree-lined Christ's Pieces and head into the historic city centre. We will pass the Guildhall, Great St Mary's Church and of course King's College Chapel. Crossing to the western side of the river, we will see the famous Mathematical Bridge, before turning northwards along the Backs with its fine views of King's. We will then pass Gonville & Caius, Trinity and St John's Colleges as well as the 12th-century Round Church, inspired by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nThe final section of our walk meanders alongside the Cam past Jesus Green and Midsummer Common. We will make a short detour to the remains of a 13th-century priory before heading back to the river to the Cambridge Museum of Technology. There we will stop for a well-deserved drink at The Engineer's House, a beer garden with a pleasant riverside atmosphere. From there it is an easy stroll along Stourbridge Common back to Cambridge North.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "I have raised the attendance limit on this walk to give guys on the waitlist certainty. I don't anticipate having so many attending on the day of the walk once cancellations occur.\nA manhood or two might well be seen on the isolated naturist beach we'll visit, but Manhood is also the name of the peninsula that stretches south from Chichester to Selsey Bill. It is a strongly horizontal landscape of contrasting blocks of colour. Wide golden wheat fields and broad brown mudflats are backed by big skies, while the regular rows of poplars, the massed masts of yachts and the sporadic spires of churches provide vertical punctuation. Much of the area has been reclaimed from the sea and is drained by the ditches we'll follow, along with the Chichester Canal. The scattered settlements domesticate an expanse so flat that despite walking 17 kilometres, we'll not climb at all.\nThe sights:\nThe Manhood Peninsula:\nThe southernmost part of Sussex and part of the Sussex coastal plain. Bordered to the west by Chichester Harbour and to the east by Pagham Harbour. Its name comes from the Old English\nmaene-wudu\nmeaning \"men's wood\" or \"common wood\", i.e. common land.\nChichester Canal:\nOpened in 1822, its last load was transported in 1906. Runs 4.5 miles (7.2 km) from Birdham to Chichester. Some of its length is still navigable and the towpath is a popular route.\nSidlesham:\nSet among cornfields are half a dozen scattered hamlets, the nicest being Sidlesham Quay beside Pagham Harbour, which looks like a miniature Bosham. We will have lunch here. The historic\nCrab & Lobster\npub has a lovely garden.\nPagham Harbour:\nA glorious, tranquil area of saltmarsh, mudflats, saltings (for salt extraction) and shallow lagoons. Precious for wildlife as it's an SSSI, a Local Nature Reserve and a Ramsar Site. You could see curlew sandpiper and shelduck on the mudflats and long-tailed tit and willow warbler in the hedges.\nChurch Norton:\nJust the chancel remains from an old church, simple C13, with some fine tombs. The setting is the remarkable thing: surrounded by trees and almost on the shore, the leafy, isolated locale is rare on the Sussex coastal strip. The secluded shingle spit nearby is a nudist beach.\nSwimming\nThis walk\ndoes not\ninclude swimming. If you choose to swim, you do so at your own risk as it is not covered by OutdoorLads's insurance.\nThe sea water is always clean as there are no sewage outfalls nearby. You're invited to check the quality at Southern Water's\nBeachbuoy\nsite or at the\nSurfers Against Sewage\nsite.\nThe\nroute\n(please note that this is a linear walk. A bus will take us back to Chichester)\n:\nWe'll leave Chichester by way of the canal and walk along it to Hunston. At Hunston, we'll walk to Hunston Church along Church Lane. We'll then use footpaths to go to South Mundham and use Fisher Lane to Fisher Farm. Further footpaths will take us to Bramber Farm and Honer Farm. We'll then walk around Paghan Harbour to Halsey's Farm and then pretty Sidlesham Quay for lunch. We could also have a drink at the Crab & Lobster pub. Further walking around Pagham Harbour will bring us to the hinge of Pagham Harbour Spit at Church Norton for a break. Footpaths and then a walk along Grange Lane and Rectory Lane will take us to the B2145 and the bus stop.\nGetting the bus back:\nThe No. 51 Stagecoach bus departs for Chichester every 30 minutes (at 33 and 53 minutes past the hour). It takes around 30 minutes to walk from the beach to the bus stop. The fare is £3, payable by any means.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There is sea for them to splash in but little shade. Dogs are permitted at Church Norton Beach but there are no poop bins. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Image credits: Shingle beach south of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View north across Pagham Harbour; Photo ©\nIan Cunliffe\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Leisure pursuits; Photo ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Gate on footpath between Honer Farm and Halsey's Farm: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Breach Pool north of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh at Sidlesham Quay: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bremere Rife with reed bed: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh, Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pagham Harbour: foreshore north of Church Norton: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A Several - one of several: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); and View northwards along the shingle ridge, Selsey East Beach: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). All pictures are copyrighted but are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA 2.0\nand are here attributed to their copyright holders.)",

There are plenty of flights from the UK to get you into the Netherlands on Friday, or you can hop on the Eurostar. I will be staying at\nHostel Den Haag (The Hague),\nwhere you can get a bed in a dorm for a very reasonable price. I\nhave booked to stay Friday 22nd August - Sunday 24th, flying into Amsterdam on Friday 22nd August from Manchester at 14:35 and back to Manchester on the 18:00 on Monday 25th August.\nWe will meet at\n8:45\nat the start of the run\nbetween AV Sparta and Sportcampus,\nI'll be wearing an OutdoorLads t-shirt, and the run starts at 9am. You can register for Parkrun and get your own barcode from\nwww.parkrun.org.uk\nto scan at the end of your run to record your finish time if you wish. However, you do not need to do this to take part in the run if you don't want to.\nCourse Description:\nThe event will take place here: Zuiderpark, Meester P.

    "Title": "Farnham to Frensham: A Tame Walk, but No Wild Swim",
    "Date": "Saturday Aug 10 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "6",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "26",
    "Summary": "Please note the change of date for this walk and cancel if you can't attend on the new date. Frensham Great Pond was closed on the original and rescheduled dates because of an algal bloom, and there is now a rail replacement bus service to Farnham on Sunday 3 August. Sorry for any inconvenience.\nYou might want to pack your trunks along with your lunch for this one. To be honest, the walk, on the pine-forested, bracken-covered, steep-sided knolls of Bourne Woods will neither be that tame, nor the swim, in the sandy-bottomed, lifeguard-supervised, top-rated waters of Frensham Great Pond, that wild. If you'd rather not swim you can enjoy a leisurely lunch break lolling on the sandy beach or visiting the cafés. Bonus features of this walk include the pretty village of Frensham, and the National Trust-protected woods and heaths roundabout, but the centrepiece will be (weather, crowds and blue-green algae permitting) a summertime splash in a superb setting.\nThe sights:\nFrensham village:\nSt Mary's Church dates from 1239 and contains many original features, despite restoration. There is also a large cauldron which allegedly either belonged to the local witch Mother Ludlam, or the fairies.\nFrensham Great Pond, Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Commons:\nThe lakes are 12th-century fishponds created for the Bishop of Winchester. The Commons that surround them are important SSSIs, home to Dartford warblers, sand lizards and nightjars, and managed by the National Trust. In World War II the ponds were drained, but they were subsequently restored and became a popular spot for London daytrippers in the past and the film and TV industry forever since (for example\nCarry on Jack\n(1963),\nCarry on Columbus\n(1991) and\nThe Mummy\n(1999), doubling as the River Nile). Waverley District Council run a café and toilets next to the Great Pond where the swimming takes place.\nBourne Wood:\nSilver birches and pines cloak a knoll in which a clearing affords lovely views over Farnham and surrounding woodland. Here, the Forestry Commission and RSPB have to balance the needs of nature, recreation and, notably, the UK film industry as it is frequent film and TV location (including\nTenko\n,\nIt Ain't Half Hot Mum\n,\nGladiator\n(2000) (where it stood in for the forests of Germania), various\nHarry Potter\ns,\nWar Horse\n(2011),\nThor: The Dark World\n(2013) and\nNapoleon\n(2022). See\nhere\nfor a list of films shot here.\nSwimming at Frensham Great Pond:\nSwimming isn't compulsory or prolonged and it will coincide with our lunch break. The two designated swimming areas are not large, or deep, but are enough to cool off. The water is clean-smelling and slightly silty. The water quality, regularly sampled, is generally rated 'Excellent' or 'Good' but after prolonged spells of warm weather blue-green algae can bloom and preclude swimming. I will, of course, monitor the situation.\nDogs are not permitted on the beach but can go near the café and walk through the site.\nIn very warm weather the pond and adjacent beach gets busy and people are warned to stay away as the car park closes (which won't affect us). We will see how we feel about the situation on the day. Check for more details\nhere\n.\nDogs\nI love having dogs on my walks, and this is a good dog walk as there is little livestock to be encountered, abundant heathland over which the dog can run free and trees to provide shade. However, there will be some roads to cross and short stretches of road walk along. Furthermore, dogs are not permitted on the beach at the pond and hot weather could be exhausting for them.\nThe route\n(please click the link\nhere\n)\n:\nA range of pleasant and prosperous suburban streets will lead us through The Bourne, Shortheath and Boundstone (in short, the southwestern suburbs of Farnham) to Rowledge. Switchback Lane will take us to Frensham Heights School and a lane will take us east to Broomfield Lane to Shortfield Common. Footpaths heading south will take us to Frensham village and then Frensham Common. Bearing east after lunch, we'll walk from the Great Pond to the Little Pond. We'll then head northeast to cross the River Wey and cross The Reeds Road. We'll head northwest across Farnham Heath and Bourne Wood and go through Lower Bourne along suburban streets back to the station.\n(Images credits: The beach, Frensham Great Pond; Sandbank, Frensham Common; and Sandy tracks, Frensham Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nAlan Hunt\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Path into Bourne Wood and Path on Tankersford Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Small Ford on Grange Road:\nPhoto\n©\nNigel Mykura\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Little Pond view from the west side:\nPhoto\n©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

With panoramic views across Weymouth and Portland to the south and Dorchester and surrounding areas to the north. Walking along the chalk down then down through the valley back to Dorchester.\nThe massive ditches and banks of Maiden Castle, stretching across a saddle-backed hilltop 914 metres long, are the end result of many centuries of modification and enlargement during the Iron Age.\nThe first early Iron Age (800–550 BC) hillfort enclosed only the eastern end of the hill, with a single rampart and a V-shaped ditch. The original rampart was probably dumped earth, stone and chalk from the ditch, but a complex timber revetted wall flanked the two entrances.\nIn the middle Iron Age (550–300 BC), a much larger area of 19 hectares was enclosed including the western end of the hill, allowing more people to live within the defences.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Chris for an 9.5-mile (15 km) walk starting in Louth, often referred to as the \"Capital of the Wolds.\" This historic market town provides a great introduction to the surrounding countryside and features the striking spire of St James’ Church—the tallest of any parish church in the UK. For those who fancy a challenge at the start, we’ll climb the 199 steps to the top of the spire (entry £3.50) for panoramic views across the Wolds.\nThe route then passes through Hubbard’s Hills, a wooded valley with a stream and footbridges, before heading out into the Wolds, taking in the rural landscapes around Welton Vale. Here, you’ll spot the Whale Bone Arch—a curious and unexpected landmark with maritime origins, tucked into the landscape as a nod to seafaring history.\nFrom there, we continue through South Elkington, where the 15th-century All Saints Church stands above the village among mature trees, offering views across open countryside. We’ll take a short break at The Shop—a small local spot serving tea, coffee, and ice cream—before making our way back to Louth.\nAfter the walk, we’ll head to the Greyhound Inn for a well-earned drink or bite to eat.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is in\nHorncastle\n, just 13 miles (22 minutes) away.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This 11 mile / 18km walk starts in Winster, an old lead mining village - once most prosperous - the main street is all 18th Century and contains several fine buildings, including the Hall (built in 1628) and the 16th Century Market House.\nFrom Winster we stroll downhill for a while before climbing onto Stanton Moor, here we see a total contrast in vegetation - now mainly open heather moor with a scant covering of birch. Stanton Moor, a finger of gritstone amid limestone country, rises to 1,060 feet (323m) and is open, breezy, heather clad moorland giving glorious views across the valley of the Derwent. It's two chief characteristics, are the curious rock formations and the vast number of prehistoric remains - burial chambers, standing stones, circles and fortifications - that litter the moor.\nAfter circumnavigating the moor, our descent takes in the old quarry village of Birchover. We continue from here along a combination of tracks and field paths on the approach to the gritstone tor of Robin Hood`s Stride. Cratcliffe Tor can be found nearby. At its foot, we find the Hermit`s Cave, notable for the 12th Century crucifix carved into the rock.\nMore field paths, a stroll down a quiet lane, then a short, sharp climb, lead us to Elton, an attractive village of stone cottages. We finish off by following the Limestone Way back to Winster.\nWalk Highlights:\nstone circle known as Nine Ladies, Robin Hoods Stride, Winster, Birchover, Elton, Cratcliffe Tor and Hermits Cave.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Whether you're a regular or new to OutdoorLads, come along, show your pride, and enjoy a fun day of community, visibility, and adventure. All are welcome—let’s make it a day to remember! York Pride Parade is one of the longest in the country at 2.4 miles, and takes around 60-90 minutes to complete, so please wear appropriate comfortable footwear.\nThe parade ends at the Pride Festival site on Knavesmere, where you will be free to do what you want. There will be live entertainment on the Main Stage, a Cabaret Stage that has numerous local acts and usually some celebrity to headline with going on until about 7.00pm, Pride Market stall, plenty of food and drink vendors and even a fun fair. You can also bring your own food and drink if you want to make a picnic of it. It is a free event, but you can support it by buying a wristband.\nThere are usually a couple of after parties in the town centre and even a club night if you're up to it. (I probably won't stay after about 5.30pm, but I expect it'll be fairly busy in town ). More information can be found on York Pride website and FB pages.\nFrom the Knavesmire it's just 15 minutes walk back to York station.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent.\nWhat to expect;\nYou will be camping within a small defined area with other newbies with a central gazebo.\nA couple of our leaders will be camping with you, happy to help put up tents, answer any queries and be a welcoming face to OutdoorLads.\nOn arrival on the Friday, there will be welcoming drinks and nibbles within the gazebo.\nYou will have access to the gazebo throughout the weekend.\nThough the leaders welcoming duties end on the Friday, the gazebo will become a focal point through out the weekend, with members often cooking and chatting throughout the weekend.\nYou will need to sign up for the\nBIG Summer Camp\nevent page first.",

This is a 2 man tent with a comfortable sleeping mat. You will need to bring a sleeping bag or other sleeping medium. You will need to collect the tent on arrival at registration - it is very easy to put up. Whilst it is a two man tent, be aware that is actually is quite small and if there are two people in it, it will be very cosy!\nAt the end of the event, all we ask is that you please take the tent down and pack it away as you received it, returning it to the bar room upstairs.\nPhotos: Provided by and used with permission from OutdoorLads Members.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It's a beautiful area and over the weekend we can do some great hikes, relax and have a few beers around the campfire.\nOur venue for the weekend is a little village not far from the pretty town of Dartmouth, with miles of the stunning South West Coast Path stretching out in either direction. It's a perfect spot for hiking, chilling, and exploring.\nOn Saturday and Sunday we'll probably hike along the coast. Expect plenty of up and downs but also some spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way, with wooded valleys, rocky coves and stunning beaches including Slapton Sands and Blackpool Sands.\nThe spacious campsite was once used as an airfield by American marines to practice for the D-Day landings. Sadly the marines have long gone, but the campsite is in a great spot and we'll have our own field just for us! There's toilets, hot showers (20p for 5 mins), a small kitchen (with fridge) and washing up sinks. Camp fires and BBQs are allowed providing they are off the ground.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on the campsite but will need to be on a lead. Dogs are £1 a night, payable directly to the site on arrival. Well behaved OutdoorLads too please...this isn’t a party event and we'll need to be quiet after 11pm (the owners are super strict about this).\nThere's a couple of pubs a short stroll away and Slapton Sands beach is a further ten minutes down the road.  There’s a clothing optional beach too, if that’s your thing.\nPhotos:\nAll photos from OutdoorLads Members and permission is given for use by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Please note the date change from 7 June to 9 August.\nJoin me on this spectacular circular walk from Lewes around the South Downs. After a steepish climb near the start, the walk offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and beyond.\nWhen I led this walk in 2023, it was a very hot day, and the majority of us ran out of water. Fortunately we found a water tap in a local church yard. Hopefully it will be cooler this time, but do remember your water!\nWhat is SE500 Challenge?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nPlaces\nof interest\nLewes\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nSouth\nDowns\nNational\nPark\nThis is England's newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010, covering an area of 1,627 square kilometres (628 sq miles) and stretches for 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.\nOffham\nPronounced \"Oaf-um\", the \"new\" St. Peter's Church was built to replace the Church of Old St. Peter in 1840s. Offham hosts two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Clayton to Offham Escarpment and Offham Marshes.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\nWe leave delightful Lewes and pass over the railway line and A27 to pick up Jugg's Road (track) which we follow past the windmill at Kingston Hollow. With a steepish climb of 197m, we're graced with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the South Downs. After passing under the railway and over the A27 again, we climb Long Hill, where we'll stop for lunch, enjoying views of the surrounding countryside. We'll continue over Balmer Down and along the South Downs Way, before starting our gradual descent to the village of Offham. The walk then follows the River Ouse, and the outskirts of Lewes, climbing towards the castle before descending past The Fifteenth Century Bookshop and the quaint houses along Keere Street, and back to the station.\nPlease join me if you wish, for a drink at The Depot, next to the station.\nPlease note, the walk does not allow time to visit Lewes Castle.\nDogs\n:\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and be prepared for a couple of stiles/hills on the walk. Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nIMPORTANT\n! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a day at the seaside with a 9.5 mile walk on the North Essex Coast.\nPlease only book on if you know you can make it.  Members are missing out on places due to people booking on then booking off a few days before.\nThis circular walk starts in the genteel little town of Frinton-on-Sea. This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

Other outdoor event leaders may book on to this course, but those required to complete the training will be prioritised should a waitlist develop.\nThis 16-hour outdoor first aid course deals with issues involved with the long term care of casualties in a remote setting. It is often referred to as a wilderness first aid or a remote first aid.\nThe outdoor first aid course includes primary and secondary surveys of a casualty, we also look at first aid equipment and how you may adapt and improvise your own equipment to support your first aid kit.\nA lot more emphasis is placed on incident management and relaying information to rescue teams in the outdoors. We assume minimal outdoor equipment is available and there are plenty of opportunities to practice first aid.\nThis 2 day (16 hour) course is recognised by the National Governing Bodies such as the Mountain Leader Training, British Canoe Union, British Cycling, British Association of Snowsport Instructors etc.\nEvent cost\nTo help us ensure that those that book on to this event are committed to it, we're asking Leaders to pay £15. This payment will be refunded in full once attendance on the course is confirmed after the event. If you cancel before the event and we can fill your place, you will be refunded in full, but otherwise your booking on this event is subject to the\nOutdoorLads refund policy\n.\nOutdoorLads will subsidise your course fee, you are responsible for your own travel, food and accommodation costs. The course lasts for two days, starting early each morning and finishing in the evening each day and you are required to attend both days.\nPlease note that places on this are for leaders, and those who have already applied to become leaders.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington. Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn.\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1:\nPublic Domain\n; Image 2-4: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 5: Bridlington Sea Front\n© Nicholas Hutton and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n.",

An alternative is to bypass the section on a quieter and less-trafficked, but still steep (down) in places country lane.  We can decide on the day what we'd prefer.\nPateley Bridge is the perfect place to stop for a cream tea, and to refuel for the next climb. It's also the home of the\nOldest Sweet Shop in the World\n- super sour fizz balls, anyone?  The road out of town leads to\nBrimham Rocks\n, a National Trust-owned property with weird and wonderful rock formations we may briefly cycle through.\n8km further on we cycle through the grounds of the stunning\nFountains Abbey\nWorld Heritage Site - a stunning assembly of history: the ruined Cistercian abbey, the landscape gardens, the medieval deer park before reaching\nRipon\n, where we'll stop for lunch. (A 10km shorter route bypasses Fountains Abbey and Ripon, with lunch in Bishop Monkton instead - we'll decide before we set off which route to take).\nAfter lunch the Way of the Roses meanders down the Ouse River valley, along quiet country lanes before crossing the Ouse on the rickety Aldwark Toll Bridge, which is free for cyclists.  The route is almost entirely flat between Ripon and York, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n98km (61 miles) with 890m (2,919ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(Shorter route on\nCycle.Travel here\n).\n**\nYou will need to book your own accommodation in York, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in York.  Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn City Centre (Layerthorpe).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL; Image 6: Aldwark Toll Bridge\n© Andrew Whale and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; all other images Pixabay Public Domain.",

    "Summary": "The\nWay of the Roses\nis a three-day 'coast-to-coast' linear road cycling event.\nThe Wars of the Roses were a series of dynastic civil wars in the 15th Century fought for control of the throne of England between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster, represented by a red rose, and the House of York, represented by a white rose.\nThe 280km / 175 mile\nWay of the Roses\ncycle\nroute is almost entirely on quiet roads and tarmac paths, from the Irish Sea through the valleys of Lancashire, the Yorkshire Dales and the lovely, but little-visited Yorkshire Wolds, to the North Sea coast at Bridlington.\nTradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the Irish Sea and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the North Sea at the finish.\nWay of the Roses Day 1 - Morecambe to Grassington - 84km (52 miles)\nWay of the Roses Day 2\n- Grassington to York - 98km (61 miles)\nWay of the Roses Day 3\n- York to Bridlington / Flamborough - 94km (58 miles) / 102km (63 miles)\nOur journey starts in Morecambe, home to the UK's largest tidal estuary, Morecambe Bay. We'll meet on the seafront at the Way of the Roses start / end sign for the obligatory photo, before setting off for the east coast.\nAlthough called the\nWay of the Roses\n, only 19 miles (30km) of the 175-mile (280km) route is in the red rose county of Lancashire, before it heads into white rose Yorkshire. We skirt the top of the\nForest of Bowland\n, perhaps making a quick side trip to see the\nGreat Stone of Fourstones\n, before stopping for a pub lunch in Clapham or\nSettle\n.\nAny coast-to-coast route is going to involve some hills.  The good news is that the Way of the Roses is much kinder than many routes.  However, the climb out of Settle is crazy steep . . . and cobbled.  But it’s also pretty short; the main action is over in half a mile, after which you can take in the views of the Yorkshire Dales.\nWe head further east through the Dales before finishing up in Grassington, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n84km (52 miles) with 1,200 (3,609ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as a lot of the distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n.\n**\nYou will need to carry all your kit and book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in and around Grassington.  Skip plans to stay at the Old Hall Inn in Threshfield (1.5km outside Grassington).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should any arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1, 4, 5 and 6: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 2: First Way of the Roses Waymarker ©\nAntiquary\nand licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; Image 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL.",
