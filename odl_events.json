    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "9",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "16",
    "Summary": "A tiny detour to Guildford Castle will show us the route for day's walk, map-like, from the top of the keep. The quiet flow of the River Wey and a gentle climb will bring us to St Catherine’s Hill, where we’ll pause to take in more views. From there, we’ll continue to the remarkable Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery for lunch, tea and cake. As we walk over the Hog's Back, and the A3 back toward town, the clean lines of Guildford Cathedral will rise ahead and we'll savour its internal serenity after its external monotony. We could finish with a swim at the newly refurbished Guildford Lido, a cool end to a warm day. We’ll walk, talk and gawk, and make the most of late summer’s lethargic loveliness.\nThe sights:\nGuildford Castle:\nSituated on a small but prominent chalk hill, Guildford Castle was likely built by William the Conqueror around 1066–1086. Originally a motte-and-bailey design, the stone keep was added in the C12. The well-maintained grounds, including vibrant flower displays and panoramic views, lend considerable charm. Tickets to ascend the keep and view the view are £5, and entrance is optional.\nRiver Wey Navigation at Guildford:\nCompleted in 1653, the River Wey Navigation was one of England’s earliest navigable rivers. Engineered by Sir Richard Weston, it connected Guildford to the Thames at Weybridge, transforming Guildford into a trading hub. The towpaths, locks, and converted mills remain key heritage features.\nSt Catherine’s Hill, Guildford:\nThe hill rises to the south of Guildford and is crowned by the remains of St Catherine’s Chapel, a C14 pilgrimage site. The hill provides sweeping views of the River Wey and surrounding countryside. The chapel ruin, likely built of local Bargate stone, is modest but evocative.\nWatts Gallery – Artists’ Village:\nLocated in Compton the Watts Gallery is dedicated to the work of George Frederic Watts (1817–1904), a celebrated Victorian painter and sculptor. Opened in 1904, the purpose-built Arts and Crafts-style gallery was designed by architect Christopher Hatton Turnor. The surrounding 'Artists’ Village' includes studios, gardens, and the Watts Chapel. The gallery houses an impressive collection of symbolist, allegorical and portrait art. An exhaustive visit takes two hours at least, so we'll do the garden, the shop, and the café where light lunches can be bought.\nWatts Mortuary Chapel and Cemetery:\nDesigned by Mary Watts (1849–1938) and built between 1896 and 1904, the Watts Chapel is a masterpiece of the Arts and Crafts Movement. It combines Romanesque, Celtic, and Art Nouveau influences in a richly symbolic, red-brick structure. Local villagers helped create its detailed reliefs and decorations under Mary Watts’s guidance. The adjoining cemetery includes George and Mary Watts’s graves and other notable interments such as that of the author Aldous Huxley. I find the interior oppressive and sickly, but not in a deliciously decadent Viennese fin-de-siècle way. That said, it is unique and quite remarkable.\nGuildford Cathedral:\nPerched on Stag Hill, Guildford Cathedral is a rare C20 Anglican cathedral, designed by Sir Edward Maufe and constructed from 1936 to 1961, interrupted by World War II. Built with what Pevsner called a 'sweet-tempered, undramatic curvilinear gothic' style in red brick and Portland stone, its form is restrained and monumental. Though often considered austere, the interior reveals serenity and elegance. Highlights include the Lady Chapel, the font by William Wilson, and contemporary artworks such as the recently-completed sculpture on the west front. Opinions on its beauty vary, but its architectural coherence and symbolism are notable. What is disappointing is the absence of landscaping and the dreary suburban road leading up to it, the one that Gregory Peck and Lee Remick's characters brought their squirming and screaming stepson Damien up to attend a wedding in\nThe Omen\n(1976). Watch\nhere\n.\nDapdune Wharf:\nA former industrial hub on the River Wey Navigation, Dapdune Wharf was home to the Stevens family’s barge-building operations from the C17 through the early C20. It’s now a National Trust site, preserving workshops, dry docks, and historic barges.\nGuildford Lido:\n(Optional, and at the end of the walk)\n'A refreshing outdoor escape in Stoke Park: Guildford Lido boasts a historic 50 m\nheated\npool set amid 4.5 acres of landscaped gardens. With weekend winter swims, accessible facilities, fun water slides, and art‑deco charm, it consistently draws 90,000 annual visitors—perfect for family fun or peaceful laps alike' (from Wikipedia). The lido dates from the 1930s and was refurbished in 2024.\nGuildford High Street:\nA visually striking and historically rich thoroughfare, lined with buildings spanning from the C16 to C19. Its standout feature is the 1683 Guildhall, with an ornate projecting clock and baroque façade. Other key structures include Holy Trinity Church (1769), Abbot’s Hospital (1619), a Jacobean almshouse, and Tunsgate Arch. The street mixes Georgian symmetry with Tudor timber-framing, making it one of the most picturesque town centres in England.\nThe swim:\nThe swim at Guildford Lido (so permissible as patrons are covered by the pool's insurance) will take place at the end of the walk, is optional, and involves a total of an extra two kilometres to the pool and back. The pool is spacious (50m long) and heated. A swim costs £9.98. Book\nhere\nif you're interested in doing this.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There will be some woods but little shade otherwise, plus a lot of urban walking. Dogs are not permitted at the pool, of course, but could run in the adjacent park. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n:\nSave for a small detour to see the castle, we'll walk south and southwest along the Wey South Path before picking up the North Downs Way (NDW) to head west to Compton and the Watts Gallery where we'll have lunch, but before that, we'll do a loop south then west along a footpath at West Warren Wood. Picking up the NDW again. Re-entering West Warren Wood, will pick up a footpath ascending the Hog's Back to go to Sunnydown. We'll head further north, cross Farnham Road (the A31), then head northeast along High View Road. Using a footbridge, we'll cross over the A31 and use a footpath to go to the University of Surrey's Research Park. Daphne Jackson Road, Gill Avenue, Egerton Road will take us east to the Cathedral. We'll head east along Union Hill through the university to cross the railway line, which is where those not going to the lido will leave us. Yorkies Bridge and Walnut Tree Close will take us the the River Wey. Woodbridge Road, Stocton Road and Lido Road will take us to the lido. After the swim, Stoke Road and Chertsey Street will take us to the top of the High Street which we'll use to go back to the station.\n(All images were taken by the leader on his recce in August 2025. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "Distance is 16.5 km (10 miles); total ascent is 301 m; relief is hilly; terrain is dirt, grass and tarmac. If you don't want to go to the lido at the end, the total distance would be 13.5 km (8.5 miles).",

    "Summary": "With 2000 years of history (sextons found Roman remains digging graves in St George's Cemetery), five centuries of architectural innovation, around ten architectural styles, and a reputation for radical, intellectual, affluential and regal characters, Bloomsbury is a fascinating area in London's West End. The architectural diversity has jeopardised the area's character, with modern and brutalist designs being built not just on bombsites but where Georgian and Victorian buildings were wilfully demolished, but despite this, the district is still known for its numerous elegant Georgian garden squares, and the brutalist intrusions have improved with age or now seem democratic.\nBloomsbury timeline:\nC1-C4:\nRoman remains show settlement near Londinium.\nC12:\nName 'Blemondisberi' appears, after William de Blemond given land by William I.\nC13:\nEstate passes to Carthusian monks.\n1530s:\nHenry VIII grants the abbey and its land to the station Earl of Southampton.\n1660s:\nBloomsbury begins urban development; Bloomsbury Square laid out.\n1775–1783:\nBedford Square constructed by Thomas Leverton for the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford.\n1800–1804:\nRussell Square designed by Humphry Repton; Tavistock, Gordon and Woburn Squares follow.\n1753-1759:\nBritish Museum founded and opens in Montagu House.\n1823–1852:\nCurrent British Museum building constructed.\n1828-1836:\nUniversity College London and University of London established.\nEarly C20:\nBloomsbury Group meets in Gordon and Tavistock Squares.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll meet outside our first sight, which is...\n1. Russell Square Underground Station\n: Architect Leslie Green, built 1906. Distinctive oxblood-red terracotta façade, iconic of early Underground stations on the Piccadilly Line.\nWe'll then go west along Bernard Street and south down Russell Square to...\n2. Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel:\nOriginally the Hotel Russell; by Charles Fitzroy Doll, built 1898. Lavish terracotta building in French Renaissance style. The four queens sculptures are noteworthy. Said to inspire interiors aboard the\nTitanic\n.\nWe'll then walk around...\n3. Russell Square Gardens:\nLandscaped by Humphry Repton for the Duke of Bedford in 1804. One of London’s largest squares, with fine plane trees and fountains, although some newer buildings (such as the UCL School of Education and the Imperial Hotel, which is being refurbished ) have intruded.\nWe'll then walk south down Montague Street, west along Great Russell Street and south down Museum Street to the A40 and...\n4. Church of St George, Bloomsbury:\nBy Nicholas Hawksmoor, built 1716–31. Eccentric stepped tower or ziggurat topped with a statue of George I as a Roman emperor. Considered one of Hawksmoor’s finest Baroque works. Dramatic and wayward, elephantine at street level, and increasingly delicate as the building ascends.\nWe'll then walk east along the A40 to...\n5. Bloomsbury Square Gardens:\nLondon’s oldest surviving garden square, laid out in the 1660s. Once fronted Southampton House, a Jacobean mansion that gave Bloomsbury its aristocratic roots.\nWe'll then walk east along Theobalds Road and north up Boswell Street to...\n6. Great Ormond Street Hospital\n: Britain’s first dedicated children’s hospital, founded by Dr Charles West in 1852. J M Barrie donated the rights to\nPeter Pan\nin 1929, funding the hospital in perpetuity.\nWe'll then walk east along Great Ormand Street to...\n7. Lamb’s Conduit Street:\nNamed after William Lambe, who funded a water conduit here in 1577 to bring fresh water to Holborn, so a rare Elizabethan survival in Bloomsbury’s urban memory. Today has lively independent shops and cafés.\nAnd then to Millman Street for...\n8. Rugby Tavern:\nA rare survival of a historic pub on Great James Street, dating to the C18. Named for Rugby School, which once owned the land here.\nWe'll walk north up Millman Street, west along Guilford Street and north round Landsdown Terrace to Brunswick Square. We'll walk east from there to the...\n9. Foundling Museum:\nOn the site of Thomas Coram’s Foundling Hospital. Supported by William Hogarth and Georg Frederic Handel. First purpose-built children’s charity hospital in Britain. We'll see the spot where children would be abandoned into the care of the hospital.\nGoing back on ourselves west to Hunter Street, we'll turn east down Handel Street to...\n10. St George’s Gardens:\nLaid out as a burial ground for St George’s Bloomsbury and St George’s Hanover Square, and a rare survival in that it is unchanged. Atmospheric Georgian garden cemetery. Contains the grave of Anna Cromwell, granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\nGoing back down Handel street, westwards, we'll enter the...\n11. Brunswick Centre:\nDesigned by Patrick Hodgkinson from 1966 to 1971. Brutalist 'streets in the sky' development, now Grade II-listed.\nLeaving the Brunswick Centre, we'll be on Marchmont Street, which we'll head north along to find...\n12. 57 Marchmont Street:\nChildhood flat of comic actor and diarist Kenneth Williams, above his father’s barber shop. Marchmont Street retains much of its C19 shopfront character.\nWe'll then walk west down Coram Street and south down Herbrand Street to get to the...\n13. Daimler Garage, Herbrand Street:\nFormer Daimler Car Hire Garage, by Wallis, Gilbert & Partners in 1931. Bold Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design with faience cladding.\nWe'll then go north back up Herbrand Street to Tavistock Place to see...\n14. Mary Ward House:\nA lovely Arts and Crafts design from 1897 by Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Claude Brewer, it supports education, social reform, and community activities. Its architecture features handcrafted brickwork. Mary Ward worked to improve education for the poor, but was a staunch opponent of giving women the right to vote, and in 1908 she became the founding President of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League.\nWestwards around the corner is...\n15. Tavistock Square:\nPart of Bloomsbury’s grid of Georgian terraces. Leads towards Tavistock Square, long associated with writers and reformers. The headquarters of the British medical Association is on the Square. We'll have lunch here in the gardens (or in the Pret opposite).\nWe'll then head further west to...\n16. Gordon Square:\nBuilt in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt as part of the Bedford Estate’s expansion. Its residents gave the Bloomsbury Group its name. Virginia Woolf lived at no. 46, Lytton Strachey, essayist and biographer, also lived in the square as did John Maynard Keynes, the economist and author E.M. Forster and other intellectuals regularly visited,\nAnd see at the corner of the square...\n17. Church of Christ the King:\nDesigned by Raphael Brandon in a Gothic-revival style, chiefly Early English. Now home to various Christian communities but under the Catholic Apostolic Church. Incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a façade), and the spire and full height of its tower are missing. We'll have time to explore.\nWe'll go up Gordon Street, then west along Gower Place, then south down Gower Street to...\n18. University College London:\nBy William Wilkins from 1826–30 who also designed the National Gallery. The neoclassical dome and portico (akin to his design for the National Gallery) were a symbol of progressive, secular education. It was the first English university to admit students regardless of religion, the first in the world to admit women, and the first to have an LGB society (thanks go to Steve Rowett for this information).\nWe'll then turn east along Torrington Place then south down Malet Street to...\n19. Senate House:\nBy Charles Holden (1937), soaring Art Deco limestone tower. Served as the Ministry of Information in WWII and famously inspired Orwell’s 'Ministry of Truth' in\n1984\n. Location for Bertie Wooster's New York apartment in the ITV\nJeeves and Wooster\n.\nWe'll continue down Malet Street to Montagu Place, then go west along it to...\n20. Bedford Square:\nThe most complete surviving Georgian square in London from 1770s. Uniform terraces, once fashionable residences, now mostly academic offices. 'Bedford Square' local lad Kenneth Williams enthused '...this really is what Bloomsbury in its heyday was all about. Lovely rows of Georgian houses surrounding a garden. The garden itself providing an oasis against all the hubbub of urban life and aesthetically pleasing too.'\nAfter going round that, we'll head south along Bloomsbury Street to Great Russell Street and the...\n21. British Museum:\nBy Sir Robert Smirke, 1823-1852. The Greek Revival design is monumental and famous, but rigid. The collections inside are vast, diverse and iconic, yet often criticized for colonial acquisitions and lack of contextual interpretation. Ian Nairn wrote in\nNairn's London,\n'Smirke was under the impression that architecture could be created by wrapping and great number of bionic columns around a big E shaped mass. It is putting together a building from the outside, instead of designing it from a central idea, and it never comes alive for a moment’. You'll get most of the afternoon to browse the museum if you want.\n(Picture credits: British Museum from the NE:\nPhoto\n©\nHam\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); Pediment, The British Museum:\nPhoto\n©\nPhilip Halling\n(cc-by-sa/2.0); Russell Square station, Bernard Street:\nPhoto\n©\nBryn Holmes\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bedford Square by Jeremysm (Public Domain); Hotel Russell, Russell Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Sones\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The cafe in Russell Square:\nPhoto\n©\nRod Allday\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Former Daimler Garage, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nSteve Cadman\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Mary Ward House, Tavistock Place, WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Quinn\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Senate House, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of Christ the King, Gordon Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Osley\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Wilkins Building:\nPhoto\n©\nDiliff\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); St George, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads at Nottingham Climbing Centre\nClimbing evenings are held regularly and we tend to go to the local pub – The Lion for refreshments and a social gathering afterwards where they have a wide variety of beverages both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices. We ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive)\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.00*\n-     Hire a harness (again, if you don’t have your own) - £3.00*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Event Suitability – Intermediate & Experienced Climbing Evening\nThis event is suitable for:\nExperienced Trad climbers.\nClimbers who are ready to take the next step beyond beginner outdoor sessions and gain more experience climbing outdoors in a supportive, low-pressure environment.\nTo attend, you should:\nBe able to\nlead belay confidently\n(If you can't lead belay, message the event leader to confirm whether you can be accomodated based on the experience level of other attendees)\nBe\ncomfortable\nclimbing\nindoor routes graded 5A or above\nBe either already leading trad routes (placing gear) or looking to\nsecond a route\nwith traditional protections outdoors.\nWe’ll typically climb in\npairs or small groups of three\n, depending on the number of attendees and the routes available and will match less experienced climbers with more experienced Trad climbers. Climbing in threes allows more opportunity for rest, observation, and learning.\nWhat is Seconding?\nIf you're\nseconding a route\n, you'll follow the climber who led the route up (see below for explanation on leading), placed gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) and attached the rope to the gear they placed. In a group of three:\nThe\nfirst second\nclimbs the route with the rope already in place, primarily focusing on movement and getting used to the rock. This climber does not remove any gear, but will need to unclip the rope and re-clip as they pass any protection.\nThe\nsecond second\nfollows after and\nremoves the gear\n(nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) that was placed by the leader. This is a vital role and a great way to build an understanding of traditional protection placements.\nSeconding allows you to experience outdoor climbing with less pressure than leading while still engaging with gear and rope systems. It’s an ideal way to build outdoor climbing experience before leading your own routes.\nWhat is Leading?\nThis person goes up the route first,\nplacing protection\nor gear (nuts, cams, quickdraws, etc.) to protect themselves as they ascend.\nOnce they reach the top of the route, the lead climber's job is to:\nBuild a secure anchor\nusing fixed gear (like bolts) or traditional protection (nuts, cams, etc.)\nSet up the system so others can safely climb the route on\ntop rope\n(Not to be confused with top roping indoors)\nAfter the anchor has been built, the role of belaying switches from the person on the ground, to the person who lead the route from the anchor they have built at the top of the climb.\nWhen second climbers ascend the route on top rope:\nThey are protected from above by the rope, so any fall is very short.\nThey climb to the top, and top out rather than being lowered back to the ground.\nThis event is ideal if:\nYou’re a\ncompetent indoor lead climber\nlooking to gain real rock experience\nYou’ve seconded or climbed outdoors before but want to develop further\nYou’re looking to bridge the gap between indoor (or sport climbing) and outdoor trad\nYou’re happy to take turns belaying, seconding, or leading based on the group setup\nThis event is\nnot suitable for absolute beginners\nor anyone who has not yet learned to lead belay.\nIf you’re unsure whether this event is right for your current level, just drop me a message, we may have some flexibility depending on group dynamics and experience levels.\nLocation\nGardoms offers a variety of climbs, and the team will ensure that you both enjoy your Trad Climbing experience but are also challenged. There may also be the opportunity to abseil/rappel down a selected route where a dedicated Group Abseil point will be established.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We'll wander across the Oxon/Bucks border between lovely small villages located along and around the River Thame.\nThe Gardens were originally established as a school for horticulture in the 1930s, with Waterperry House standing since the 17th Century. The Gardens are beautifully kept and well worth a visit, especially in the spring for the snowdrops. There is a small rural life museum, garden centre and tea room attached, but sadly the old farm shop has now gone. There is also an outdoor amphitheatre where they hold opera events. The Waterperry estate apparently used to supply strawberries to Buckingham Palace back in the day!\nWe will walk through the village of Waterperry and make a circuit over the M40 and back again towards Worminghall, and then to Ickford. We then get to Shabbington where we can stop for lunch by the river at the Old Fisherman pub.\nWe will then follow the river course south following the Thame Valley footpath and then we will make a detour to see the Chapel at Rycote, standing since the 15th Century. There is a charge of £8 to go inside the chapel (with some concessions\nhttps://www.rycotepark.com/rycote-chapel-tours-and-opening-times/)\nbut it's impressive enough from the outside also.\nWe will then take the return path back through Albury, Tiddington and Waterstock back to the start. If we get back early enough there might be tea and scones on the lawn, or you may be able to go in and see the gardens for yourself (open until 5.30).\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome to come along but be mindful not everyone likes dogs as much as you might. They will need to be on the lead when we are within the Waterperry estate and at the Rycote Chapel. There are short bits of walking on roads and a few very busy road crossings to be mindful of.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A short stroll out of historic Farnham soon trades cobbled charm for a patchwork of green commons, sandy tracks, and wide water meadows. The River Wey meanders lazily between reed beds, mirroring willows that lean in as if to gossip. Old bridges, neat cricket greens, and clusters of cottages give this walk a gentle, timeless feel — but there’s a dash of variety too, with stretches of heathland, quiet woodland, and open pasture.\nThis will be the lovely\nFelipe Rogatto\n's assessment walk as he ventures to become a Lowland and Hill Walk leader for OutdoorLads. Your support for Felipe is sought.\nThe sights:\nFarnham:\nA handsome Georgian market town with a medieval street plan. Known for its 12th-century castle, built by the Bishop of Winchester, and its elegant shopfronts along Castle Street. The town’s name means “ferny homestead” — an apt start point for a leafy walk.\nThe River Wey:\nOne of southern England’s prettiest rivers, the Wey here flows through low meadows that flood in winter and shimmer with dragonflies in summer. Look out for grey wagtails, herons, and the occasional kingfisher.\nTilford:\nPicture-postcard Surrey. Two greens, two medieval bridges, and one very fine pub. Tilford cricket matches are played on the upper green, with spectators often enjoying a pint at The Barley Mow across the road. The lower green is framed by the twin arches of the 12th-century bridge over the Wey.\nWey Valley Meadows:\nThese protected pastures host wildflowers in spring, including buttercups, cuckooflower, and southern marsh orchids. In summer, swallows skim low over the grass, snatching insects on the wing.\nDogs:\nThis walk is very suitable for dogs. There’s plenty of open space, river access for a drink or paddle, and several fields with livestock (dogs on leads in these areas, please).\nThe\nroute\n(click the link in red to see the route along with the elevation):\nStarting from Farnham Station, we’ll head South and follow field paths and sandy lanes to reach Tilford’s upper green. We’ll stop here for lunch, and get a drink at The Barley Mow. After lunch, we’ll loop back via the lower green and its medieval bridge, rejoining the Wey path toward Farnham. The route is about 17 km (10.5 miles) with some gentle undulations.\nThis is a circular walk returning to Farnham Station, with frequent trains to Guildford and London Waterloo.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an autumnal  hostel weekend near Keswick\nPerched  right at the very top of Honister Pass, overlooking the slate mines, from here you get a sense of remoteness without the difficulty of getting there (easy to drive or even get a bus to!).\nThis is a popular OutdoorLads hostel and this year, we have even managed to be able to offer it at a lower price than last time we were here- winner winner.\nThe hostel is a converted accommodation block from the mines. It's got a large dining / social area with a log burner stove, a decent kitchen, plenty of toilets and hot showers and a great plus- small rooms and no massive dormitory set ups.\nGiven its location in the Lake District it is highly likely the Saturday full day walk on offer with be a mountain one, so plan accordingly. - we are already at a good altitude, but that doesn't mean we are cheating in any way.  Johnny will aim to lead a walk from the hostel, probably taking in Haystacks (Wainwright's favourite!). This of course is only a suggestion as there are almost  too many to choose from. For those looking for a more gentle weekend, there may be a lowland walk available or you are free to do your own things, such as visiting the slate mines next door, or take a short drive to nearby Buttermere, Borrowdale or Keswick. There is even a via ferrata on our doorstep- but that is absolutely NOT part of the ODL weekend.\nThere are 6 parking spaces at the hostel (8 at a tight squeeze), but we can use the large National Trust car park right behind the hostel (free overnight, paid for non-National Trust Members / free for members during the day) - If you're a member, please bring your card and leave the hostel spaces for others!\nThere will be one dog on the event (the leader's). He's happy to be fussed and have tummy rubs- but please, no treats or scraps from your dinners.\nPhotos used with permission of the leader\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is intended for participants at\nBig Summer Camp 2025\nThough a manhood or two might well be seen on the isolated naturist beach we'll visit at the end of the walk, Manhood is also the name of the peninsula that stretches south from Chichester to Selsey Bill. Expect to see wide golden wheat fields and broad brown mudflats broken up by rows of poplars, massed masts of yachts and sporadic spires of churches. Much of the area has been reclaimed from the sea and is drained by the ditches we'll follow, along with the Chichester Canal. The scattered settlements domesticate an expanse so flat that despite walking 17 kilometres, we'll not climb at all.\nThe sights:\nThe Manhood Peninsula:\nThe southernmost part of Sussex and part of the Sussex coastal plain. Bordered to the west by Chichester Harbour and to the east by Pagham Harbour. Its name comes from the Old English\nmaene-wudu\nmeaning \"men's wood\" or \"common wood\", i.e. common land.\nChichester Canal:\nOpened in 1822, its last load was transported in 1906. Runs 4.5 miles (7.2 km) from Birdham to Chichester. Some of its length is still navigable and the towpath is a popular route.\nSidlesham:\nSet among cornfields are half a dozen scattered hamlets, the nicest being Sidlesham Quay beside Pagham Harbour, which looks like a miniature Bosham. We will have lunch here. The historic\nCrab & Lobster\npub has a lovely garden.\nPagham Harbour:\nA glorious, tranquil area of saltmarsh, mudflats, saltings (for salt extraction) and shallow lagoons. Precious for wildlife as it's an SSSI, a Local Nature Reserve and a Ramsar Site.\nChurch Norton:\nJust the chancel remains from the 13th century church. The setting is the remarkable thing: surrounded by trees and almost on the shore, the leafy, isolated locale is rare on the Sussex coastal strip.\nRoute and costs:\nThis is a\nlinear walk\ninvolving a return train to Chichester and a bus from the end of the walk back to Chichester train station. Both have frequent service giving us plenty of flexibility.\nThis walk involves us walking from the site to the local train station, Angermering (1 mile / 20 minutes) to get the 10:06 service to Chichester, arriving at 10:25. An off peak day return is £9.40, though tickets of 3 or more adults get a third off GroupSave discount.\nWe'll leave Chichester by way of the canal and walk along it to Hunston. At Hunston, we'll walk to Hunston Church along Church Lane. We'll then use footpaths to go to South Mundham and use Fisher Lane to Fisher Farm. Further footpaths will take us to Bramber Farm and Honer Farm. We'll then walk around Paghan Harbour to Halsey's Farm and then pretty Sidlesham Quay for lunch. We could also have a quick drink at the Crab & Lobster pub. Further walking around Pagham Harbour will bring us to the hinge of Pagham Harbour Spit at Church Norton for a sunbathe on the secluded beach (swimmers optional - no pressure either way!).\nFootpaths and then a walk along Grange Lane and Rectory Lane will take us to the bus stop (Stop is Selsley, Norton Corner) where the No. 51 Stagecoach bus departs for Chichester every 20 minutes (£3 single fare). We aim to back to the campsite between 5.30pm and 6pm.\n(Image credits: Shingle beach south of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View north across Pagham Harbour; Photo ©\nIan Cunliffe\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Leisure pursuits; Photo ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Gate on footpath between Honer Farm and Halsey's Farm: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Breach Pool north of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh at Sidlesham Quay: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bremere Rife with reed bed: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh, Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pagham Harbour: foreshore north of Church Norton: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A Several - one of several: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); and View northwards along the shingle ridge, Selsey East Beach: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). All pictures are copyrighted but are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA 2.0\nand are here attributed to their copyright holders.)",

    "Summary": "This event is intended for participants at\nBig Summer Camp 2025\n'If we sail eastnortheast by the sun, we should hit the coast somewhere around Littlehampton. I've always wanted to go there. All that lovely sand!'\n(Carry On Jack, 1964)\nIf you've also always wanted to go to Littlehampton (or 'Little 'Ampton' and hence 'LA') like Captain Fearless, or just fancy an easy-peasy, sea-breezy walk to quell the previous night's overindulgence that starts at the camp site, then this is for you. Other reasons why you should come include: tea and cake for elevenses; chips on the Prom for lunch, splendid views all the way from the Isle of Wight to Beachy Head from a hill; a host of examples of domestic architecture from flint cottages to Regency terraces to International Moderne; and, a lounge on the sand mentioned above. Plus, to make it even easier, a bus will return us almost to the campsite for about 4pm, in good time for Sports Day.\nThe sights:\nHighdown Hill:\nA small but isolated promontory off the main South Downs belt, just 81m high but giving great views. In the property of the National Trust and the traditional burial-place of the Saxon kings of Sussex. Late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC) enclosure and early Iron Age (around 600 BC) hill fort. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery with around 90 graves has been excavated. In the C18, local miller John Olliver had his tomb built on the hill 27 years before his death in 1793. It is said that he was the leader of local smugglers and used the tomb to store contraband. He would set the sails of his windmill at different angles to indicate the absence of customs men to his followers out at sea. A runaway millstone from Ecclesden Mill is said to have given its name to a local farm and now garden centre.\nHighdown Gardens:\nTransformed from a chalk quarry by Sir Frederick Stern and his wife between 1909 and 1967, cultivating rare plants collected from expeditions to China and the Himalayas. Lady Stern gifted the gardens to the public in 1968. From 1990 to 1993, the adjoining mansion became the legendary Sterns nightclub, famous for its four themed rooms and 30 kW 'Underground' bunker built into the hillside, hosting pioneering DJs and techno acts such as Moby, The Prodigy, Carl Cox, and Sasha before its closure in 1998. Ravers would get so hot in the main room that their sweat would condense on the ceiling and drip back on to them, a phenomenon called 'Stern's Rain'.\nKingston Gorse:\nA private estate of 'individually designed houses built after 1930 but mostly 1960s or later larger replacements offering a good chance to see many cliches of domestic design' (\nThe Buildings of England - Sussex: West\n(Williamson, Hudson, Musson and Nairn)). Of the three best houses of the Modern Movement, only one is visible: Sea Lane House, 1936-7 by Marcel Breuer with FRS Yorke. Marcel Breuer worked at the Bauhaus where he was mentored by Walter Gropius before working in Britain between 1933 and 1938. His most famous work is the Wassily Chair and he was the lead character in the film\nThe Brutalist\n.\nFerring:\nAn old flint cobble village swallowed up by seaside bungalows, typical of the Sussex coast. The core, by the C13 roughcast church of St Andrew, along Church Lane is quite pretty.\nRustington:\nA quiet and lightly-developed stretch of coast, historically part of a small fishing and farming village mentioned in the Domesday Book. Development accelerated in the late C19 and early C20 centuries with holidaymakers drawn to its wide shingle beach and gentle promenade, but staying in guest houses rather than large hotels.\nLittlehampton - history and topography:\n'Littlehampton' says\nThe Buildings of England - Sussex: West\n, 'is pleasant, but like most West Sussex seaside towns, disjointed. The joy of it is in the landscape of the river and beach. The old town, with its quay, lies on the E bank of the Arun...[and] was a village and minor port. Its further development as port and resort was largely due to investment by the Dukes of Norfolk...Though the 12th Duke capitalized on seaside fever, it was only after the arrival of the direct railway connection in 1863 that the resort expanded significantly.' The East Beach has not held Blue Flag status in recent years but maintains good water quality, abundant facilities and is patrolled by lifeguards in the summer.\nLittlehampton - architecture:\nMewsbrook Park (opened 1939) features Art Deco shelters from the same era. South Terrace and Norfolk Place, laid out in the early C19, reflect Regency resort planning and bring a little of Brighton to the place. Modern redevelopment funded by the Sea Change government investment programme to revitsalise declining seaside resorts includes the riverside promenade, regenerated harbour area, and striking contemporary architecture like the East Beach Café (2005) designed by Thomas Heatherwick, and the curved, timber-clad “World’s Longest Bench” (2010 and 1 km long) along the seafront, which weaves between shelters and playgrounds.\nLittlehampton - comedy connections:\nFor a town of just 13,000 people, Littlehampton seems to punch above its weight culturally, perhaps because it is an English archetype, melding childhood day trips with a faded chintzy charm. Character actor Stanley Holloway (1890-1982) died there; it doubled for Swanage in an episode of\nThe Inbetweeners\n; a short-lived comedy starring John Inman called\nOdd Man Out\nwas set there; Ronnie Barker was inspired to write\nOpen All Hours\nbased on his experiences of living there and using a corner shop; The Littlehampton Libels case gave rise to the film\nWicked Little Letters\nwhich was partly filmed there;\nCarry On Jack\nmakes frequent reference to it; and Paul O'Grady briefly lived and loved there in the early 1980s before starting his career in London (he called it 'a graveyard in the sun').\nSwimming and seawater quality:\nThe beach has recently held a Blue Flag award and there are lifeguards patrolling it. We'll stop for a while on the beach and if you wish, you could go for a swim. However please be aware that this is optional, and as OutdoorLads is not insured for swimming, it is not part of the OutdoorLads event and therefore entirely at your own risk.\nThe most recent bathing water quality at the bathing location was rated 'Good'. The water quality has always been deemed 'Good', but check\nhere\n(Environment Agency) or\nhere\n(Surfers Against Sewage).\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see it)\n:\nWe start by heading north from the campsite near Angmering village centre. Heading east along the High Street, we'll ascend Highdown Hill which we'll descend after seeing the fort ramparts and having had a break at the cafe. After crossing the A259 and railway line we'll briefly head west and southwest through the suburbs of Ferring and cross Ferring Rife to go to Kingston Gorse. We'll then head west along the beach. We'll walk right along the beach shingle and the esplanade, briefly detouring to see the Art Deco shelters and lake at Mewsbrooks Park. After a spell at the beach, we'll walk along the River Arun into town to catch the bus back.\nGetting the bus back:\nThe Stagecoach No. 701 bus departs Littlehampton town centre at 06, 26 and 46 minutes past the hour. It takes 20 minutes to get to Angmering. There is then a 10-minute walk back to the campsite. Payment is £3 by any means. If we catch the 15.26 service, you'll be back by 16.00, in good time for Sports Day at 17.00.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Places Left": "11",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "7",
    "Summary": "At 1550ft above sea level, Skiddaw House is the highest hostel in Britain. It was built around 1829 as a 'Keeper's lodge' and grouse shooting base for George Wyndham, the third Earl of Egremont. The building was originally divided into two separate dwellings; one side for the gamekeeper and his family and the other for a shepherd's family. The Earl and his shooting parties also had a few rooms to stay in when they came to visit. In 1986 the two dwellings were converted into the hostel it is today.\nSkiddaw House operated as a youth hostel from 1987 until 2002, when it closed and began to fall into disrepair again. But with the help of the previous hostel manager, many volunteers and the Skiddaw House Foundation, the hostel was renovated and reopened in 2007. The building retains many original features, which combined with its interesting history and remote location make the hostel a unique place to stay.\nOne of the great features of Skiddaw House is its remote location, offering stunning views of the surrounding Lakeland fells. This venue is an OutdoorLads favourite and is truly special, right from the moment you park up you'll understand why this is so glorious!\nHowever, the remote nature of the hostel means it is lacking the mod cons we may be used to, such as heating. Don't panic, there are a number of open fires throughout the building which helps keep it warm, but the bedrooms do not have any heating. Full bedding of 15tog duvets and pillow are provided but some may prefer to pack their own sleeping bag. Boots are also not allowed to be worn inside so we recommend packing slippers too!\nItinerary\nFriday Afternoon/Evening -\nArrive at the car park for 2:30pm, meet the rest of the group and we will hike up to the hostel together, sharing the load of weekend food supply bags. Please have your head torch handy in case we start to lose the light!  Once we have arrived and found our beds, there will be a briefing and we'll have the usual OutdoorLads buffet so please bring something that can be shared between two people (doesn't need to be complicated).\n(\nImportant note: You need to plan to be there at 2:30pm as we will then hike in together. We won't have scope to come back for stragglers and there is no phone signal at the car park. If you know you won't be able to meet at 2:30pm, please message the event leader before you book to discuss any other possibilities.)\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast will be available.  The main activity will be mountain walks (how many options we can offer depends on how many other mountain leaders book on). With hits like Skiddaw and Blencathra on our doorstep there are excellent options all around.  However we are also looking at the possibility of an (optional) conservation project of some kind in conjunction with the new owners of Skiddaw - more information will follow on this if we are able to arrange something.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop your feet up and unwind from the days activities. We will be putting together a two course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.  While the hostel has a few, if you have a favourite travel size board/card game why not bring it?\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided once more then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am.  Once done we will take everything we brought back to the car park and then people might want to head home, into Keswick for an afternoon touristing, or if there is the demand there could be another walk offered.\nOther information\nBeds:\nThere are two double beds in the hostel (not in private rooms sorry!). Please let the leader know when you book if you are coming with a partner or friend you are happy to share a bed with, so that we can enable as many people as possible to join this weekend.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nSkiddaw House requires a 1 hour hike to access it from the car park. To ensure everyone arrives safely we ask that all attendees meet at the car park for 2:30pm Friday so that we can hike up together. You will need to carry everything you need for the weekend including food and drink, in one trip - so pack light!\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "We’ll step off the train at Battle Railway Station into the mellow gold light and bonfire-scented air of a late-October morning. We'll join the 1066 Country Walk trail (see the entire route\nhere\n), heading north through gentle fields before entering Great Wood, a sprawling remnant of the ancient Wealden forest. Here, towering oaks and sweet chestnut will stand in a blaze of copper and amber, their leaves carpeting the paths, while nuthatches and squirrels busy themselves with the season’s bounty.\nThe trail will lead us through rolling countryside towards Westfield, a village with roots in the Domesday Book. St John’s Church, rebuilt in 1815 on medieval foundations, will stand at the heart of the village, its churchyard flanked by venerable yews. We may pause for lunch in a cosy tearoom or take the chance to visit the local pub, where the low beams and roaring hearth will offer a welcome refuge from the autumn air.\nAfter lunch, we’ll follow quieter lanes and footpaths back to Battle, where history rises from every cobbled street. Here, the Battle of Hastings changed the course of English history: local Anglo-Saxon rulers were replaced with Norman monarchy, feudalism and hierarchy were introduced, nascent women's rights were eliminated, governance and justice were reshaped, French language and culture influenced law, architecture, and language, the political orientation of England was directed towards the European core rather than Scandinavia, and the foundations were laid for a centralized, powerful, data-driven English state.\nOn the day of the walk, this paroxysm will have occurred almost 960 years ago, when on 14 October 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, defeated King Harold II in a brutal clash that lasted most of the day and led to the loss of around 6000 lives. Harold’s army, fighting with spears, swords and axes, advantageously held the high ground behind a shield wall. He momentarily lost control of them when, sensing victory, the Saxon army surged down the hill, abandoning the high ground and the shield wall. The Norman army rallied, and their archers and cavalry - the latter not encountered by Saxon armies before - massacred them. Legend says that Harold fell to an arrow in the eye, a fate depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry. Legend also says that his body was so vengefully mutilated that only his wife, Edith Swan-Neck, could identify it by way of secret marks on his body known only to her.\nThe imposing Battle Abbey, founded by William in 1070 to celebrate the victory (or atone for the bloodshed), and remodelled in the 13th-century stands in partial ruin, its gatehouse still guarding the memory of the battlefield. Cloister arches, monastic remains, and views over the slope where Harold’s army fell will bring the Conquest vividly to mind. It was destroyed in 1538 by a tyrannical beneficiary of that central, powerful English state: Henry VIII.\nAs dusk settles, the last of the autumn light will gild the Abbey’s stone, and participants will head to the pub or disperse, the rustle of fallen leaves echoing the footsteps of history.\nDon't waste that space!\nAutumn walks get busy so please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following: Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control).\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader\nAll pictures were taken by the leader on his recce in August 2025.",

    "Summary": "'Oh no, not again!' you might exclaim at seeing the location and route for this walk, but it is a complete classic. We'll follow the boring footpath along the railway line to the castellated entrance to Clayton Tunnel. We'll look at the twelfth century wall paintings in Clayton Church. We'll reacquaint ourselves with Jack and Jill, the pair of windmills on the South Downs Way. We'll follow that national trail over Ditchling Beacon to Plumpton. We'll see the modest house that the Queen Consort grew up in. We'll take tea and cake in the delightful village of Ditchling. In brief, every last classic and curious feature of the South Downs behind Brighton, plus the views from them over the Weald and over the city itself.\nThe sights:\nClayton:\nA downland village with, as Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\nputs it, 'one striking surprise and two oddities. The oddities are the castellated entrance to the railway tunnel of 1840, and Jack and Jill, a mismatched pair of windmills, he a brick tower mill of 1876, she a wooden post mill of 1821, relocated from Brighton in 1850. [Unfortunately Jack is currently indisposed: he's lost his sails while restoration work goes on. Jill is functioning and open to visitors in the summer]. The surprise is the wall paintings of 1140 in the humble church of St John the Baptist. They are unique in England for their extent, preservation and date.' Buried in the churchyard is Norman Hartnell (1901-1979), fashion designer, best known for his work for the ladies of the royal family including the late queen. Discreetly homosexual and cousin to William Hartnell, first actor to play the Doctor in Doctor Who.\nDitchling Beacon:\nAt 248 metres, it is the highest point in East Sussex. In the care of the\nNational Trust\n, a wide variety of plants can be found there, from chalk downland herbs to certain types of orchid. The hill gives panoramic views to Brighton to the south, the Weald to the north, and the South Downs stretching away to the west and east.\nPlumpton:\nAnimator Gordon Murray's alleged inspiration for Trumpton (Chailey became Chigley and Wivelsfiled Green Camberwick Green) is just a street of cottages with the main suburban residential area at Plumpton Green near the racecourse. St Michael's church is small and Norman with a C13 chancel, but has some faded wall paintings. Plumpton Place is Jacobean, but remodelled by Lutyens in 1927-8. The Laine (former rectory) was the childhood home of Camilla, Queen Consort. At Plumpton Cross Simon de Montfort and his army descended the Downs to engage the army of Henry III at the battle of Lewes in 1264.\nStreat:\nIn a beautiful location with a view to the Downs. The church is over-restored, Norman and C13, but now mostly of 1854. Imposing Streat Place is from 1607-27.\nDitchling:\nBuilt on a crossroads which has the C13 and C14 St Margaret's Church high above it, and very pretty in flint, timber, brick and tile. Interesting buildings include: 'Anne of Cleves' House', which was given by Henry VIII to his fourth queen as part of her marriage annulment settlement; and 'Sopers', the home of wood engraver, stone sculptor, type designer and sexual abuser Eric Gill, which became an artistic community and inspires a museum of the arts and crafts today (designed 2014 by Adam Richards Architects). Noted Ditchling residents include Raymond Briggs and Dame Vera Lynn. Ditchling also has a good supply of pubs and tearooms of which we'll make use.\nKeymer:\nOldlands Windmill is C18, a post mill with an octagonal brick round house.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route details including elevations at the OS website)\n:\nA long, rather tedious footpath next to the railway line will take us to Clayton, where we'll pick up a bridleway past the windmills to connect with the South Downs Way along which we'll head east. At Plumpton Bostall we'll descend the Downs and head north along Plumpton Lane then use footpaths to go near Plumpton Racecourse. We'll then veer west and follow an intermittent bridleway to Streat and Ditchling. At Ditchling we'll head north past Lodge Hill to Oldland. Suburban streets through Keymer and Hassocks will take us back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. There may be some stiles and livestock, plus some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Picture credits: View over the Low Weald:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Morgan\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Ditchling Beacon by Chris Thomas-Atkin:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Jack and Jill Windmills (Clayton Windmills):\nPhoto\n©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Big Bottom:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Capper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Plumpton - Half Moon Public House:\nPhoto\n©\nJames Emmans\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A beautiful autumn afternoon at St Michael, Plumpton (b):\nPhoto\n©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Streat Place:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Clay vale pasture:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); In the centre of Ditchling:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); High Street, Ditchling:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Whitcomb\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Oldland Mill, Keymer:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

RHS Wisley is the flagship garden of the Royal Horticultural Society and has been described as ‘one of the best gardens in the world’. It is a top UK attraction with around 1.3 million visitors every year, and the extensive grounds cover 240 acres showcasing some of the world’s most beautiful plants and flowers.\nAdmission Prices\n£18.10 without Gift Aid if prebooked\nhere\n.\n£19.50 on the gate.\nFree for RHS members and one guest.\n£13.70 - 30% off if you use public transport -\nplease keep tickets and ask for “Car free offer” at welcome desk.\nAll details\nhere\n.\nThe garden is open 10am to 8pm on that Monday (extended from usual 6pm).\nPlease download (or pick up on arrival) the map\nhere\n.\nThe garden has much to offer, and attractions include...\nThe Glasshouse:\nThe cathedral-like Glasshouse features three climatic zones: tropical, moist temperate and dry temperate, and was built to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the RHS.\nThe Rock Garden:\nOne of Wisley’s oldest and most impressive areas featuring winding paths, water features, and a selection of planting schemes.\nBowes-Lyon Rose Garden:\nContains a mixture of 4,000 roses and 5,000 shrubs and herbaceous perennials.\nThe Old Laboratory:\nDiscover the early days of the RHS at Wisley through interactive exhibits including\nthis\n.\nBattleston Hill:\nA showcase for rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias, and hydrangeas with a stunning array of autumn colour.\nOakwood:\nThe most historic part of Wisley, originally created in 1878 within an existing wood.

    "Summary": "We’ll step off the train at Berwick Railway Station into the earthy, woodsmoke-flavoured air of an East Sussex autumn to begin our walk (see the route\nhere\n). A short walk east will lead us to Arlington Reservoir, its still waters reflecting russet trees and scudding clouds. Built in 1971, the reservoir will offer a peaceful start, fringed with golden reeds and alive with birdlife preparing for winter.\nWe’ll follow footpaths into Arlington village, passing the flint-built St Pancras Church, parts of which date back to the 12th century. From there, the path will cross open fields and enter the burnished canopy of Abbots Wood, once part of Michelham Priory’s medieval estate. Among the copper beeches and mossy trunks, we may catch sight of deer slipping through the trees.\nThe walk will then descend into Wilmington, where the Church of St Mary and St Peter, with its Saxon foundations and Norman nave, will stand beside the evocative ruins of a 12th-century Benedictine priory. Before climbing the Downs, we’ll pause at Wilmington’s historic pub—a flint-and-timber inn nestled below the escarpment. With a pint of Sussex ale by the fire or in the garden under golden sycamores, we’ll rest and refuel for the climb.\nFrom there, the Wealdway will lead us up to the Long Man of Wilmington, the enigmatic 92-metre chalk figure carved into the hillside. It is the longest (or tallest) depiction of the human form in Europe but recent research have rather sadly relocated its origins in antiquity to the late 16th- or early 17th century. At the summit, the autumn patchwork of the Weald will unfold beneath us in quiet splendour.\nWe’ll continue over the Cuckmere River and join the Vanguard Way, following it through gentle downland and hedgerow paths into Alfriston. There, timber-framed buildings will lean over winding lanes, St Andrew’s Church will rise with 14th-century grace, and the Alfriston Clergy House—thatched, oak-framed, and acquired by the National Trust in 1896—will evoke a simpler, enduring past. After that, a short walk along the Vanguard Way will return us to Berwick Station for perhaps a pint, but certainly fond farewells.\nDogs\n: Well-behaved dogs are most welcome, but must be kept under control especially where there is livestock.\nTimings:\nWhile leaders make all endeavours to keep the timing accurate, it cannot be guaranteed and we may finish the event later than stated.\nNew members welcome!\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message us, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event may become fully booked, however, if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nadd yourself to the waitlist\n, places often become available closer to the date, and chances are you will still get a place.  And no double booking!\n(Image credits: The Long Man of Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Parker\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Long Man of Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nPAUL FARMER\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Arlington Reservoir:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);\nChurch of St Pancras\n:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Abbots Wood, near Hailsham, East Sussex:\nPhoto\n©\nnick macneill\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Stream Farm, Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nOast House Archive\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Hedge Near Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nPAUL FARMER\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Priory Ruins at Wilmington:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Hooton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Trig point of Wilmington Hill\nPhoto\n©\nTrevor Littlewood\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The George at Alfriston:\nPhoto\n©\nDavid M Clark\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Alfriston houses:\nPhoto\n©\nMichael Dibb\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A busy day in Alfriston:\nPhoto\n©\nTrevor Harris\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Vanguard Way heading to Stonery Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as\nMonkchester\nbefore taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882.  Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear.

    "Date": "Saturday Aug 31 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "2",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "18",
    "Summary": "The Writers’ Way is a 17-mile trail created by Hampshire County Council & East Hampshire District Council to link Alton with villages in the beautiful Hampshire countryside well-known to three famous writers: Jane Austen, Gilbert White, and William Cobbett.\nThis circular walk will follow the Writers’ Way for much of its route, visiting places associated with all three. As 2025 is the 250th anniversary of Austen's birth, I thought would rerun the event.\nThe sights:\nAlton\n: Founded in Anglo-Saxon times, the market town of Alton now has a population of about 18,000. It has many fine Georgian buildings along its long High Street, and is the eastern terminus of the Mid-Hampshire Railway (the Watercress Line).\nWest Worldham:\nLying two miles south-east of Alton, this hamlet of 18 houses contains the grade II listed St Nicholas, a small single-cell church built in the late 12th century.\nSelborne:\nThis is one of the most beautiful villages in Hampshire containing a number of grade I and II listed buildings lying in a dramatic setting beneath Selborne Hanger, a thickly wooded hillside towering some 250 feet above the main street.\nIt is most famous for its association with the Rev. Gilbert White (1720 – 1793), who was born in and lived in the village all his life. After graduating from Oxford University and ordination, White spent a lifetime in Selborne carefully observing and documenting the nature and ecology around him. His research was published in 1789 in ‘The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne’, which is regarded as a pioneering work on English natural history. Such is its importance that the book has never been out of print since its first publication.\nWhite’s home, The Wakes, is now a museum telling the story of this remarkable man. It also houses the Oates Collections relating to the lives of Frank Oates (1840 – 1875), a naturalist & explorer, and his nephew Lawrence Oates (1880 – 1912), a soldier & explorer who perished on Robert Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the South Pole.\nWhite’s work inspired the radical politician William Cobbett (1763 – 1835) to visit Selborne during research he carried out into the living conditions of the rural poor in the 1820’s, and he extensively described the area in his book ‘Rural Rides’.\nThe Zig-Zag Path\n: This was cut in 1753 by Gilbert White and his brother, and ascends 170 feet to the top of Selborne Hanger to give great views to the east of the village. The path consists of more than 20 short sections and is a mix of ramps and steps.\nUpper Farringdon:\nThis small village has associations with both Jane Austen, who used to visit friends in the area, and Gilbert White, who was curate here. A later curate, Thomas Massey, was responsible for the construction of Massey’s Folly, a bizarre brick structure built over 30 years, and whose original purpose is unknown. The churchyard of All Saints contains the Farringdon Yew, reputed to be 3,000 years old and therefore one of the oldest trees in Britain.\nChawton:\nThis village lying just to the south-west of Alton was the home of the novelist Jane Austen (1775 – 1817) for the last eight years of her life until her final illness. Her brother Edward had been adopted by a local family as their heir, and inherited Chawton House and other properties in 1794. In 1809, Edward allowed his mother and sisters to move to Chawton Cottage to provide them with a permanent home, and it was here that all six of Jane’s great novels were either written or revised for publication. The cottage was opened as ‘Jane Austen’s House Museum’ in 1949, and now has 40,000 visitors a year. Chawton House, built in 1580, is also open to visitors.\nPlease note that we will not be actually going round either Gilbert White's House or Jane Austen's House as part of this walk - there will not be enough time.\nThe route\n(see the OS link in the detailed location section):\nFrom Alton station, we will walk along Papermill Lane and Wilsom Road out of the town, under the A31 and head steadily uphill for a couple of miles to West Worldham. Part of this route is along the aptly-named ‘Watery Lane’ – if it is too wet, we can use a path by the side of Worldham Park Golf Club. At West Worldham, we will follow a quiet country road for about a mile before turning south down the Hangers Way to reach Priory Farm (built on the site of 13th century Selborne Priory).  We turn south-west just before the farm to walk beside Coombe Wood and Long Lythe for about a mile before entering Selborne through the churchyard. Here we will break for lunch.\nAfter lunch, we will leave Selborne via the Zig-Zag Path to ascend to the top of the Hanger, cross Selborne Common, and head north-west across field boundaries and a quiet lane to reach Upper Farringdon, to admire Massey’s Folly and the Farringdon Yew. We will then head north along footpaths running parallel to the A32 to reach Chawton, passing first Chawton House, and then Jane Austen’s House Museum. From here it is a further two miles back under the A31 and along the length of Alton High Street to return to the station.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome on this walk, and this is suitable for them, with just one stile to negotiate. However, if we walk through the golf course, dogs must be on a lead as we will be sharing the space with players. There is a small herd of (apparently) tame cattle browsing on Selborne Common, and sheep grazing in a field just before Chawton, and in these areas, dogs must also be on a lead.\nAt other times, a dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPhotos: Jane Austen's House, Chawton (header) / The Zig-Zag Path, Selborne / Alton station / St Nicholas, West Worldham / Victorian post box, West Worldham / St Mary's, Selborne / Plaque on St Mary's / Gilbert White's House, Selborne / Main Street, Selborne / All Saints, Upper Farringdon / The Farringdon Yew / Massey's Folly, Upper Farringdon / St Nicholas, Chawton / Chawton House.\nPhotos taken by the leader 6th August 2025 & permission given to OutdoorLads for use.",

It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form. You can pay at the centre on arrival or online beforehand.

If you've never climbed before, just let us know by messaging the event leader or co-leader, so we can arrange for you to be signed into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try. If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely. Please note that we are limited by the climbing centre as to the number of novice climbers we can supervise, according to the number of experienced people / staff available at the event.\nDo I have to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you can answer YES to all these questions, you can climb without supervision:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the UK. We are always keen to put more on, so if you fancy climbing in your local area contact a climbing leader and we can see what we can arrange.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by Keith\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a few hours of indoor climbing before the AGM.\nWe’ll be at the new, state-of-the-art climbing centre –\nBigDepot Manchester\n! Built to the highest International climbing competition standards, with around 100 lines of roped climbing (including 20 auto-belays), ranging from a dedicated beginner’s area to a comp-class lead overhang wall – offering hundreds of expertly set routes at all levels.  And then there’s the bouldering area; on it's own it would be one of the biggest bouldering venues in the UK - under the same roof! Oh, and don’t forget the café with excellent homemade snacks. Need more kit? - There's a climbers shop too. It’s called\nBig\nDepot for a reason!!  This really is an amazing climbing centre and we can’t wait to welcome you to it!\nWhat is Indoor Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors!\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nOf course, but please sign up to our\nBeginners Session\n, so we can sign you in and supervise you as we show you the ropes.\nWhat about Bouldering?\nAbsolutely!! The Big Depot offers the same high class range of bouldering problems as it does roped climbing. Without the need for ropes bouldering is more accessible for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved, beginners don't need to be supervised, so once we've given you some guidance on how to boulder safely to get you started, you're free to boulder. If you are new to bouldering, as well as signing up here, please message the leader, so we have an idea of numbers needing some guidance. If you're already a boulder - please sign up to this event.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber bur not been to this centre before, you will need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's competency test when you arrive. We'll meet in the café, and after a quick introduction, we'll get you paired up (we'll try and match abilities as best we can!), show you the various climbing areas, and get you climbing.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass this, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there are OutdoorLads leaders available they will be happy to supervise you so you can still climb. If the leaders are already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will still be able to boulder instead (our leaders are only able to sign-in and supervise two climbers during the session).\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for our\nBeginners Session\n;\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nSounds great - where do I sign up?\nRight Here!! Please register via this event page so the event leader can look out for you, but remember, you'll need to pay the centre’s entry fee to the centre on arrival (\nprices are here\n).\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list. Places might open up as the event gets nearer and, we'll try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers if we can.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nYou will need to make sure you complete the centres\nRegistration and Disclaimer\n- this also counts for climbers who have already been to other DEPOT centres - you need to complete a new registration for BIG Depot Manchester if you've not been to this centre before, as it has different restrictions. If you are bouldering please complete the normal 18+ Unsupervised form and just answer no to all of the rope climbing questions - unless of course you have these skills.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

As no ropes are involved, you don't need to be supervised and it's much easier to get into.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nOf course, read through the information below, and sign up to this event and we'll show you the ropes, and get you started on your climbing journey. If bouldering sound more like your thing then please sign up to the other\nAGM Climbing event\n; even if you're new to it - as you won't need to be supervised, we'll get you started, give you some guidance on how to boulder safely and with the others there. event as you won't need to be supervised, but we'll still .\nI'm a proficient climber - and don't think I need to be supervised?\nIf you are already an experienced climber then please sign up to our\nExperienced Climbers event\n. You'll be asked to take the centre's competency test when you arrive, and if successful then you will be able to climb unsupervised. As a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for our this beginners session;\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nSounds great - where do I sign up?\nRight Here!! Please register via this event page so we can keep a check on numbers as our leaders are only able to sign-in and supervise two climbers each during the session. Please remember, you'll need to pay the centre’s entry fee to the centre on arrival (\nprices are here\n).\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list. Places might open up as the event gets nearer and, we'll try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers if we can.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nYou will need to make sure you complete the centres\nRegistration and Disclaimer\n- this also counts for climbers who have already been to other DEPOT centres - you need to complete a new registration for BIG Depot Manchester if you've not been to this centre before, as it has different restrictions. If you are bouldering please complete the normal 18+ Unsupervised form and just answer no to all of the rope climbing questions - unless of course you have these skills.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It's of the national parks most popular sites, gives great views of the area. It's name means Mother Hill, due to the multiple smaller hills emanating from it's summit; though it's also know as the Shivering Mountain, due to its shale base causing occasional land slips. The summit and surroundings are also archaeologically interesting, being home to several bronze and iron age hill forts.\nLord's Seat:\nThe highest point of the Rushup Edge ridge, this hill will give us more fantastic views of the Peaks. As this will be a quieter part of the walk, we may get to see some of the wildlife that live in the hills too.\nThe Pennine Way:\nEngland's first national trail spans from Derbyshire to the Scottish Border. We'll join the trail after leaving the station, giving us great views down The Vale of Edale.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This walk is a most attractive one, predominantly across fields and through woods,  however don't be deceived by the lovely surroundings as our midway destination of Annesley Hall has quite the chilling aura about it.\nNestled in Nottinghamshire, just next to derelict and spooky Annesley Old Church surrounded by grisly looking gnarled gravestones, the atmosphere can make one quite skittish.  This historic mansion has seen centuries of change, from its medieval beginnings to its Georgian grandeur.\nThe gentle walk back crosses over an old mott and bailey castle earthwork.\nHistorical Insights:\nAnnesley Hall dates back to the 13th century and has been home to several notable families, including the Chaworths and the Byrons. The hall is famously connected to Lord Byron, the notorious poet, who had a doomed love affair with Mary Chaworth, the heiress to Annesley Hall. This unrequited love inspired some of his early works and added to the hall's romantic yet eerie legacy.\nA Spooky Tale:\nLegend has it that the ghost of Mary Chaworth herself haunts the grounds of Annesley Hall. People have reported seeing a forlorn woman in white wandering the gardens at night, believed to be Mary, still mourning her lost love. Some say you can hear whispering in the hallways or see flickering lights in the abandoned rooms. The most spine-tingling tale involves an old oak tree where it's said Mary and Lord Byron would secretly meet. At midnight, those brave enough to stand by the tree might hear whispers of their tragic love story carried on the wind.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "8.3 miles/ 13.35kms circular walk\nThe rolling hills of south Northamptonshire are a relatively unknown gem for walkers in the south Midlands. This very rural, unspoilt area is bounded by Banbury in the west, Brackley to the south, Towcester to the east and Daventry to the north. It has a bit of a Cotswold feel - but without the tourists!\nThis is hunting country - the Grafton Hunt has been chasing foxes across the landscape since the mid 18th century and their more positive legacy is a network of bridleways and green lanes that enable easy access to the countryside.\nOur walk starts in front of the charming 17th century Red Lion pub in Culworth, before we swoop down into a gentle valley and climb up the other side into Eydon which is packed full of soft brown ironstone cottages which are typical of the area. We'll pass by the stocks on Eydon's village green, if any of you want to hurl a few cabbages!\nThere is a short section of road walking without a pavement as we leave Eydon before we head back onto paths. The rest of our walk includes a lovely variety of fine views, a number of fishing lakes and a couple of short stretches of woodland. We'll stop for a picnic lunch just after the half way mark.\nThe final section takes us back towards Culworth with a distant view of the HS2 viaduct construction close to Edgcote House, the stately home that provided the setting for Mr Bingley's \"rented accommodation\" in the BBC's 1997 version of Pride and Prejudice.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nPhotos:\nAll photos taken by walk leader and other ODL members used with permission.",

    "Summary": "Distance: 11.5 miles/18.5km\nThe market town of Rugeley lies on the north-eastern edge of Cannock Chase next to the River Trent. The development of the town during the industrial revolution was greatly influenced by construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal with Rugeley lying between Haywood Junction with the Staffs and Worcester Canal to the north and Fradley Junction with the Coventry Canal to the south. In more recent times, it became synonymous with coal mining at Lea Hall Colliery and the coal-fired power stations, all of which have now been swept away to redevelopment.\nWe will begin our journey at The Old Chancel, the remains of the predecessor to St. Augustine’s Church opposite, a peaceful place with a surprisingly sinister neighbour. After a short walk, we will descend the “bloody steps” to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Brindley Bank, for another foray into Rugeley’s darker past, before crossing Brindley’s aqueduct over the River Trent and following the towpath into the countryside.\nOur walk now follows bridle paths back towards the border of the town and Cannock Chase, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Etchinghill, a small village which has now all but merged with Rugeley is well known to the locals for its ice-age sandstone tip which offers views over the edge of the Chase (as well as a place where generations have carved their initials into the rock).\nFrom there, we will venture into Cannock Chase, stopping at the Birches Valley Forest Centre before continuing to Fair Oak Pools and then following Rising Brook back towards Rugeley and wander through Elmore Park.\nSamuel will be ably assisted on the event by Patrick who's being assessed to become a walk leader too!\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nPhotos:\nAll photos taken by walk leader.",

Many of the buildings had river connections, acting as warehouses and although today only one public house remains, there were once 16 inns to satisfy the demands of locals, watermen and shipbuilders.\nFrom here we walk through forest on the Welsh side of the Wye passing through Botany Bay and Barbadoes Green before our arrival at Tintern for lunch.  The plan is to stop at the Abbey Mill for an hour giving plenty of time to explore the galleries and shop. or if you chose make a visit to the Abbey ruins (an entrance fee applies)\nWe then cross back over the wye using the recently restored railway bridge and follow the Wye Valley Greenway before turning off at Green Thorns for the hardest climb of the day back up to the Offa's Dyke path to take in the views at the Devils Pulpit and return to our cars.\nDogs will be welcome on the walk but there are a couple of stiles that larger dogs may find difficult.

    "Summary": "Join us on this 11 mile circular walk taking in the delights of Cadbury Castle (Iron Age Hill Fort) and the surrounding villages with some outstanding views over the countryside reaching far beyond as we endeavour to explore more of Somerset and Dorset verging on their neighbouring borders.\nWe will start our walk in the village of South Cadbury a stones throw from the A303 near Sparkford on the junction for the A359. From the village we will ascend to this Iron Age Hill Fort from where we can take in some outstanding panoramic views, which on a clear day from this vantage point are mightily impressive.\nThe back story regarding this site of Arthur's court of Camelot (and, indeed, the very existence of the semi-mythical king himself) is among the greatest and most romantic mysteries of a Dark Age Britain however Cadbury Castle has a better claim than most. Excavations in the 1960s show the hill was extensively refortified around AD500 about the time when a great British chieftain possibly King Arthur was leading the resistance to the Saxon advance in the Southwest. Whether or not this was the case Camelot the site is an impressive one and the views are not only superb though also extensive.\nAfter taking in the Hill Fort we will return back to the village of South Cadbury, and we will embark walking along footpaths across the rolling dry-valley landscape to Charlton Horethorne.\nAfter a lunch break we then venture south-westwards via Seven Wells (the source of the River Yeo) toward Corton Denham, Corton Hill and Parrack Hill, where again we will take in some extensive views across the lush meadows, fertile farmlands, and beyond to the Somerset Levels.\nEventually we will loop around in our walk to pass through the village of Sutton Montis, whose church has a fine 13th century tower and normal chancel arch, returning homeward to our original point of departure of South Cadbury.\nPlease note we shall be walking on a busy road (for a very short distance), quiet lanes, bridle paths, meadows, orchards, and crossing farmland with both arable and livestock (cattle, horses, and sheep). The terrain could be uneven in parts so walking boots should be considered a key and essential part of your kit.\nIt will also be slightly muddy in parts if we have experienced any rain.\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring and Summer walks mean lots of new and existing members excited to be getting out more. Please only book if you know you can make it. Should your plans change please free up the space immediately for someone else who could attend.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nRemember we will encounter livestock and horses, and land owners and authorities have clearly signposted  their expectation of the integrity and assurity they require  of any dog owner, and their dog whilst on their farm land.\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, then feel free to message me or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nImage / photo credits:\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A day starting in Barnham and heading south to Bognor Regis for lunch on the beach. On the way we’ll see rolling farmland, streams, examples of past and modern architecture before taking in the sights of a seaside resort. Our return journey will see more features such has pleasant parks, the remains of a canal and a historic church.\nThis plan and walk will form the lovely\nStewart Allen\n's assessment event as he endeavours to become a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader for OutdoorLads. Your support for Stewart is sought.\nThe Sights:\nBarnham:\nA village were old meets new. There are plenty of older buildings some going back centuries and new houses, which in fairness do blend in. The village was originally listed in the Domesday book with just 24 households. The area is dotted with massive greenhouses growing an array of vegetables and salad items. If you shop at the major supermarkets then the chances are an item has come from here. The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a lovely hidden gem dating back to 1086. We will be able to look around the grounds and view the inside.\nBognor Regis:\nFamous seaside resort. You will probably have heard of Butlins there. It is also famous for the ‘Bird Man’ competition that used to take place on the pier. The town took on the ‘Regis’ part after the town petitioned King George. This was following his stay in the town following illness.\nBarnham Canal:\nWho’d have thought these rolling fields would hold the remains of a canal. Sadly, it never made any money and the birth of the railway soon put the final nail in the coffin.\nSwimming:\nThis walk\ndoes not\ninclude swimming as the group's insurance policy does not cover it. You may wish to swim but you do so at your own risk.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe leave Barnham Station and walk along Yapton Road before turning on to farmland and pleasant fields. Every so often we get to enjoy farm buildings or an array of clearly expensive houses. This landscape accompanies us to the outskirts of Bognor Regis. Here we see a variety of seaside properties from various time periods. Once reaching the seafront we enjoy a nice stroll along the seafront. The famous Butlins Park is clearly visible on the skyline for much of this section, together with the Pier. The pier of course offering memories of the Bird Man competitions of the past. After lunch we head back inland passing a pleasant arcade of shops and travelling through Hotham Park. This park is dedicated to and was established by Sir Richard Hotham the founder of Bognor Regis. Further inland still we meet a busy part of town with an array of big out of town shops. It is then a trip over the railway crossing and a walk by an airfield before crossing a golf course. More flat and pleasant footpaths await us as we continue before reaching an historic part of Barnham. We get to visit the local church which dates from 1086 and see the remains of a canal. Finally, a gentle stroll takes us back to Barnham station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can take part.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me (Gavin) if you have any questions.\n(All photos taken by the aspiring leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

Held at the world famous Trent Bridge Cricket Ground, with both indoor and outdoor spaces, this is a great day our for fans of\nreal ale and real cider.\nIf you are a lager, wine or gin fanatic, I wouldn't bother, there will be very little there to appeal to you!\nYou get a half pint glass on entry, which is yours to keep if you wish, and then can buy beer from a multitude of stalls in half pint or third-pint measures, so you can sample several different beers. There are food stalls and merchandise to buy, lots of the local breweries have a bigger presence there with their own stands, and it's a jolly fun day out! We'll find an area there that we will loosely use to meet up, as we will be going off to buy beer, and so we wont be staying as a whole group for the whole day - but that's good for getting to chat to new people! Note that the event is cashless.\nTo come on this event, you will need to sign up to this event page, but then you will also need to buy a ticket to gain  entry to the festival itself. You can buy a ticket for\nThursday 9th October here\n- it is £12 until the 8th August, after which it is £15 in advance, or £18 if you pay on the day. Up to you, but note that you are responsible for your own ticket and OutdoorLads wont be able to reimburse you if you later can't attend.\nWe'll aim to meet at midday on or near Trent Bridge and go in together, but don't worry if you cant be there that early - we can meet you inside. We'll have a Telegram group on the day to help stay in touch.\nSo come and have a fun, sociable day trying different beers with OutdoorLads!\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nAll taken by L Russell and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Little ringed plovers, avocets and oystercatchers sometimes breed, while in winter the lagoons are home to pintails, wigeons, goldeneyes, snipe and shovelers. Rarer visitors include bitterns.\nThere will be ample opportunity on this walk to stop and view birdlife from the various hides on the site. The walk will not be wholly on the reserve but include field paths and tracks in the countryside surrounding the reserve, where you can enjoy the redkites as they glide majestically across the skies.\nA good time for collecting blackberries and slows as we stroll along tracks and paths.\nThe reserve has apple trees scattered around its grounds and is happy for visitors to take some, as long as there's some left for the wildlife, so bring your carrier bag should you wish to have some free apples to make apple pie over the weekend (*Note: Baking is optional)\nAfter the walk there's the option to enjoy tea and cake at the nearby Yolk Farm cafe before your journey home.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this event.

    "Summary": "'Lads who travelled from London to the south coast for my summer walks might be glad to see that this autumnal walk is much closer to home. Just outside the M25 the land rears up to form the Greensand Ridge. This then folds into a series of hills and heaths (called 'charts') that afford wonderful views of the Weald. The Surrey Hills National Landscape (formerly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) adjoins the Kent Downs National Landscape and we'll move from one to the other and back again, savouring stone-built houses and churches where performers and premiers lived and died. Chief among these is Churchill's Chartwell, the view from which he called 'the most beautiful and charming'.\nThe sights:\nLimpsfield, Crockhamhill and Hosey Commons:\nWooded common land on the Greensand Ridge and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Crockhamhill Common has a series of old ragstone mines that provide a hibernation site for five species of bats. Hazel, oak and sweet chestnut colonise the better soils, but Scots pine and birch the poorer ones.\nChartwell:\nFrom 1922 until his death in 1965 the home of Winston Churchill, much used by him when out of political office for rallying the anti-appeasement cause, composing speeches, writing books, building walls, constructing lakes and painting. An early Victorian house of medieval origins, but rebuilt and extended in an arts and crafts style by Philip Tilden in the late 1910s. The house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \"the most beautiful and charming\" Churchill had ever seen. Grade I listed.\nToys Hill:\nOutstanding views of the Weald are to be had from a terrace donated in 1898 by Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the National Trust, who lived at nearby Crockham Hill. One of the National Trust's first properties. Over the years it was added to, so the National Trust's Toys Hill estate now runs to more than 200 acres (81 ha) of woodland. The area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its abundant wildlife, and a Grade I site of national importance for nature conservation. We'll have lunch at the top which is 235m up and on a terrace which is the remains of the vast Weardale House of 1910, neglected, bombed in the war and pulled down in the 1940s. French Street is a pretty hamlet.\nWesterham:\nNear Sevenoaks and on the River Darent. Granted a market charter in 1277. St Mary's Church is C13 and is unusual in displaying the country's only royal arms of Edward VI. General James Wolfe was born in the town in 1727 and is commemorated by a statue on the Green. Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice lived in the Vicarage for a brief period. John Lennon stopped at a Westerham antiques shop and purchased a poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal, which inspired the song, \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" The statue of Churchill on the village green was the gift of General Tito of Yugoslavia. William Pitt the Younger regularly stayed in the town. We'll have a tea/pub break in the town on the way back.\nLimpsfield:\nThe parish has over 20 medieval buildings and around 90 listed ones. Overbuilt St Peter's Church is C12. The composer Frederick Delius is buried in the churchyard, as is his wife Jelka. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham is buried only a few yards from Delius, whose music he supported. Nearby are the graves of cellist Beatrice Harrison and ashes of clarinettist Jack Brymer, both of whom worked with Beecham.\nOxted:\nMostly a suburbanised commuter town, built in excessive, but quite pleasing mock-Tudor stucco and timber framing. The town occupies a gap in the greensand ridge. The Greenwich Meridian runs through the town and Keir Starmer grew up in it.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route, its distance and elevations, at the OS website):\nHaving walked along Station Road and Snatts Hill from the station in Oxted, we'll cross the A25 then follow Rockfield Road to meet the Greensand Way (GSW). This will take us east, all the way to Limpsfield Common, Limpsfield Chart, Crockhamhill Common and Mariners Hill. At Chartwell, we'll take Puddledock Lane eastwards. We'll then ascend and descend Toys Hill but have lunch at the top. Following French Street northwest across Hosey Common and cross the B2026, we'll take footpaths to Westerham for a tea break. We'll then head west along the A25 (there's a pavement) and take a footpath to the southwest to reach The High Chart. A bridleway along the River Darent will take us to Limpsfield Common to cross the Common. Then, walking along Limpsfield High Street we'll get to Granville Road and head west along it to Gresham Road which will bring us back to the station in Oxted.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There will be plenty of shade and woods and commons for them to run free but also some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All images were taken by the leader on his recce.

Since the 1980s the hall has been unoccupied but the city and English Heritage are looking to find a suitable redevelopment. As of July 2022, it remained on the Heritage at Risk register.\nSt Alkmund's Church\nin Duffield is adjacent to an ancient crossing of the River Derwent, south of the main village. This religious site, during Anglo-Saxon times, was probably a refuge for travellers. The earliest remains of the existing building are from the Norman period. Duffield Bridge was constructed in 13th century and later widened for the Chesterfield Turnpike in 1812.\nNearby\nDuffield\nwas originally a Celtic settlement from about 400BCE. The Romans arrived in the area in 43CE. The Doomsday Survey records \"Duvelle\" in Norman times when Duffield Castle (demolished) was built to protect the hunting grounds of Duffield Frith.\nLooking downstream, dominating the skyline on the eastern bank, is the brick chimney of Peckwash Mill. Originally a corn mill in 13th century but later, a paper mill of massive importance, being the largest producer of paper in the world during its heyday. A terrace of 14 cottages, known as Blue Mountain cottages, were built for the paper mill in about 1850.\nWe head eastwards up Eaton Bank and on to the Midshires Way towards Little Eaton, where we pause at the Queen's Head pub for lunch.

    "Summary": "I don't think that Ashdown Forest, a medieval hunting forest of heathland like the New Forest, but more elevated, has been explored from Buxted before by us 'Lads. On what I hope will be a classic autumn walk, we'll wander among the bracken and birch as their fronds and foliage turn. We'll take in deep draughts of cool air as we survey the panoramic outlines of the High Weald National Landscape. We'll track down one of Ashdown's little waterfalls, and hope that the weather's been wet enough to make it more than a dribble. We'll admire Nutley Windmill’s weathered sails, still standing strong against the sky. We'll down tea and cake at a tearooms with friends old and new.\nThe sights:\nBuxted:\nA historic East Sussex village with Saxon origins, Buxted developed as a Wealden ironworking settlement. Its charming High Street and rolling countryside lend a tranquil rural aesthetic. Buxted Park Hotel was originally an C18 Palladian mansion designed by Sir Thomas Robinson, this Grade II* listed country house is now a luxury hotel, set amid 312 acres of deer park and formal gardens. St Margaret's Church is a flint and stone Norman church dating from the C13, known for its medieval architecture and peaceful setting. Restored in the C19.\nMaresfield:\nA picturesque village mentioned in the Domesday Book, with traditional tile-hung cottages and a C13 church, St Bartholomew. It has a pleasant woodland setting and village green. The Chequers Inn is Georgian. Duddleswell is a scattered hamlet on the edge of Ashdown Forest, known for its tea rooms and forge. Another hamlet, Fairwarp, possesses a striking church: to a simple box of 1881 was added an apse and a tower in an almost expressionistic style in 1930 due to the generosity of the Eckstein family whose monuments are in the churchyard.\nAshdown Forest:\nOnce a medieval royal hunting ground, this 6,500-acre heathland which is part of the High Weald National Landscape, was the inspiration for A.A. Milne's\nWinnie-the-Pooh\n. The landscape offers sweeping vistas and ecological significance. Camp Hill, where we'll have lunch, is an elevated ridge offering panoramic views across the forest.\nThe Airman’s Grave:\nA poignant WWII memorial to a crashed Halifax bomber crew (1941), set in a glade.\nNutley Windmill:\nA rare open-trestle post mill, likely built in the early 19th century. Restored and maintained by volunteers, it’s the only surviving windmill of its type in Sussex and one of only five in the country.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields, woods and heaths for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n:\nHeading west along the A272, we'll pick up a footpath across Buxted Park and then use its driveway to get to Cooper's Green. Millwood Lane and Underhill will take us to Maresfield, then Nursery Lane north to Fairwarp where we'll pick up the Sussex Diamon Way heaidng west. At the Airman's Grave, we'll head north across the heath to Marlpits and Nutley Windmill. At Friends' Clump we'll head east to Camp Hill for lunch. The B2026 will take us to Duddleswell for tea and cake. A footpath and the Wealdway heading south and east will take us back to Buxted.\n(Image credits: Ashdown Forest and the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View across Ashdown Forest from the Wealdway:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of St Margaret:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Buxted Park:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Readings Mead:\nPhoto\n©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Maresfield village centre:\nPhoto\n©\nnick macneill\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nursery Lane, Fairwarp, Sussex:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Trimming\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Christ Church, Fairwarp - Churchyard:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); House to the west of Duddleswell Tea Rooms:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Hawfinch\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Friends' Clump, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Nutley Windmill, Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Late afternoon sun on Ashdown Forest:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); All images are copyrighted but are here credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA/2.0\n.)",

    "Summary": "'Here lie I and my three Daughters, All by drinking Cheltenham Waters. If we'd kept to Epsom Salts, We wouldn't be lying here in these Vaults'.\n(Anonymous epitaph, 1701)\nYou too will feel the benefit of coming to Epsom and taking the air, if not the Magnesium sulphate-rich water, on this highly accomplishable, highly London-accessible walk. Being within a desirable suburban area, don't expect vast expanses of open countryside and not seeing a soul. Do expect great views over the racecourse and towards London, a wealth of Late Stuart, Queen Anne and Georgian Houses, and some pleasant commonland corners tucked between them. We'll trace the history of the twin causes of the town's continuing prosperity - Epsom Salts and Epsom Races - but above all, as always, the magic will be manifested in the company we keep and the sense of achievement we attain.\nThe sights:\nEpsom:\nA historic market town, known for its role in the discovery of Epsom salts (Magnesium sulphate) in 1618. The town flourished as a spa destination in Late Stuart and early Georgian era, with Samuel Pepys visiting it in 1667 and noting 'much Company'. Other spas had overtaken it by 1710, and it had declined, but it was rediscovered by wealthy Londoners seeking more salubrious summer air in the 1720s. Notable buildings include the Clock Tower (built in 1847), St Martin of Tours Church, and several Queen Anne and Georgian townhouses. Rosebery Park is a beautifully landscaped Victorian park complete with ornamental gardens, a duck pond, and a bandstand.\nEpsom Racecourse and Grandstand:\nFounded in 1779 for the Epsom Oaks races and expanded with the Derby Stakes in 1780, Epsom Racecourse is one of the world's finest flat racing venues. As is usual, the chalk geology provides well-drained, short, springy turf. The current grandstand, opened in 2009, was designed by architects Populous in a flashy airport style (the elegance of Goodwood is absent). The racecourse was the site of suffragette Emily Davison’s fatal protest in 1913, when she tried to attach a suffragette banner to the King's (George V's) horse Anmer on Derby Day, and was knocked down and trampled. There is a statue to her in Epsom marketplace. This event occurred at Tattenham Corner, a sharply curving section infamous in racing lore, where fortunes often change mid-race.\nWalton Downs:\nLocated on the southern perimeter of the racecourse, Walton Downs forms part of the wider chalk downland landscape. The area was historically used for military training and is now a popular spot for walkers and gallops for training racehorses.\nAshtead Park:\nA historic estate dating to the C17, centered around a manor house redesigned in the C18 by a wonderfully-named architect called Stiff Leadbetter. Once the seat of prominent landowners, it is now home to City of London Freemen’s School. The landscaped grounds are dotted with ornamental lakes and ancient trees, which we'll see, reflecting the ideals of English landscape gardening.\nEpsom Common and Stew Pond:\nA designated Local Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has ancient woodland, heathland, and historic ponds. The Stew Pond—once used to store live fish for feasting by medieval monks—is now a haven for wildlife and walkers.\nThe Well (Epsom Well):\nLocated amid houses on Epsom Common, the Epsom Well was discovered by a farmer in 1618 when he noticed his cows would avoid the bitter water, the bitterness coming from Magnesium sulphate. The waters became famous in the mid-C17 when the waters were found to have purgative, healing and muscle relaxant properties. This led to the creation of the first commercially available mineral salt: Epsom salts. The well’s fame drew visitors from across England, turning Epsom into a fashionable spa town before Bath and Tunbridge Wells gained prominence.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll head northeast up the High Street then turn southeast down Church Street. We'll leave Burgh Hetah Road and take a bridleway to the racecourse. Walking over Grandstand Road we'll cross Epsom Racecourse at Tattenham Corner and proceed across the roughs and gallops on to Walton Downs. A bridleway heading west to Langley Vale will take us to Ashtead Park which we'll walk through before we pick up the Thames Downs Link to Epsom Common. Rounding Stew Pond we'll see The Well and then cross Dorking Road. We'll walk back along Woodcourt Green Road and take a footpath to Rosebery Park. A walk through the town centre and along the A24 will return us to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of times when they have to go on leads, but also lots of times when they don't. There might be sheep and horses but no stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Image credits: Gallops:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Capper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); London View from Grandstand Road, Epsom:\nPhoto © Kotomi\n(\ncc-by-nc/2.0\n).

    "Title": "A Waterside Walk from Woking to Wisley by Way of the Wey",
    "Date": "Saturday Sep 13 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "6",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "44",
    "Summary": "The Wey was one of the first rivers in England to be made navigable and the River Wey Navigation opened in 1653. On this circular route (which includes three kilometres walking through Woking's most salubrious suburbs), we'll walk about five kilometres along the navigation, passing five sets of lock gates as we do so. We'll also follow a stretch of the River Wey to Wisley Common for a change of scenery and a spot of lunch. We'll just skirt the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens before heading back, where the village of Pyrford, remarkably unaffected by the presence of Woking, might be of interest, likewise the ruins of Newark Priory and the house of the poet John Donne.\nThe sights:\nOld Woking:\nThe original centre of Woking and a market town in the C17. Now a forlorn place with some of the old houses demolished to make way for the A247. The Manor House is fine mid-C17, The Grange C18. St Peter's Church was originally Norman, but is now mostly C13. There is some character in the lane leading to it. Hoe Place is a former mansion which is home to the Hoe Bridge School Preparatory department. Early Victorian in appearance, it dates from 1680 and was a favourite retreat of Lady Castlemaine, a mistress of King Charles II. The school chapel dates from 1850.\nRiver Wey Navigation:\nThe River Wey and Godalming Navigations provide a 20-mile (32km) navigable route from the River Thames near Weybridge to Godalming. Both waterways are owned by the National Trust but managed by the Wey Navigation Trust. The five locks we'll see (Papercourt Lock has a stepped side channel and Walsham Gate has a weir where the River Wey itself joins) were refurbished in 2021 as part of a £9m programme across seven sites. At Walsham Lock there is also a fish pass to aid fish in spawning.\nNewark Priory:\nThe Priory was granted substantial lands in the late C12 during the reign of Richard I. Originally called Aldbury but changed to 'Newark' from the Latin for 'New Place' (\nnovo loco\n). Dissolved in 1538 and given to the Master of the King's Horse. A cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard the buildings to provide building stone. Lord Onslow, the owner in the 1730s, decided to preserve what remained. A scheduled ancient monument and Grade I-listed. Located on private land so cannot be reached at closer proximity than the Wey path.\nPyrford Place:\nGrade II-listed, considered C17. The big square summerhouse overlooking the Wey bears a plaque claiming that John Donne, the metaphysical poet, soldier and Dean of St Paul's lived there from 1600 to 1604, but it is more likely he lived in a main house nearby. The Wey Navigation was completed in 1653 (here not the natural river), so it seems likely the building post-dates this.\nOckham Mill:\nA five-storey polychrome brick water mill, dated 1862, Grade II-listed.\nWisley:\nThe C12 church, farm buildings and a handful of cottages have been spoilt by the presence of the M25 and a sewage works, so we'll omit them. Wisley Common is heathland, a valuable habitat. We'll edge around RHS Wisley and see some of it from the public footpath. We'll have our lunch on the Common by the mere at about 13.30.\nPyrford:\nSt Nicholas' Church is humble, unaltered and in the centre of a loose grouping of brick cottages. It is intact Norman and Grade I listed. Fine wall paintings. Pyrford Court is Neo-Georgian, 1910. We'll have a drink at The Anchor pub at Pyrford Lock at about 14.30. Pyrford is mentioned in\nThe War of the Worlds\nby HG Wells in which it is near the landing site of the third of ten Martian cylinders and is thus obliterated. Wells would give readings of this passage at dinner parties to his friends from the village, gleefully recounting the destruction of their houses.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website):\nWe'll follow White Rose Lane south and east away from the station and then Hoe Stream through its nature reserve. At Hoe Bridge we'll take the B382 and go south then west to Old Woking. After a short distance along the A247's pavement, we'll head southeast across Broad Mead. Much of the outward-bound route will now be on the Fox Way and along the River Wey Navigation towpath which we'll leave at Ockham to take a footpath to Wisley. After lunch at Wisley Common, we'll walk northwest along Wisley Lane before turning southwest at the church to use footpaths to go to Pyrford Lock and the pub stop. We'll then walk south along the Wey Naviogation but turn west at Manor Farm to use footpaths to go to Pyrford village. We'll then use Church Lane northwards to Pyrford Court where we'll pick up a footpath through the woods called the Rough. We'll emerge into suburbia at Maybury and use Park Road to get back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is ideal for them, although there may be some fields with livestock and will be some B-roads to cross. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All pictures were taken by the leader in October 2022. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "The Climbing Academy is one of the best bouldering centres in the South West. With over 200 problems in a 750 square metre area there is enough to keep even the avid of boulderers occupied.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' as they are referred to tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. For this reason, it is often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nTo come along, you will need to register via the event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive. For entry fee prices go to:\nhttps://www.theclimbingacademy.com/prices/\n. As we start at 8pm you will pay the off-peak price.\nFor your first time climbing with us, especially if you are a novice climber, please contact the event leader in advance to let him know what your skills and experience are.\nIt is important that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nClimbing and Bouldering Participation statement\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement, here\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Brownsea Island, owned by the National Trust, is a gorgeous island and nature reserve sitting in the picturesque Poole Harbour. It is famous for its nature and history, as the home of red squirrels as well as the birthplace of the Scouting movement.\nThis is a leisurely day out in which we'll get the boat from Poole Quay, spend some time wandering around the island before getting the boat back. Please note there is a cost for the boat crossing as well as island entry - as detailed below.\nWe will meet at the meeting point as detailed below before getting our ferry tickets from the orange kiosk, for which we'll aim for the 11:00 crossing.\nAn adult ferry ticket is £14.50 return\n. During the crossings you will get to see the delights of Poole Harbour - the second largest natural harbour in the world - including Sandbanks (home of the rich and famous), the other harbour islands, and glimpses of the Isles of Purbeck on the other side.\nEntry to the island is\n£11 per adult\n(or free for National Trust members). Once there, I have no fixed agenda - we will stay as a group and probably conduct a circular walk of the island which is about 4 miles, with flexibility for us to stay longer at different places should the group wish. Please bring a packed lunch which we will eat at one of the many beaches. We will see some of the main sites including Brownsea Castle (closed to the public) and the Baden-Powell Scouting statue. Hopefully we will glimpse some red squirrels too!\nAs the group wishes, I intend for us to get the 15:00 or 16:00 crossing back to Poole. Once back there, I will propose visiting one or two of the lovely pubs along Poole Quay or in the nearby Poole Old Town.\nPlease note that\ndogs are not permitted\nto enter Brownsea Island by the National Trust.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads on the Classic Lakes District route across Helvellyn’s edges; Striding and Swirral Edges, both Grade 1 scrambles.\nStarting from Glenridding we’ll first ascend Birkhouse Moor before following the broad-grassy ridge up to the “Hole in the wall” at the foot of Bleaberry Crag and on to Striding edge to the summit of Helvellyn; England’s 3rd highest mountain. Descent will be down Swirral edge leading up to the summit of Catstye Cam, before heading back down in to the valley and back to Glenridding.\nBoth Striding Edge & Swirral Edge are classed as Grade 1 scrambles, meaning you’ll have hands on rock for some of the sections, and will need a good head for heights. Whilst there is a slightly less exposed ‘alternate path’ below Striding edge, the final ascent up to the summit of Helvellyn will require ‘hands on rock’ and there is no avoiding the first section descending the arete to Swirral edge.\nThis\nis the intended route, however, to the nature of the proposed route we may have to alter this to suit the weather conditions on the day.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list. Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nIs it dog friendly?\nUnfortunately, this isn't suitable for dogs due to the terrain.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nMake a weekend of it:\nHow about a\nFriday Fells\ntoo?\nImage\n/\nphoto\ncredits\n:  All images (c) Sieh with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Rearranged from 29th July to 27th September.\nJoin Outdoor Lads for a big day out, hill walking at the edge of The Peak District. Great for those wanting to get public transport from Manchester.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nDovestone Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve is ran by the RSPB and is home to many rare moorland species, most notably the peregrine falcon and mountain hares, which we'll see if we're lucky.\nAlphin Pike:\nThe first of our hills will be well earned after and long steep ascent from Greenfield. We'll be rewarded with fantastic views over to Manchester and back down to the lakes below.\nAshway Moss:\nOur second hill lies deeper into the moorland and gives a more remote feel. The heather will also start to bloom at this time, so the hills may have their purple blanket. Due to it's remoteness, this will be our best chance of seeing some of the animals that live here.\nThe Trinnacle:\nThis fascinating rock formation is looks over the valley below and will be a great picture spot. We won't be climbing onto the formation itself, as that would be beyond the scope of this walk.\nGreenfield Brook:\nAs we return back from the moorland, we descend down the beautiful Greenfield Brook. This will be one of the more challenging parts of the walk, as we'll need to take care coming down the rocky path.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Difficulty & Distance": "This hike is about 21km (13 miles) with roughly 500m (1700 ft) of ascent. There is a steep ascent early in the walk and a scrambly descent over rocky ground towards the end. Much of the walk is up in the moorland on faint trails.",

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

The start time is to allow for members to travel by train from Glasgow or Edinburgh. The start location is a 20 minute walk along the River Ness from the centre. Why not make a weekend of it and join Mark on the Sunday at Aldourie Castle Garden (\nAldourie Castle Garden - Scottish Open Gardens | OutdoorLads\n) and the Inverness Social at the Eden Court Cinema / Theatre bar (\nInverness Social | OutdoorLads\n). If you need accommodation, Inverness has lots. The Bught Caravan and Camping site is very close to the start of this walk (invernesscaravanpark.com). Or there are lots of hotel, B&B and hostel options too.\nThis is a flat walk! We will be sandwiched between the River Ness and Caledonian Canal, with views of the hills and woodland close to the northern end of Loch Ness.\nThis is a popular route for walkers, cyclists, joggers and more, and we will almost certainly see plenty of boats on the canal. Built by Thomas Telford, this route provided a crucial short-cut from the North Sea to the Irish Sea for shipping, avoiding treacherous waters around the north and west coasts of Scotland. Nowadays, it is a mecca for pleasure boats and canoeists.\nThere is a good cafe and ice cream parlour at Dochgarroch, as well as basic facilities (loos, coffee bar, if open) at the start.\nThere is an option for a short additional walk at the end to go to the top of Cemetery Hill (for those that crave a couple of contours) with some fine woodland and some great views, especially to the north, over part of the city, the Kessock Bridge, the Moray Firth and the Black Isle.\nPhotos:\ntaken by Rob Mitchell and used with permission.\nDogs are welcome on this walk.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Start your weekend early with a 9 mile circular mountain walk (720m ascent) through the North Pennines National Landscape to the summit of Cross Fell, the highest peak in The Pennines.  The walk starts from Kirkland, near Penrith, in Cumbria's beautiful Eden Valley.\nThe Pennines are known as the backbone of England.  They rise in the Peak District, south of Manchester, and run up to the Scottish Border.  This walk takes us to their highest point, Cross Fell, which presides majestically over the Eden Valley.  You will have seen it from the M6, the A66 and many Lakeland fells.  Cross Fell is also the highest point of the Pennine Way; the highest point in England outside the Lake District; the source of the mighty River Tees; and home to the UK's only named wind, the Helm Wind, which blows ferociously down its slopes in certain conditions (but hopefully not in August!).\nThe Eden Valley and the North Pennines are often overlooked due to their proximity to their much more famous neighbour on the other side of the M6, the Lake District National Park.  However, this is a beautiful area of unspoiled villages and farmland surrounded by fells on three sides, which more than deserves the walker's attention.  This being the height of August and school holiday madness in the Lakes, we thought this was the perfect time for Friday Fells to visit this quieter corner of Cumbria.\nThe walk starts in the hamlet of Kirkland and climbs to cross the summit plateau of Cross Fell, with its impressive cairn and summit shelter.  After visiting the source of The Tees, we'll descend by a different path to make a circular walk.\nIf we have a strong group and are making good time, we may add an out and back trip further along the ridge to another local landmark, the radar station on Great Dunn Fell.   You may have noticed this white golf ball like structure from the M6.  This radar station is operated by National Air Traffic Services and is a key part of the air traffic control system for Northern England and Southern Scotland.  This will add about 3 miles (1 hour) to the day.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at a local pub.\nYou can find the planned route\nhere\n, though we may be unable follow this exactly on the day.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell-trained dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the\nCountryside Code\n.

Outside, there is a large garden with beautiful views in every direction. If the weather is good we plan to have a  fire pit, marshmallows  and a chance to relax around a fire. If not don't worry, we have the cosy hostel for comfort, relaxing chatting, board games etc. There is no TV and WiFi is not brilliant, so a chance to socialise instead!\nThe small but well stocked village shop is a short walk away and provides all you may need, and there's a choice of excellent pubs in the village serving home cooked food.\nOn Friday night, we'll share the traditional OutdoorLads buffet (see food section) and Saturday and Sunday evenings will feature a home-cooked 2 course meal for us all to enjoy together (volunteers will be needed to chop, peel, grate etc). Continental style breakfasts are also provided on all 3 mornings, but you will need to bring your own packed lunch for Saturday and Sunday daytime (unless you are staying near the hostel in which case the village has pubs and cafes) .\nPARKING\n-\nThere is no parking on site\nFeel free to pull up at the hostel to drop your gear off though.\nYou can park in the village and surrounding area- just do so considerately . There are a couple of car parks as you enter Kettlewell   (£8 for up to 48 hours or thereabouts). On-street parking is limited, so arranging car sharing with others would be good.\nNote:\nBedding is provided. You may wish to bring your own pillow from home.\nDogs:\nThere will be two well-behaved dogs in attendance, unfortunately that is the maximum allowd so there are no more dog spaces available.\nPublic Transport\n- Kettlewell is on a\nbus route\nfrom Skipton or Grassington, or you could get a train to Skipton and arrange for a fellow attendee to give you a lift from there - most people will likely be passing through Skipton on their way.\nPhotos:\nBy L Russell and A Manion, and used by OutdoorLads with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful. All levels are welcome!\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome\n. If you're new to climbing, we've got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity. I keep our group tight-knit to foster connection and ensure personalised coaching for everyone, regardless of your experience level. Many climbers started their journeys relatively “late” in life, incl. some session leaders\n🤫\nWe convene at the\nClimbing Hangar in Reading\n, one of the largest climbing centres in the region. The generously spacious and friendly cafe/lounge is my personal favourite where you can find us socialising, having a cuppa, snacks or even pizza before and after the climbs.\nIf you have never climbed at the Climbing Hangar in Reading before, you must book an induction slot:\nhttps://www.theclimbinghangar.com/locations/reading\n- follow instructions to book an induction slot around the time that this event starts.\nYou also need to\ncomplete the waiver form that is linked in the confirmation email\nonce you've booked an induction slot.\nThis only needs to be done once.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This is a fairly level circular walk that sets off from picturesque Cotswold town of Bradford-on-Avon, notable for its 13th century Norman bridge flanked by large former cotton mills, nestled alongside the River Avon, and the Kennet and Avon Canal. While the walk route won't take us past the bridge, it is well worth a short trip into the town centre before or after the walk.\nFrom our start point we will set off south on the canal path before heading south west by Wild Brook and through open meadows and through Rufus wood towards Farleigh Hungerford Castle where we can take our lunch.  These medieval castle ruins where built in two stages. The inner court 1377 to 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford, steward to John of Gaunt. The second phase was completed around 1445 by Sir Thomas's son Walter Hungerford, who served with King Henry the 5th at the Battle of Agincourt.  Should anybody wish to, then there will be time to take a quick look inside the castle grounds during the lunch break, however English Heritage do charge an entrance fee to gain access to the ruins.\nAfter lunch we follow the River Frome north passing close to Iford Manor house whose origins may be as early as late 15th century. The classical manor house façade was added around 1730, and the hanging woodlands above the garden were planted later in the 18th century.\nFrom here we continue to the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon at Freshford before we arrive at the grade II listed Avoncliff Aqueduct which carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the River Avon and the Bath to Westbury railway line, and was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801.\nFor the final stage of the walk, we follow the River Avon and the Kennet and Avon canal back passing the spectacular 51 metre 14th Century monastic tythe barn of Barton Grange, which we can take a quick look inside, before arriving back in Bradford-on-Avon.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The mountains steep slopes are popular with the goats, so we may see them here.\nRhinog Fach:\nAt 712m, our second peak is everybit of rugged as the first, and summiting will be a good test of endurance, deep into the walk. Once on the summit we'll be greeted with more fantastic views, including the spectacular view back to Rhinog Fawr.\nLlyn Hywel:\nAs we return back from the mountains, we'll pass the beautiful Llyn Hywel, a natural lake with great views back to the mountain.

    "Title": "Day out to Suffolk Estuary Peninsula with Boat Trip & Walk",
    "Date": "Saturday Aug 30 2025",

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "22",
    "Summary": "Consider this maybe as more of a day out rather than just another walk!\nCome join our trip from Essex to Suffolk and back, including a return boat trip* to a lovely coastal peninsula, around which we will do a 10.6 mile (17km) walk. Much of it is through part of the Suffolk and Essex Coast Heaths national landscape and we'll be taking in two estuary rivers.\n(*Please note there is a charge of £15 per person payable for this event to cover the cost of the return boat trip needed to get to and from the Peninsula. The usual non-subscribed walk event fee of £12.50 will not be charged in addition for this event)\nOur day will commence initially on the Essex coast in the historic maritime port town of Harwich. Originating in the 13th Century, this is now the second busiest ferry and freight port in the UK. We however, will be embarking on a very much smaller craft (as pictured) from the quiet little Harwich Half Penny Pier Harbour for a 10-minute trip across the water to the Suffolk coastal Shotley Peninsula.\nFrom the attractive Shotley Point Marina, we'll then commence our circular walk. Initially heading along the harbourside and onto the outskirts of the small town of Shotley Gate, we'll then follow the banks of the Estuary River Stour. We'll follow the path as it meanders along the estuary banks until we head off across some lovely open Suffolk countryside across to the other side of the peninsula.\nWe'll then arrive at the small village of Chelmondiston - from where we'll head through some scenic low undulating woodland to get to the very pretty and rural estuary hamlet of Pin Mill. Aside from being a very cute place, Pin Mill is known best for its pub on the little quayside: The Butt and Oyster.\nOf course, we'll make a stop here to take in quayside views and some liquid refreshment. The pub is quite small and very popular for food, so eating there wouldn't be practical for us sadly, but we'll find somewhere in the vicinity to also enjoy our packed lunch.\nOnce refuelled, we'll make out way through the beautiful area known as the Cliff Plantation which, as the name suggests, is an old plantation woodland on some low-level cliffs alongside the Estuary River Orwell. Through the trees, there are glimpses of the water and some interesting wooden houseboats as we walk along the riverside path.\nThe continuing estuary side route then takes us on some boardwalks and paths with wide open views of the Estuary River Orwell. As we get closer back to our start point, there are impressive views of the busy Felixstowe Shipping Port across the other side of estuary, creating a unique mix of the rural path we'll be on with the industrial container port across the water.\nAs we arrive back at Shotley Point, we’ll wander through much more of the marina this time with great views of the boats and harbour activity.\nDepending on timings, we should then have time for another refreshment stop at a bar in the marina before we catch our return boat trip back across to Harwich.\n*Note - the high-level view photos of the Marina and the Butt and Oyster Pub setting are drone shots. But nevertheless, the views we'll get on the walk are lovely!\nIs it dog friendly?\n4 legged friends are welcome and are allowed on the boat crossing if you're happy to take them onboard, Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

    "Summary": "Come and join us as we march with\nPRIDE\nthrough the streets of Southampton, under Southampton Bargate and up Southampton high street, raising the profile of Outdoorlads not only in Southampton but also the wider south east region.\nIt is especially important to get as many OutdoorLads on the march as possible as this will be the first ever time OutdoorLads has participated in Southampton Pride. Considering the socials and walks that are held in and around Southampton I'm sure most will agree its important our presence is felt and our profile is raised.\nSouthampton's first Pride event was held in 1992, and was known as Solent Pride. Since then, in 2016 Southampton held its first Pride event in over a decade. This marked a significant event for Southampton's LGBTQ+ community. Since then Southampton has held a Pride annually, and it has grown to what we see today.\nWe will meet in Queens Park between\n10.30 - 10.45\n.\nThe march will leave Queens Park at\n11.00\nso its important to get there in good time. I would ask, if possible, to wear your red OutdoorLads t-shirts. If you don't have this, wear any other branded OutdoorLads clothing where possible. Of course, you are still welcome to join whatever you wear. Please bring OutdoorLads flags, whistles, rattles, anything to make noise and get us noticed. It is a protest after all! lol. Hopefully, we will be able to provide banners etc.\nThe march tends to last between 30-60 minutes before ending around Guildhall Square, where we will disperse. We may have a stall advertising OutdoorLads further, though this is yet to be determined. There will be performances from various artists on the main stage and a party atmosphere in the square which you are welcome to stay for. There will be other stalls and locals pubs and clubs in the vicinity. Bedford Place which is close by usually has a buzzing atmosphere.\nIt will be a very busy day, and I'm sure many local roads will be closed. I would strongly recommend to catch public transport into town where possible, and leave plenty of time for your journey, both in and out of Southampton.\nIt would be lovely to see as many people there as possible.\nWe will have an ODL stall in Southampton Guildhall.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.   We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.  This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat!  Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby.  This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food!  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories!  Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend.  The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.  From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location.  It is much easier to park in the village and walk down.  There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Llanthony in the Vale of Ewyas is one of those, and this is your chance to disconnect from the network for the weekend.\nOur accommodation for the weekend is a converted barn used to store the farms market cart, but now provides shelter and rustic charm.  There are no sofas or TVs and you'll need to bring your own sleeping bag and pillow case, but there are hot showers!\nThe itinerary for the weekend will be:\nFriday Evening:\nArrive and choose a bunk bed. Meet with the rest of the group around the enormous dining table and I'm sure someone will light the wood burner. Dinner will be included but will be simple for those that might not arrive till later (probably jacket potatoes with a range of fillings).\nSaturday Daytime:\nAfter breakfast, it will be time to explore some of the stunning countryside surrounding Llanthony.  Prepare for a climb as no matter which way you look, the site is surrounded by hills and mountains, and we will be going up at least one of these to reach the views from the ridge lines.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax and unwind. A simple dinner will be served and once we've cleared this away the board or card games will probably make an appearance. There's the option to walk the 50m or so to the cellar bar at Llanthony Priory or perhaps just read a book by that wood burner.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast we'll need to clean and tidy the barn, but once everything is packed away there will be an option to head to Longtown (either by foot or by car) for a Sunday lunch before heading home.\nTea and coffee will be available throughout the weekend but you'll need to bring a packed lunch for Saturday and anything else you may want to drink (The Cellar Bar does offer 2 Pint Takeouts of the draft beers)\nDogs:\nDue to the limited social and sleeping spaces this event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Celebrate diversity and inclusion with us as we march through the vibrant streets of York for one of the North’s most colourful and welcoming Pride events. Whether you're a regular or new to OutdoorLads, come along, show your pride, and enjoy a fun day of community, visibility, and adventure. All are welcome—let’s make it a day to remember! York Pride Parade is one of the longest in the country at 2.4 miles, and takes around 60-90 minutes to complete, so please wear appropriate comfortable footwear.\nThe parade ends at the Pride Festival site on Knavesmere, where you will be free to do what you want. There will be live entertainment on the Main Stage, a Cabaret Stage that has numerous local acts and usually some celebrity to headline with going on until about 7.00pm, Pride Market stall, plenty of food and drink vendors and even a fun fair. You can also bring your own food and drink if you want to make a picnic of it. It is a free event, but you can support it by buying a wristband.\nThere are usually a couple of after parties in the town centre and even a club night if you're up to it. (I probably won't stay after about 5.30pm, but I expect it'll be fairly busy in town ). More information can be found on York Pride website and FB pages.\nFrom the Knavesmire it's just 15 minutes walk back to York station.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Our hostel is nestled in the shadow of some of the most well known hills in the country - The Cuillins - tall, sharp and serious lumps of rocks that since the early days of british mountaineering have been a training ground for those planning trips to the Alps. Other wonders of Skye include the Quiraing, the Storr, Neist Point, Loch Coruisk and the Fairy Pools.\nWalk options will be dependant upon leaders attending and the weather. The Cuillins are notorious for collecting clouds so may not be an option unless we get lucky with the weather due to their technicality - the rock has a magnetic ability to play havoc with a compass so being able to see where you're going is a benefit.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nTaken by AMD and used with full permission.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nPlease note!

Expect bold red tees, big energy, and plenty of pride as we march through the city together.\n❤️ The Theme:\nLove\nThis year's\nManchester Pride Parade\ncelebrates\nLove\n– a powerful force that has helped LGBTQ+ people stand strong, live authentically, and support one another through times of adversity.\nLove has always been at the heart of our community\n. In the face of discrimination, rejection and marginalisation, love has given us courage, unity, and pride.\nJoin us at\nThe Love Parade\nas we march through the streets of Manchester, stopping the city in its tracks to shine a spotlight on queer love, acceptance, and the right to be exactly who we are.\n📍 The Plan\nMeet at 11:30am\nat\nCastlefield Roman Gardens\n(just off Liverpool Road, next to the White Lion Pub). See the “Location” section below for full details.\nWe’ll be easy to spot, just look for the red OutdoorLads T-shirts (which you’ll need to wear!).\nAs always, we want to showcase everything that makes OutdoorLads awesome, so if you're able, get involved by bringing gear that reflects your favourite activities:\nClimbers\n– Wear your harness. Bonus points for clipping on nuts, hexes or cams for a bit of jingly flair!\nCyclists / Mountain Bikers\n– Ride along-side on your bike. Bells and horns encouraged for extra fun!\nWalkers / Hikers\n– Walking poles, rucksacks, hydration bladders (contents at your discretion!) and massive OS maps are all welcome. Bonus points if you act lost and ask the crowd for directions.\nWe’ll also have\nflags to wave\n,\nstickers to hand out\n, and heaps of enthusiasm to share!\nMost importantly, don’t forget your red OutdoorLads T-shirt!\n🎟️ Parade Wristbands\nTo take part in the parade, you\nmust\ncollect a wristband from our muster point at Castlefield Roman Gardens.\nNo wristband = no parade entry.\nPlease arrive on time, as late arrivals last year struggled to get one.\n🚫\nPlease note:\nDogs are not allowed in the parade. This is a restriction set by the parade organisers.\n🌈 After the Parade\nWe’ll be spending time in the Village after the parade, both to socialise and to represent OutdoorLads to potential new members.\nWe'll likely break into small groups to chat to the public, hand out stickers and encourage sign-ups (ideally while enjoying a few drinks in the sunshine!).\n📍 Details of where to meet after the parade will be announced on the day.\nImportant:\nYou’ll need a separate\nGay Village Party or Mardi Gras Wristband\nto access the Village after the parade. Tickets for the Gay Village Party or Mardi Gras can be purchased\nhere\n.\nThe\nparade wristband does not\ngrant access to the Pride event, so we recommend getting your event wristbands in advance if you plan to join us in the Village afterwards.\nMore details will be added here and emailed to participants as plans develop.\nIt’s going to be another fantastic year.\nWe can’t wait to see you there!\n🎉\nOTHER PRIDE WEEKEND ACTIVITIES:\nManchester Pride 2025 - It's a Gay Knockout\n- Join us as we get ready to toss our handbags, chuck our sausages in the hoop or maybe don our finest heels and do us proud in the high heeled egg and spoon race!\nManchester Pride 2025 - Picnic in the Park\n- Join OutdoorLads for a picnic in the park to celebrate Manchester Pride!\nManchester Pride Parade - The Social\n- Join us this August Bank Holiday as we soak up the electric atmosphere of Manchester Pride 2025!\nManchester Pride 2025 - The Vigil\n- Join OutdoorLads as we come together for one of the most moving and meaningful moments of the Manchester Pride weekend — the Candlelit Vigil in Sackville Gardens.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It's a beautiful area and over the weekend we can do some great hikes, relax and have a few beers around the campfire.\nOur venue for the weekend is a little village not far from the pretty town of Dartmouth, with miles of the stunning South West Coast Path stretching out in either direction. It's a perfect spot for hiking, chilling, and exploring.\nOn Saturday and Sunday we'll probably hike along the coast. Expect plenty of up and downs but also some spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way, with wooded valleys, rocky coves and stunning beaches including Slapton Sands and Blackpool Sands.\nThe spacious campsite was once used as an airfield by American marines to practice for the D-Day landings. Sadly the marines have long gone, but the campsite is in a great spot and we'll have our own field just for us! There's toilets, hot showers (20p for 5 mins), a small kitchen (with fridge) and washing up sinks. Camp fires and BBQs are allowed providing they are off the ground.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on the campsite but will need to be on a lead. Dogs are £1 a night, payable directly to the site on arrival. Well behaved OutdoorLads too please...this isn’t a party event and we'll need to be quiet after 11pm (the owners are super strict about this).\nThere's a couple of pubs a short stroll away and Slapton Sands beach is a further ten minutes down the road.  There’s a clothing optional beach too, if that’s your thing.\nPhotos:\nAll photos from OutdoorLads Members and permission is given for use by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident and experienced road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington.

An alternative is to bypass the section on a quieter and less-trafficked, but still steep (down) in places country lane.  We can decide on the day what we'd prefer.\nPateley Bridge is the perfect place to stop for a cream tea, and to refuel for the next climb. It's also the home of the\nOldest Sweet Shop in the World\n- super sour fizz balls, anyone?  The road out of town leads to\nBrimham Rocks\n, a National Trust-owned property with weird and wonderful rock formations we may briefly cycle through.\n8km further on we cycle through the grounds of the stunning\nFountains Abbey\nWorld Heritage Site - a stunning assembly of history: the ruined Cistercian abbey, the landscape gardens, the medieval deer park before reaching\nRipon\n, where we'll stop for lunch. (A 10km shorter route bypasses Fountains Abbey and Ripon, with lunch in Bishop Monkton instead - we'll decide before we set off which route to take).\nAfter lunch the Way of the Roses meanders down the Ouse River valley, along quiet country lanes before crossing the Ouse on the rickety Aldwark Toll Bridge, which is free for cyclists.  The route is almost entirely flat between Ripon and York, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be\nchallenging\n:\n98km (61 miles) with 1000m (3,280ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident and experienced road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(Shorter route on\nCycle.Travel here\n).\n**\nYou will need to book your own accommodation in York, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in York.  Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn City Centre (Layerthorpe).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL; Image 6: Aldwark Toll Bridge\n© Andrew Whale and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; all other images Pixabay Public Domain.",
