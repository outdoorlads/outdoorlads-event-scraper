    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced (independent) climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners (supervised) event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!  Beginner (supervised) events are offered every two weeks only; this enables the event leader to climb too.\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

Approximately 5 1/2 hours, including lunch.\nThis walk includes sections that are relatively flat (riverside), a fairly challenging ascent, hillside with panoramic views, and the delightful town of Middleton-in-Teesdale. Although it is long and in places, strenuous, it's well worth the effort.\nStarting from the High Force Hotel, we descend towards the River Tees. We cross the river and follow its course past the stunning Low Force waterfall. We then cross the river again via a narrow suspension bridge to reach Bowlees. This is where the ascent begins.\nThe next section of the walk passes through several farms, before crossing open hillside. As we begin to descend, we pass through woodland and follow Hudeshope Beck towards Middleton-in-Teesdale.\nWe cross the town, and there are several places to purchase refreshments, if required. We then cross the River Tees again, before following it's course back to the start point. This does mean repeating a small section of the riverside that we covered in the morning.\nAfter the walk, there will be an optional trip to The High Force Hotel in Forest in Teesdale for anyone who would like a drink.\nPlease note that this walk does NOT include High Force waterfall. If you wish to visit this, tickets cost £3.95 for adults. As winter access is 10am-3pm, you would need to visit before the 10:30 am walk start time. You can find further information on the\nRaby website\n.\nDogs: Well-behaved, under control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. Many stretches of this walk include sheep roaming. I would also note that there are quite a few up-and-over wall stiles towards the end of the walk, so you get a bit of an upper-body workout lifting your dogs over them.

We will have time to visit properly and are booked in.\nThe Inns of Court\nAll barristers must belong to an Inn of Court, and the plan is to walk through all four of them - Lincoln’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, Middle and Inner Temples. This is why the walk is on a weekday. We won’t be able to visit the chapels/great halls, but will pass the impressive barristers’ chambers and gardens, which have the feel of historical Oxbridge colleges.\nChancery Lane and Fleet Street\nThere will be plenty of zig-zagging through the alleys and courtyards of legal London. We should be able to pass St Ethelburga’s Chapel, the old red brick Victorian Gothic Prudential Building and Dr Johnson’s House, where he compiled the Dictionary of the English Language. Fleet Street is the original home of London printing and the press.\nSt Bride’s Church\nThe reconstructed Christopher Wren church is known as the journalists’ church. Its spire may have inspired traditional tiered wedding cakes, and is only exceeded by St Paul’s Cathedral in the City. We may be able to see the memorial to the first known victim of Jack the Ripper and visit the crypt with its Roman pavement.\nTwo Temple Place\nBuilt for Lord Astor (who was one of the richest men in the world) as his office around 1895, with neo-Gothic wooden carvings and windows. It opens for an annual exhibition. This year’s is “Weight of Being: Vulnerability, Resilience and Mental Health in Art” which we are booked in for and will visit.\n—-\nDogs - sorry, no dogs are permitted at these sights.\nToilets at each indoor sightseeing stop.\nThe\nroute\ncan be seen on the\nOS Map -\nClick here\n- which is included for guidance only.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day.\nWhilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse",

    "Summary": "My Lord! Your challenge is to conquer the peaks of the Manifold Valley, adding up to 1000 metres of ascent over the day. Along the way you will see much superb scenery of the White Peak, limestone shining in the spring light. The challenge culminates above Thor's cave, marking your Lordship over the whole valley!\nThis difficult hill route follows many steep slopes, making use of access land and permissive paths at times, as well as scrambly banks, so you will need to be comfortable with this kind of walk. We aim to cover the three tops of Wetton Hill, (319m 355m 328m), Ecton Hill (369m), Ecton South top (360m), Dale above Sugar Load (325m), Ossoms Hill (334m) and Thor's Height (294m). The rewards for this are that you will have accomplished an amazing challenge and experienced some unbeatable and incredible views of Thor's cave and the Manifold Valley. The walk southwards on a hidden route towards the impending Thor's cave is particularly spectacular.\nEcton Hill at the north end of our route was the centre of historic copper mines and a wealthy earner for local miners. There are information boards near the mine remains. We'll also see the small cave at Wettonmill, where there is a tearoom, which we will pass mid-afternoon.\nFrom Ossom's Hill we head onward with giant Thor looming ahead, cross the Manifold river and head up a path with a long flight of steps. The cave itself is huge, slippy and scrambly. After the cave, we will go further to circle the giant's lair and come out on top, above the cave, for all round views of the valley.\nThis is as difficult as hill walks get and is pretty much the same as a mountain walk, and certainly good preparation for one, We may adjust the walk according to weather conditions, and there will be an opportunity to miss a peak if you're tired, but please come ready for a challenge. A recent OutdoorLads hill walk would be excellent preparation!\nIf bad weather, we may shorten the route to 500m ascent, but will still include Thor's cave. Note that if you just wanted to see Thor's cave without the rest of the challenge, you might be better choosing a hillwalk focused on that alone, which is offered by OutdoorLads leaders regularly, if not often.\nWell behaved dogs who are fit enough to manage this challenge are welcome to accompany us on this walk.\nNote:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\nPictures: taken by Outdoorlads members, free to reuse.",

It's run on paths and grass, although some sections of the course do accumulate mud, leaves and puddles after rain.  Dependent on availability, marshals will be at key sections of the course, or signs will be in place.\nThe important bit... This is about personal goals. You run/walk at your own pace, don't be scared that you may be slower than other people.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a mud-free stroll along London's historic South Bank. Starting at Waterloo Station, we'll follow the river eastwards as far as Tower Bridge, then cross over to finish at Tower Hill tube station.\nThe linear walk will include a long lunch stop at the fascinating Tate Modern art gallery, giving an opportunity to explore the extensive collections. Entry to Tate Modern and most of the exhibits is free of charge.\nThe sights:\nWaterloo Station\n: This is the London terminus for the South Western railway and services to Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Weymouth & Exeter along with south London commuter services. It is the largest station in Britain, has the most platforms (24), and is the second busiest. First built in 1848, it was reconstructed in 1922 and again in the 1990s to provide Eurostar services.\nNational Windrush Monument\n: Bronze statue by Basil Watson unveiled in 2022 to commemorate the British Afro-Caribbean people to came to Britain on the Empire Windrush in 1948.\nJubilee Gardens\n: This was the site of the Dome of Discovery & the Skylon at the 1951 Festival of Britain. It was created in 1977 and redeveloped in 2012. It is surrounded by County Hall, the London Eye & the Shell Centre. It includes a memorial to the British members of the International Brigades who fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War.\nSouthbank Centre\n: This comprises the Royal Festival Hall (the only surviving structure from the Festival of Britain), the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room & Hayward Gallery. It is the largest centre for the arts in Britain. Underneath is a large undercroft which is feted as the birthplace of British skateboarding.\nNational Theatre\n: The theatre was founded in 1963 by Laurence Olivier and was originally based at The Old Vic in south London, until its new permanent home on the South Bank was opened in 1976. The building is Grade II* listed, and is seen as a masterpiece of brutalist architecture. It contains three theatre spaces - the Olivier, Lyttelton & Dorfman.\nOxo Tower\n: The tower was originally part of a huge cold store built by Lemco, the manufacturers of Oxo stock cubes, in 1928-9. When permission was refused for illuminated advertising signs on a tower, Lemco build the Oxo name into the windows on the four sides.\nTate Modern\n: Converted from the former Bankside power station, Tate Modern houses the UK's national collection of modern & contemporary art. When the power station closed in 1981, the building was under threat of demolition until it was chosen as the new home for Tate Modern in 1994. The gallery was opened in 2000, with a 10-storey extension, the Blavatnik Building, following in 2016. It has around 4 million visitors a year.\nShakespeare's Globe\n: This is a faithful reconstruction of The Globe theatre built 250 yards away in 1599. It was the brain-child of the American film director Sam Wanamaker, who fought for over 20 years to get a replica Elizabethan open-air theatre built in London. It opened in 1997, and stages Shakespeare plays during the summer months to a capacity of 1,400.\nThe Clink Prison Museum\n: This recreates the conditions of The Clink, a prison which operated nearby under the control of the Bishops of Winchester between 1144 & 1780.\nWinchester Palace: This was the townhouse of the Bishops of Winchester from 1136 until its destruction by fire in 1814. Today, the west gable end with its rose window survive as a scheduled ancient monument.\nThe Golden Hinde\n: Not Sir Francis Drake's famous ship of 1577, but a full-sized 1973 replica built by traditional methods at Appledore in Devon. Like the original, she has circumnavigated the world, but since 1996 has been dry-docked at St Mary Overie Dock.\nSouthwark Cathedral\n: There has been a church on this site for 1,000 years, with the present structure being built between 1220 & 1420 and reconstructed in the 19th century. It was a priory church till the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, then a parish church, before being raised to cathedral status in 1905 with the creation of the new diocese of Southwark.\nHay's Galleria\n: Constructed its present form as Hay's Wharf in 1861, it has survived wartime bombing and post-war disuse to become, in 1987, an office & retail complex.\nHMS Belfast\n: A Town-class light cruiser, she was launched in 1938 and served on the Arctic convoys, the Battle of North Cape (1943), the D-Day landings, and the Korean War. After decommissioning, she became a museum ship and is now a part of the Imperial War Museum.\nTower Bridge:\nThis is a combined bascule & suspension bridge, which, since its completion in 1894, has become one of the most iconic sights in the capital. Grade I listed, it still carries 40,000 vehicles a day.\nTower of London\n: Begun in 1078 by William the Conqueror and largely complete by 1285, the Tower has served for nearly 1,000 years as a palace, fortress, prison, armoury, treasury and even a menagerie. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular visitor attractions in Britain.\nRoman Wall:\nJust by the entrance to Tower Hill tube station stands one of the few remaining sections of the wall that once surrounded Roman London. Most of the wall was demolished in the 18th & 19th centuries, but a few fragments have survived, either free-standing or as part of other buildings.\nDogs\nOnly guide/assistance dogs are allowed inside Tate Modern, making the walk unsuitable for ordinary dogs unless you are prepared to forego this part of the event.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nPhotos\n: Tate Modern (main) / The Shard / Windrush Monument (meeting point) / London Eye / Southbank Centre / National Theatre / Oxo Tower / Turbine Hall, Tate Modern / St Paul's from Tate Modern / Shakespeare's Globe / Clink Prison Museum / Winchester Palace / The Golden Hinde / Southwark Cathedral / Hays Galleria / HMS Belfast / Tower Bridge / White Tower, Tower of London / Roman Wall, Tower Hill.\nAll photos taken by leader 19th January 2026 and permission given to OutdoorLads for use.",

This 6.5-mile circular route is the perfect way to share the outdoors with friends old and new—because nothing says \"Valentine's\" like falling head over heels for stunning scenery!\nOur walk begins near Chirk and takes us through a mix of open pastures, peaceful woodland, and riverside paths. Expect a few steep slopes and stiles along the way.\nWe'll start by wandering through the historic grounds of Chirk Castle, a place that has stood the test of time—just like true love. From there, we join the legendary Offa's Dyke Path, where sweeping views of the Ceiriog Valley will make you stop and stare (and maybe snap a romantic selfie or two).\nAs we continue, the route leads us to the impressive Chirk Aqueduct and Viaduct, marvels of engineering that bridge more than just rivers—they connect landscapes and stories. And if that's not enough to make your heart flutter, the tranquil riverside paths and rolling pastures will surely do the trick.\nThis is Daniel’s assessment walk, so Daniel will be leading.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn’t have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. With climbs of various grades suitable for complete beginners to seasoned pros, you decide how much you wish to challenge yourself.\nIf you have not visited the Stronghold Centre before, it is recommended that you\npre-register online\nprior to your first visit. Please watch the online introduction video as you may be asked a few easy questions to complete your registration at the centre.\nWe look forward to seeing you at what is always a fun event.\nIf you are new to bouldering you are welcome to join us at our regular weekly Thursday evening and Saturday morning indoor bouldering sessions which are open to all levels.\nAll those attending must also be aware of the centre’s own T&C’s etc. You are responsible at all times for your own safety, actions and involvement.

It takes in Darley Park and Allestree Park to the north of Derby city centre, and we visit the Shiny Brewery Tap at Little Eaton where award winning beers are created. Non-alcoholic beverages are available.\nAt the start of the walk we cross the river at Handyside Bridge, also known as Derwent Bridge, built in 1878 for the Great Northern Railway. The railway line closed in 1968 and it was converted to a foot bridge in 1976.\nOn the western side of the river we walk past Derby Rowing Club, formed in 1857.\nDarley Park\nis home to the largest collection of Hydrangeas in Britain, and the third largest in the world. First planted in 1984 it now has over 400 different types, however, there won't be many blooms to see in March.\nWe will pause to take refreshments at Darley Park Tearooms.\nThe settlement of\nDarley Abbey\ndates back to the medieval era, when it was the site of an Augustinian monastery. In the 18th century, the Evans family developed their planned industrial mill village to service their Boar's Head Mill, one of the first water-powered mills at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.\nWe cross over the busy A6 through the suburb of Allestree and into Allestree Park from where we get great views into the Derwent valley. From here we continue uphill to Quarndon, one of the wealthiest villages in the area.\nFrom Bunkers Hill we head back down into the valley, back across the A6, past St Alkmund's Church and over Duffield Bridge towards Little Eaton.\nShiny Brewery was established in 2012 as a small-scale cask brewery operation in the beer garden at the back of the Furnace Inn pub in Derby. It moved to Little Eaton in 2015 and invested in making better beer which is now available nation-wide in cask, keg and cans as well as from the taproom.\nThe Shiny Tap\nalso sells pizzas if you fancy one in the afternoon as well as, or instead of, a packed lunch.\nFrom Little Eaton we cross underneath the A38 ring road on the Derwent Valley Heritage Way and back through Darley Park and Little Chester to the start point.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nNote:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central",

It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council.

This route mixes wide forest tracks with open, windswept heath, offering big skies, quiet corners, and plenty of space to stomp out the winter blues. Bracing, a little wild, and best enjoyed with rosy cheeks and a well-earned beer or hot drink at the end.\nThe route is essentially a loop around Swinley Forest, which is one of the most popular areas of wild open space in the Bracknell/Camberley area. This is a popular leisure area so no doubt there will be other walkers, families and mountain bikers around, however we will also take a few quieter paths to get away from the masses.\nThere are no stiles on the entire route and the walk is suitable for\ndogs\n.\nWe will commence walking through Bagshot Village, taking Church Lane past St Anne's church and Vicarage Road which leads to a 2km dead straight track into Swinley Forest, past open areas and pine trees. We continue North until the end of the forest area and then West to the LookOut Discovery Centre where we will stop for lunch. After lunch we then go South via the Windsor RRide and the Lower Star Post and when we reach Saddleback Hill go East back towards Bagshot.\nThe route can be found\nhere\n:\nHere is some of the features of the route:\nSwinley Forest\nis a large, tranquil woodland in Berkshire, dominated by tall Scots pine and criss-crossed by wide, sandy tracks. It sits on the edge of Windsor Great Park, an area with deep royal heritage, and was once part of the historic Windsor Forest that served the Crown for centuries as hunting and woodland estate. Today, Swinley Forest is managed for both forestry and recreation, giving it a spacious, open feel with plenty of light filtering through the trees. Popular with walkers, runners, and cyclists, it offers gentle gradients, peaceful routes, and a sense of stepping into a quietly regal landscape just beyond the surrounding towns.\nBagshot Heath\nis an area of lowland heathland in Surrey and Berkshire, England, historically part of the wider Windsor Forest and Great Park. It’s known for its sandy soils, open heath, and wildlife, including heathland birds and reptiles. Much of it is now protected or managed for conservation, recreation, and military use.\nBagshot village\nis a historic village in Surrey, located near the border with Berkshire. It developed as a coaching stop on the main London–Exeter road and later grew with the arrival of the railway. Prince Edward lives with his family at Bagshot Park, a large Grade II–listed mansion set in about 51 acres.",

Where will 2026 take us..? 🪩\nIn the clubhouse you'll also find the facilities like bathrooms and showers, and generally where you'll find the event organisers if you have any questions.\nThe Outdoor Inn is our more quiet bar area, located around the back of the clubhouse in a big marquee. A good place to chill out, play some board games, or just catch up with that guy you haven't seen since this time last year!\n🍔 Food & Fuel\nNo need to survive on cereal bars alone. You can do it yourself by your tent (just keep those stoves and BBQs off the grass!). Or, you can use our clubhouse catering. We'll have a range of hot breakfasts, delicious evening meals, snacks and grab-and-go packed lunches for your adventures.\n⛺ Tents & Campervans\nTents:\nMost folks bring their own, but if you're new to camping, we have a\nlimited number of\ntents to hire\nfor a small fee.\nCampervans/Caravans:\nSpace is extremely limited (approx. 20 spots). These must be pre-booked and tend to sell out in minutes. So, set your alarms for the booking date, which will be advised in due course - likely to be late February. As this is a rugby club, there's no EHU or waste disposal facilities.\n📜 Rules to Keep Everybody Happy\nThe\nOutdoorLads Code of Conduct\napplies to everyone at all times.\nRespect the grass:\nThis is a rugby club first and foremost. So, no glass, no dogs,  no BBQs/stoves on the grass, and no open fires (other than the 'official' campfire).\nDrugs:\nZero tolerance to illegal substances. Anyone suspected of having drugs will be asked to leave immediately.\nSmoking and vaping:\nNot permitted anywhere in the clubhouse or marquee.\nQuiet Time:\nNoisy fun in the bars; quiet in the camping fields between\n23:00 and 07:00\n. Tents have zero soundproofing.\nSpacing:\n2 meters between tents for fire safety.\nWaste:\nSort your recycling before binning - this is the law in Wales. Don't leave any rubbish lying around. Large items like broken camping chairs need to go home with you to be disposed of.\nVehicles:\nNo cars outside the permitted car park areas. No EV charging on site.\nDay visitors\n: There are no day passes available. You must be booked on to this event to attend BIG Spring Camp for any duration of time.\nNew to OutdoorLads?\n: If you're new (or relatively new) to OutdoorLads and worried about not knowing anybody when you get to BIG Spring Camp, then worry not! You can join one of our smaller new member camps, led by some of our amazing, approachable volunteers, who'll help introduce you to others on the first evening. You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent. Just makes that intro to the event and to OutdoorLads that much easier! We'll make details available nearer the time.\nSpread the cost:\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. The full cost must have been paid by 1st May 2026.\nOutdoorLads Foundation:\nDon't forget that full and concession members who may be experiencing physical, mental or financial challenges can apply for support with the costs of events themselves, or associated spend, to enable fuller participation. Further details on the\nFoundation pages on our website\n.\nPhotos:\nProvided by OutdoorLads members and volunteers, and used with permission.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs and they are not permitted on site at any time.",

    "Summary": "Join Paul on this leisurely social bike ride starting from Central Manchester.\nThe 17 mile circular route starts with a brief venture through the heart of the City Centre, passing the Palace Theatre, the iconic Central Library and the Opera House on our way to Salford Central station via Spinningfields. Next, we will head out past Salford Cathedral and Salford University to discover the safer cycling route that runs along the busy East Lancs Road towards Worsley.\nThe route then follows a former railway loopline to Monton, where we have the option of a pub/snack stop. Finally, we will join the Bridgewater Canal which takes us past the Trafford Centre and Old Trafford all the way back to the city centre.\nPace and Terrain\nThis will be a leisurely ride, suitable for all levels of fitness. We'll aim to maintain a steady pace of around 10mph.  The route is relatively flat with level surfaces, apart from a few short, cobbled bits. Suitable for any roadworthy bike. Please make sure your bike is in good condition - check the tyres are well inflated, chain is oiled, and you've got a spare inner tube, drinks and snacks with you.\nThe first part of the ride includes roads, but once out of the city centre we have the option of using shared cycle/footpaths and cycle/bus lanes which offer protection from the traffic. The second part of the ride, once we are on the loopline is almost all off road, There's just a short on-road stretch where we will have to leave and rejoin the Bridgewater Canal to cross the Barton Road Swing Bridge.\nPhotos\ntaken by the ride leader and used with permission.",

Our whistlestop tour shares some highlights of the last quarter millennium of Manchester’s queer history.\nManchester’s iconic Gay Village may be the beating heart of the LGBTQ+ community but there’s plenty of queer history and culture to see and hear about, in addition to Canal Street.\nOur walking tour takes a circuit through the city centre of around 3 miles / 5 kilometres.  It’s pavement walking so comfortable footwear is recommended together with warm / waterproof clothing, depending on the weather!\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs may come on the walk, but must be on a lead and under close control at all times.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to come, add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.  This event will be repeated in the future.\nPhoto credits\n: photos by ODL members with permission given to OutdoorLads for their use.",

Look out for Part II on 28 March and Part III on 11 April.\nWaitlist: If this event is fully booked, but you'd like to attend, please add yourself to the waitlist. Places often become available closer to the date\n.\nJoin me as we take a trip around central London exploring my favourite Art Deco buildings and other architectural delights along the way. I'm by no means an expert, but I do love Art Deco and different styles of architecture and I will endeavour to provide some background about each building from my own research. We'll also pass a number of historic monuments and other notable places of interest.\nWalking route and itinerary\nThis is a\nlinear walk\nstarting at London Bridge Station and ending near Blackfriars rail and underground stations.\nThis\nroute map\ncan be viewed in OS Maps, but is for guidance only. The exact route may differ slightly on the day due to construction work.\nAfter a short introduction to the different Art Deco architectural styles, our first building is directly opposite us -\nSt Olaf House\n(1928)\n. We'll have a look at its inscriptions and ornate entrance before making our way to London Bridge via Queens Walk. Crossing the River Thames we'll stop to admire the view of the City of London and look back at Hayes Wharf. Our second Art Deco building is\nAdelaide House\n(1925)\n, which is currently undergoing renovation. Photos will be shown.\nNext we pass the\nMonument\n(1671)\n, then head up onto Eastcheap to admire the many different architectural styles, with the\nWalkie-Talkie or 20 Fenchchurch Street\nbuilding dominating the skyline. We'll pass Tower Hill Station and view a section of the\nRoman London Wall\ntucked behind a hotel. Our third Art Deco building is the spectacular\nIbex House\n(1937)\n. We'll then pass a number of skyscrapers in the City and make our way to the imposing\nGuildhall\n(1411)\n,\nvia the Bank of England.\nAfter a short walk, we arrive at\nThe Barbican\nEstate\n(1965)\n, where we can stop for about an hour to have some lunch, you can view the\ncurrent exhibition\nor visit the conservatory or walk around this unique brutalist estate.\nOur fourth Art Deco masterpiece is\nFlorin Court\n(1936)\nin the historic Charterhouse Square, before we head past Smithfield Market towards  Farringdon Street. After navigating around a construction site we pass through some secluded alleyways to Fleet Street. Our fifth and sixth Art Deco buildings are the former\nDaily Telegraph\n(1928)\n(currently under some scaffolding) and\nDaily Express (\n1930)\nbuildings\n.\nNote there's not much room to stand here due to the major construction works opposite, so take care.\nThe final part of the walk takes us to the Embankment, where we can admire our seventh and final Art Deco building the\nOxo Tower (\n1928\n)\nand Sea Containers House across the river. It's then a 2 min walk to Blackfriars train and underground station.\nAfterwards\nOptional local drinks at the Retro bar or in Soho for anyone who wishes to join me.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day.\nAll Images were taken by Neil Prior.",

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Join us for an evening of culture at All Saints Church Ecclesall with the Sheffield Symphony Orchestra, featuring our very own Andy Ling on the viola.\nGuest conductor:\nJason Thornton\n-\nJason Thornton is the Music Director of Bath Philharmonia. He has conducted orchestras throughout the UK, Europe, America and the Far East, including the RPO, London Mozart Players, City of London Sinfonia, Beijing Symphony Orchestra, Jykasyla Sinfonia (Finland) and the Kaposvar Symphony Orchestra (Hungary).\nPiano Soloist:\nJeneba Kanneh-Mason\n-\nJeneba was a Keyboard Category Finalist in BBC Young Musician 2018, winner of the Murs du Son Prize at the Lagny-Sur-Marne International Piano Competition in France, 2014, and The Nottingham Young Musician 2013. She was also winner of the Iris Dyer Piano Prize at The Royal Academy of Music, Junior Academy, where she studied with Patsy Toh.\nBeethoven’s 3rd piano concerto\nHis first in a minor key, also seen as a bridge between the Classical period governed by structure and form, and the Romantic which spoke to the heart and depicted emotions. At the premiere in 1803, Beethoven's page turner almost had a heart attack when he turned the page during the performance and the score was empty - Beethoven hadn't yet gone completely deaf (but had lost about 60% at this point) and was playing the solo part from memory.\nDvorak - Symphony no. 8 in G major\nApparently reminiscent of a summer's day in the country, with rustic melodies to get you dancing, birdsong and even a thunderstorm.\nWagner - Prelude to Act III of Lohengrin\nAct 3 of Lohengrin is when the wedding takes place. However, as with all opera, it's not over till the fat lady sings and there is lots of tension and tears to come before the final curtain falls.\nTickets can be purchased online\non the SSO website\nan will also be available on the door. The cost is £18.50.\nWe will go for a drink at a nearby pub after the concert.\nImage credits  Main Image - Andy Ling; Image 1 - Samual  Sianipar  (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 2: -Samuel Ramos (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 3  Mea Morrowhart (free to use under the unsplash license)",

These caves offer a unique glimpse into the area's geological and human past. Continuing our journey, we’ll discover Catrigg Force, a secluded waterfall in a tranquil woodland glade. The twin plunges of water provide a peaceful spot to relax and appreciate nature's beauty.\nAs we approach Stainforth, we'll then encounter the Hoffman Kilns, remnants of the region's industrial heritage. These towering structures, once used for lime burning, stand as a testament to the area's history. This walk is a perfect blend of natural beauty and historical intrigue, making it an ideal walk.

    "Summary": "Join Outdoors as we celebrate our\n20th Birthday\nat Winter Camp in the heart of the Lakes District, back to where it all began in 2006.  Whether you have been around since that time or joined us recently, all are welcome. Winter Camp was OutdoorLads' first EVER event back in 2006 and the perfect place to kick off our year of celebratory events! This year we are making it bigger and better than ever, with a choice of tents, pods, campervans or a hostel to bring together as many members as possible to launch the celebrations!\nThis event page\nDOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ACCOMMODATION\n.\nIt is for those coming for the activities only - walks and the Saturday evening social\nevent at a local pub, which includes dinner. Hence this page is for those who live locally, or have booked your own accommodation separately.\nWith the towering Langdale Pikes looming above it, our campsite is a particularly dramatic spot to pitch up for an adventure in the outdoors. The award-winning site offers a wide selection of grassy pitches as well as a collection of wooden camping pods. It boasts two newly upgraded toilet and shower blocks, washing-up areas, a laundry and drying room.\nThe name should give it away, but this is camping in the winter and so it will be cold! While it's not for the faint hearted, equally it's not out of reach of anyone. It goes without saying that you'll need to make good preparations to keep warm and dry all weekend, but having done that, you'll find that winter camping can be a great experience. Think mountain view, cold, and if you're lucky some snow, but also think roaring fires in great pubs with hearty food, good conversation with new and old friends, all making a memorable weekend.\nOn the Saturday there'll be a range of walk and activity options of varying difficulties. They will vary depending on the conditions at the time, but in this part of the country, every walk is a stunner and there are lots of options - very likely there will be a harder mountain walk and something a bit easier, but there will still be lots of ascent involved - this is the Lake District after all.\nOn the Sunday we hope you'll stay around for another, shorter walk. We aim to be finished around mid-afternoon.\nDepending on the conditions, there may also be the opportunity to learn/improve your winter walking skills as we have three great winter walking leaders on hand to share their knowledge and experience.\nOur campsite has great onsite facilities including a cafe serving early morning breakfast snacks and some truly great showers which are free to use, heated by the onsite Biomass boiler. Truly environmentally friendly! You will need to provide your own food EXCEPT for Saturday evening, as that meal is included in the price!\nBirthday Celebrations\nOn the Saturday evening at we plan to visit a nearby pub who are preparing us dinner, and a private space for a bit of a social evening.  The food is included in the event price, and there are options provided for those with dietary requirements, don't worry! (You will need to have your dietary requirements up to date on the event page please, or we cant guarantee to be able to cater for different needs on the night.)  Obviously drinks are at your own cost that night.\nThis is a great chance to relax with your OutdoorLads friends, reminisce over the last 20 years,  laugh about the good times, the bad fancy dress decisions and the challenging climbs!\nDogs\n: Well behaved dogs are welcome, must remain on a lead on site and owners will need to clean up after them. Dogs listed under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 are not permitted at National Trust campsites.\nPhotos:\nTaken by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

A good mix of woodland paths, grassland and quiet tarmac roads.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nWe'll leave Littlehaven station and slowly work our way towards Rusper village. On the way we'll enjoy a varied Sussex landscape taking in farmland, woodland and rolling green fields. One highlight will be passing the site of the former Priory for the Benedictine nuns. The Priory has long since gone but the vast site now contains buildings known as the Nunnery. Lunch will be in Rusper where we can enjoy an in depth look at the history of the village. It really is one of those places where every where you look that is a story to learn.\nFollowing lunch we'll take a walk back to Littlehaven on a different route to our approach. Again, this will offer more lovely views, interesting landscapes and varied terrain. As we get nearer to the end there will be a well earned pub stop at The Frog and Nightgown. As with much of the walk this pub has an interesting history. It was originally only able to accommodate 10 people before changes took place merging two cottages and extending the bar area. Just before we arrive back at our start point there is a chance to take in another interesting church and its history.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend.

    "Summary": "Join Alex for this ten-mile hike across Hertfordshire hills and heaths.\nOur route begins in the North Hertfordshire town of Royston, which lies on the Icknield Way, an ancient road believed to be one of Britain's oldest. We will follow the route of the Icknield Way south out of the town centre and skirt the edge of Therfield Heath, a nature reserve with wide-ranging views as far as Cambridge to the north.\nWe will head into open countryside gradually ascending to the pleasant village of Therfield. From here our route will take a loop around the small settlement of Kelshall, via the grounds of St Faith's churchyard. Upon leaving Kelshall we will return to Therfield heading towards the tower of St Mary's church where we will stop for lunch.\nHeading north, we will descend sharply and may glimpse red kites and herds of deer as we drop down into the farmland below. We will then veer uphill once more and turn east towards Fox's Covert nature reserve, where we will wander through woodlands interspersed with open country views to the north.\nFinally, avoiding any stray balls from the local golf club, we will head across Therfield Heath itself. We will pass a number of long barrows, ancient neolithic earthworks, and may see the rare pasqueflower, which blooms around Easter and is only found in a few places in the UK. From Therfield Heath it is a short descent back towards the station.\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring means lots of members looking to get out more so please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nNew members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome but please bear in mind not everyone likes dogs as much as you.

    "Summary": "'Best' is subjective, of course, but Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was voted top for 'The Best Crime Author' on the Ranker website in 2020, and on this fresh take on some classic New Forest scenery you can see his grave. Sir Arthur was originally buried in a vertical position in Crowborough in Sussex and re-interred in Minstead by the family of his deceased first wife after the death of the second Lady Conan Doyle. Initially resistant because of his spiritualism, the Church of England, ever flexible, relented, and here he is, interred beneath a large tree, a Holmesian calabash pipe sometimes resting beside his gravestone.\nOther curios in Minstead include the name and sign of the pub, The Trusty Servant. An American author in the 19th century described the figure 'which emblematically sets forth those virtues in domestics, of which we Americans know nothing. It is a figure, part man, part porker, part deer, and part donkey; with a padlock on his mouth, and various other symbols in his hands and about his person, the whole signifying a most valuable character.' The padlock connotes diplomacy; the donkey's ears, humility; the deer hooves, alacrity; the pig's face, omnivory; the open hand, honesty; the tools, industry. The figure and name is based on a mural from 1579 at Winchester College, but the link with the school has never been established.\nLeaving behind all that's quaint and queer in Minstead, which includes the whitewashed cottages and 13th and 18th century church of All Saints (which has two large galleries,  a three-decker pulpit, and an unusual 'luxury' pew, complete with its own fireplace), we'll set out into the forest, following this\nroute\n(please click the link) and seeing the various 'inclosures'. Inclosures are defined as 'clearly demarcated areas of predominantly plantation woodland which may or may not be separated from the grazed Open Forest by stock fences' (New Forest Design Plan). As a result, this walk will be primarily wooded, but there will be some open grazed land and village clearings for variety.\nOn the subject of variety, the walk crosses the Bolderwood Arboretum Ornamental Drive twice, along which, in 1860, were planted ornamental coniferous trees. Some were lost in the storm of 1987 but look out for Douglas fir, deodar cedar, Lawson’s cyprus, western red cedar, giant redwood and black pine. Staying with the subject of trees, this walk will also encounter the Forest's oldest one, the 600 year old Knightwood Oak.\nClose to the end of the walk is another pretty village, Emery Down. This was where, in 1840, the famous 'snake catcher' Brusher Mills was born. A benefactor of the village was Admiral Frederick Moore Boultbee, who lived there between 1856 and 1876. He paid for the village church, school and almshouses which were all designed by the eminent architect William Butterfield. The New Forest Inn hosted the captain of the Titanic, Edward Smith, on his final night on British shores before the fateful sailing.\nThe New Forest is of exceptional importance for wildlife, but after this walk, 'Mike's Minstead Mince', this part of it should be of exceptional importance to us OutdoorLads for its historical and literary connections too.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask that you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times (see\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control\n). If your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like. If this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\n(Photo credits: View south-west from the north end of Acres Down, New Forest: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Clearing near Puckpits Inclosure: Photo ©\nHugh Venables\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Blackensford, woodland: Photo ©\nMike Faherty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Black Water, Dames Slough Inclosure: Photo ©\nTim Heaton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A track in the Knightwood Inclosure: Photo ©\nGillian Thomas\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Forest track, Knightwood Inclosure, New Forest, Hampshire: Photo ©\nClive Perrin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Knightwood Oak: Photo ©\nStuart Buchan\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n) (rotated to be 'landscape'); Boultbee Cottage at Emery Down: Photo ©\nDave Jacobs\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pond at Acre's Down: Photo ©\nBob Ford\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Grave of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, All Saints Church, Minstead: Photo ©\nMaigheach-gheal\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). Pub sign The Trusty Servant, Minstead: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). All photos are copyrighted but are above credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for further reuse under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (\nCC BY-SA 2.0\n).)",

That's well catered for as well, with an extensive modern bouldering area ensuring there is plenty to keep you busy, or you can swap between climbing and bouldering on the same night.\nClimbing is the main focus of the event, but this is also a great chance to meet other members and build lasting friendships. Many Outdoor Lads members join through climbing, so if you're new to the group and want to know more, come along and chat over a cuppa during the tea and cake break.\nWhat to expect on your first climb with us?\nIf you are an experienced climber and have passed the centre's proficiency test, we'll pair you up with a climbing buddy and you'll be out exploring the centre in no time.\nIf you have never climbed before or think you could do with a refresher, we offer supervised climbing sessions with one of our leaders, subject to availability. That session will focus on introducing you to climbing, making sure you get plenty of time on the wall whilst also showing you how to belay safely. Due to the centre's rules, we are limited in the number of climbers the leader is able to supervise in each session so if you think you may need a supervised session,\nplease contact the leader before signing up to make sure there is enough space.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nAfter a few supervised sessions, you should be ready to complete the centre's proficiency test and once that has been passed, you'll be able to climb with the rest of the group.\nEverything else you need to know\nYou will need to register with Big Depot before your first visit to the centre but you only need to do this once. If you are an experienced climber, you can save time and do this online\nhere\n, selecting the 18+ unsupervised option. This also applies if you just want to boulder, just select the relevant options during the registration. If you are a beginner and require a supervised session, the leader will help register you when you are at the centre.\nPhotos provided by Sieh and Dexmonster.",

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at Nottingham’s newest bouldering venue\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nPhotos:\nAll images supplied by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

    "Summary": "This is a 19km (12 mile) walk taking in Leigh Woods, Paradise Bottom, Ham Green, Abbots Pool and the Ashton Court Estate. Situated just outside of Bristol in North Somerset, this walk contains a mixture of woodland and the open grassland of Ashton Court.\nToday's walk starts and finishes in the the grounds of Leigh Woods.   The older sections of these woods were originally designed by Humphrey Repton, and restored by the Forestry Commission after World War II, when much of it was felled for the war effort.  Despite this, there are still some areas that retain the original woodland, such as the Giant Redwood, Weymouth Pine, Sweet Chestnut and Fulham Oak that can all be found within Paradise Bottom ancient arboretum.\nWe then move on to the landscaped gardens and parkland of the Ashton Court Estate.  Whilst nothing can be seen of the original fortified 11th century manor, Ashton Court has been substantially re-modelled through its history, and is a mix of many different architectural styles, including gothic, Tudor, Victorian and Jacobean influences.  There is also a large Deer Park to the north of the mansion house, where you may well be able to see the herd of Deer.\nAs we leave Ashton Court we head north towards Abbots Pool.  Surrounded by Oak, Beech and Sycamore trees, Abbot's Pool was originally used in the middle ages by the monks from St Augustine Abbey in Bristol, to provide fresh fish. The landscaping of this popular beauty spot was completed by the Wills family in the 1920's.\nFrom here we head out across the fields of Lower Failand towards Ham Green and then follow the River Avon Trail back until we reach the 18th Century Arboretum of Paradise Bottom and from here head back up to our start point in Leigh Woods car park.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check out the South Wales and South West Calendar\nhere\n.\nPhoto Credits\n: Event photos taken by the event leader and permission is granted to Outdoor Lads for further use.",

    "Summary": "Easy 8 mile circular walk Sutton Park is one of the largest urban parks in the United Kingdom. The park covers more than 2,400 acres. It consists of a mix of heathland, wetlands and marshes, seven lakes, extensive ancient woodlands (covering approximately a quarter of the park), a private 18-hole golf course on its western edge and a municipal golf course to the south, a donkey sanctuary, children's playgrounds and a visitors' centre.\nThe park was established as a Royal Forest by the Anglo Saxon kings of Mercia, from their seat at Tamworth at around the 9th century. By the early 12th century, it was in use as a Norman medieval deer park. The land was given to the people of Sutton Coldfield by King Henry VIII in 1528 after Bishop John Vesey, a friend of the King, asked for it as a present to the people of Sutton Coldfield. The charcoal burning that took place in the park is thought to have given Sutton Coldfield the second part of its name.\nJoin me for a stroll through this park on marked footpaths for approx. 8 miles. There will be opportunity for a coffee or pint afterwards.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nor\nODL West Midlands\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\nAll pictures taken by the ODL leaders and permission is granted to ODL for their use.",

    "Summary": "Leaders  - this weekend is just for you!\nFollowing the success of the leaders' meet ups in 2025, they are back for 2026. This is a weekend for leaders, heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads.\nIt's a chance to celebrate the organisation, our positive impact on our community and how volunteers make it happen. A chance to connect and network with other leaders, share ideas and tips, inspiration, motivation and review our 2025 plans and plans for 2026. There will be some help and guidance on offer to help upskill our leaders, and it's also a thank you from OutdoorLads to you for all you put into the organisation, without which - there would be no OutdoorLads! But don't worry - this IS NOT a weekend sat inside with post-it notes and flipcharts. The emphasis will be very much on getting outside, partaking in activities and getting to know each other!\nWe'll be staying in a YHA venue with dormitory accommodation and good social spaces. Located in Berkshire and a 5 min walk to the River Thames, the site has easy access to lots of opportunities for walking and cycling in particular. There will very likely be chance to visit a local public house over the weekend, as part of a social evening on Saturday night. As leaders, you may well be approached to run an event over the weekend for others to join in with - you have been warned! ;-)\nWe plan to make full use of the weekend, so please plan to depart from 12 noon onwards on the Sunday. For those who wish, there will be an optional Sunday lunch trip (you will need to pay for that yourself.)\nAlthough primarily aimed at leaders in the South East and South West / South Wales regions, this is open to any  of our leaders. A similar event aimed primarily at the\nCentral, North-East and Yorkshire, and North West / North Wales\nregions is taking place in the Peak District.\nTo note:\nThis event is heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads, and all food is provided over the weekend. However, travel expenses are not provided for this event. If that cost is a struggle for you, we don't want that to be a reason for you not to join us - please apply to the\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nfor help with that cost.\nAlthough the standard refund policy applies to this event, if you need to cancel, please do so as early as possible, so we can ensure the event is as full as possible with leaders who can benefit from the weekend.\nIf you are not yet a leader you will need to have applied and be well on with your leader application to join this event. If you're not sure if you should book or not, drop the office a line on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nand we'll chat it through with you. We will remove any bookings from members who are not leaders and haven't got an active leader application in.\nPhotos:\nFrom OutdoorLads Members and used with permission.  YHA Streatley & River Thames pictures from YHA website\nDogs:\nthis event is not suitable for dogs.",

Then on to\nMoel Lefn\n(638m), with some boulders to clamber over.

Please come prepared with an appetite for a big day out.

These beautiful glacial valleys drop down steeply from both sides of the ridge, so we'll make sure to take our time during this section of the walk.\nYr Wyddfa's Summit:\nSnowdon, or Yr Wyddfa, is Wales's highest peak, reaching 1085m. While the summit will no doubt be busy with fellow hikers; should the weather be clear, we'll have stunning views over the National Park and beyond. As there is a café on the summit, we'll stay here for our lunch break, before descending via the Snowdon Ranger Path.\nThe Welsh Highland Railway:\nAs we cut off the Ranger path to head back to Rhyd Ddu, we'll cross the tracks of the Welsh Highland Railway. This heritage line runs regularly from Porthmadog to Caernarfon, and if we're lucky, we'll see it as we cross.\nOther Infomation:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "This hike is about 15km (9.5 miles) with ~1000m (3280ft) of ascent. The South Ridge involves simple scrambling over rocky terrain, with mild exposure (big drops), so you'll need a head for heights. The rest of the walk follows established mountain paths.",

From Davidson's Mains we head south for Corstorphine Hill - a Local Nature Reserve in the city - a wonderful space for nature where the noise of the city rapidly disappears, plus there's a few views out across the suburbs.\nAfter Corstorphine Hill we drop down to find the Corstorphine branch, this was part of the North British Railway network and was a short branch off the main line. It's now even shorter as the Corstorphine station site is now a street of houses, but we walk along to find Pinkhill station still in place albeit without its tracks.\nThe last section of the walk is round the back of Murrayfield stadium through Roseburn Park - depending on the size of group we could pop into the Rose Bean cafe for a cuppa, or head back to Haymarket for a coffee there.\nPhotos:\ntaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

Category Zero is the rating of the vessel, meaning she can sail anywhere in the world in all conditions.

Absolute beginner with no sailing experience, or total sailing pro? It doesn't matter if you've never set foot on a boat before or if you're a qualified sailor, these trips are for everyone. You'll learn what you need to know to sail the ship.\nThis is not a leisure holiday! Voyages aboard CatZero are interactive, fun and rewarding. You'll be living in very close proximity with the rest of team, and working together throughout the five days. Whilst sailing (approximately 24 hours each way) we will split into two watches, alternating every four hours to rest/work, including through the night. You'll take your role in helping run the boat, from cooking, cleaning, scrubbing the decks and helping sail throughout your trip. Team work and camaraderie will be in abundance, and we're sure you'll have an absolutely fantastic time on board. You'll be exhausted by the end of the week, but you will have had the absolute time of your lives, learn a lot about sailing, yourself, and each other - this is the kind of trip that creates special memories.\nPast sailing experience is not necessary - there will be an experienced crew on board who will show you everything you need to do. If you've never sailed before but think you'd enjoy it, and are prepared to get stuck in and give it your all for a five days, then this is a perfect event for you! Included as part of this trip, you can even complete the\nRYA Competent Crew qualification\n!\nOn arrival into Zeebrugge on the Saturday morning, we'll put the sails away and then be able to have a shower, refresh ourselves, and have a restful explore of the city, or just plonk ourselves somewhere for some refreshments in the July sunshine. Depending on timing, passport control, and transport available, we may be able to venture into the centre of Bruges. You are also free to do your own thing.\nIf you have any questions before you book please feel free to contact the event Leader.\nHighlight reel from our 2025 sail to The Netherlands >\nHere's an article\nabout one of CatZero's recent Dutch Dashes, where you can also learn about the remarkable charity, bringing about positive change in peoples' lives.\nJoin us for a tour of CatZero on Sunday 1st March 2026, 10:30am >\n(to coincide with the\nHull social\nthe night before)\nCan't make the tour, but want another opportunity to check out CatZero?\nLet us know\nand we'll see what we can do!\nPayment\nWe're pleased to be able to bring this event to you £39 cheaper than last year!\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nIf you have not been to one of the London Climbing Centres you will need to pre-register\nHERE\n. You only need to register once to use any of their 8 centres in London.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nFirst time boulderer?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before, the event leader can give you a short introduction to get you started and give a few a few pointers on technique. After which we will join in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nExperienced boulderer?\nSimply register with the wall and turn up on the day!\nAs above, all attending the event must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible for your own safety and so should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads volunteers or other experienced climbers.",

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful. All levels are welcome!\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome\n. If you're new to climbing, we've got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall. Don’t worry about needing to invest in gear before you try. The Climbing Hangar offers\nfree shoe rentals\nso you don’t have to shell out for shoes until you know bouldering is for you.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity. I keep our group tight-knit to foster connection and ensure personalised coaching for everyone, regardless of your experience level. Many climbers started their journeys relatively “late” in life, incl. some session leaders\n🤫\nWe convene at the\nClimbing Hangar in Reading\n, one of the largest climbing centres in the region. The generously spacious and friendly cafe/lounge is my personal favourite where you can find us socialising, having a cuppa, snacks or even pizza before and after the climbs.\nIf you have never climbed at the Climbing Hangar in Reading before, you must book an induction slot:\nhttps://www.theclimbinghangar.com/locations/reading\n- follow instructions to book an induction slot around the time that this event starts.\nYou also need to\ncomplete the waiver form that is linked in the confirmation email\nonce you've booked an induction slot.\nThis only needs to be done once.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "OutdoorLads is\nspending the weekend at a YHA near Glastonbury.\nIf you want to join us just for the day, we'll be spending Saturday exploring the town, popping into\nWhite Springs Sanctuary\n, and walking up to the Tor.\nFamed for its abundance of legends and mythology, Glastonbury is a place of spiritual significance for many cultures, including Druids and Pagans who believe the landscape possesses unique spiritual magnetism. Embracing diversity is part of the Glastonbury way, making it a welcoming destination for all.\nOften referred to as the Isle of Avalon, Glastonbury stands prominently in the centre of the Somerset Levels, characterised by its notable hills. The iconic Glastonbury Tor, dedicated to the Archangel Michael, and Chalice Hill, rumored to be the resting place of the Holy Grail, are key highlights. Legend also has it that the Glastonbury Holy Thorn grew from the staff planted by Jesus's uncle, Joseph of Arimathea.\nWe'll aim for lunch in Glastonbury itself, so there should be options for sandwiches there.\nPlaces for this walk are limited as you'll be joining the already fully booked up YHA weekend.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nThis walk will be a fairly 'urban' route - through both Street and Glastonbury with a lot of road walking.\nDogs are absolutely not allowed inside the YHA\n(where we'll be gathering at the start and end of the walk).\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "'Lads who regularly endure my walks will know that I have two nerdy fixations: ancient churches and classic sci-fi. There will be one ancient church, but the rest are Victorian and missable. The classic sci-fi reference is the Fourth Doctor being chased across the Scottish moors by the Loch Ness Monster, which was filmed on commonland we'll cross. Sandy trails and tarmac lanes will speed our progress through pine forests, over heathland and across aristocratic parkland (golf course, estate farms, polo grounds and pony paddocks). The centrepiece will be a lunch at The Three Moles in Selham, a pub as renowned for its beer and food as much as it is for not admitting children.\nThe sights:\nMidhurst:\nTo quote my go-to topographer Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n: 'To the main road traveller, Midhurst, like Petworth, is a bewildering series of acute ninety-degree bends combined with an inexplicable cottagey cosiness in the buildings, so different from the open market-places of Hampshire. Few towns are more deceptive, few towns withhold themselves so firmly until the traveller gets out of his car and on to his feet: few towns in particular have a more exciting relationship with the surrounding countryside'. The parish church (St Mary Magdalene and St Denys) is disappointing: some parts are C13, but most seems to be from the restoration of 1882. It overlooks a pleasant if rather empty square. The Spread Eagle Hotel is 1700, the Old Market House is C16, Market Hall (Now Eagle House) is 1552 with an C18 front. The former library is a ramble of tiled and timbered cottages of the C17. The biggest building is Cowdray House, just NE of the town, the epitome of sober but splendid Tudor architecture, dating from 1492 to 1542. It was left a ruin by a fire in 1793 and so spared from being Victorianised. The octagonal building is a water tower, well disguised.\nEasebourne:\nA Cowdray Estate village (identified by yellow paintwork), mostly sandstone with some timber framing. St Mary is a priory church from the C13, but almost everything is now of 1876. Easebourne Priory was founded in 1238 and what is left are the buildings around the cloister which now form an amalgam of medieval, C17 and C18 design. On the vast Cowdray Estate are a number of superb trees. The Queen Elizabeth Oak is a large sessile oak tree (Quercus petraea) with a girth of about 12.5 metres and an age of 800–1,000 years. In 2002, The Tree Council named it one of fifty Great British Trees for its national heritage value. Legend says that in 1591 Queen Elizabeth I hid beneath it to shoot a stag nearby.\nLodsworth:\n'In some of the loveliest and best-kept countryside in England...One long narrow village street running down to a T-junction.' St Peter's Church has 'a magnificent situation, looking east across a wooded valley'. (Ian Nairn). The church is over-restored Victorian, but the tower in C13. Pretty cottages and fine houses all around, Including Great House and Dower House (C18), Manor House (C13). The Winnie-the-Pooh illustrator EH Shephard lived in the village until his death in 1976.\nSelham:\n'In lovely rich scenery, an intimate mixture of meadow and heathland. No centre, just scattered houses, stone, brick and tile-hanging.' St James' Church is a lovely simple two-cell Saxon-Norman building, C11, with a composite Norman chancel arch.\nThe Three Moles\npub in which we'll have lunch is renowned for his food, ale, location, service and the fact that it doesn't permit under-12s. (I am grateful to the lovely Will Thornton for putting me on to the place and inspiring the walk.)\nAmbersham Common:\nOne of a number of sandy heaths south of the River Rother. It was here in 1975 (with Sussex standing in for Scotland) that Tom Baker's Doctor was filmed being chased by the Skarasen, aka the Loch Ness Monster, a creature upon which the villainous and be-suckered Zygons depended for their supply of lactic fluid and for their plans of world domination. The\neffects\nweren't wholly a disaster.\nWest Lavington:\nJust a Victorian church and some large houses, now almost a pleasant suburb of Midhurst. The church is by noted architect William Butterfield, 1850, who followed the Tractarian Movement which sought to restore ritual and mystery to the Anglican Church. The Rectory is also probably by him.\nThe\nroute\n(please click on the link in red to be taken to the Ordnance Survey website):\nWe'll take the causeway to Cowdray, then follow the New Lipchis Way to Lodsworth. We'll then follow a bridleway and Selham Road off the A272 to lunch. Then we'll take a Selham Road west before taking Smokyhouse Lane south to Ambersham Common where we'll follow the Serpent Trail to West Lavington. At Chichester Road in MIdhurst we'll walk through the town centre along Church Hill to North Street to go back to the start.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, except that there will be a number of stiles to cross (you may have to lift your muddy beast over them), lanes to walk along, a few fields with livestock and the town of Midhurst. Any dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Picture credits: Cowdray Park:\nPhoto\n©\nMaigheach-gheal\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n), Bridleway to Vining Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);  Queen Elizabeth oak, Cowdray Park, near Lodsworth:\nPhoto\n©\npam fray\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Benbow Pond:\nPhoto\n©\nShazz\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Elegant house in 'The Street', Lodsworth:\nPhoto\n©\nRoger Cornfoot\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Salmonsbridge Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); St James Church, Selham:\nPhoto\n©\nMaigheach-gheal\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Footpath across Graffham Common:\nPhoto\n©\nPeter Holmes\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n; Ambersham Common (4):\nPhoto\n©\nStephen Richards\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Town Hall, Midhurst by\nRoger Cornfoot\n; Capron House by\nOliver Dixon\n; Eagle House, Market Square, Midhurst by\nStefan Czapski\n; Harveys Bottle and Jug, Elizabeth House, Church Hill, Midhurst by\nJo Turner\n; Cowdray Castle by\nRoger Cornfoot\n; Ruins of Cowdray Castle Midhurst by\nChris Gunns\n; Easebourne Priory by\nBen Gamble\n. All photos are copyrighted but are above credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for further reuse under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (\nCC BY-SA 2.0\n).)",

Whilst we will walk from Filey to Scarborough,\nwe will start at Scarborough train station\nand catch the 11:00 train to Filey and then walk back to Scarborough. Please ensure you purchase a train ticket (about £3.60 - 15 min)\nBeginning in Filey town centre on Centenary Way and finishing at Scarborough train station. It’s a straightforward coastal route, though it is 10.5miles (17K), so we will go at a reasonable pace. Depending on the weather, we may include a walk out along Filey Brigg, a rocky promontory. From there, the route leads along the clifftop path north.\nAlong the way, the walk passes a series of notable points, including Newbiggin Cliff, North Cliff, and the wide sweep of Cayton Bay. The final stretch into Scarborough brings a shift from open coastline to a more urban feel, passing landmarks such as the historic Spa Cliff Lift and the Grand Hotel before ending in the town centre. It’s a route that blends coastal scenery, wildlife, and a few unexpected features, making it a varied and rewarding point‑to‑point walk.\nThere is plenty of parking around Scarborough if you arrive by car, though most of this requires payment. There will be the option of a cuppa or even fish and chips when we arrive back in Scarborough.\nPhoto Credits: Gordon Hatton, Pauline E and Stephen Craven - Geograph",

On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times.

As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nPhotos:\nAll images supplied by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced (independent) climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners (supervised) event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!  Beginner (supervised) events are offered every two weeks only; this enables the event leader to climb too.\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Birmingham Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb, you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Introduction:\nLast year it was an 'All-New Dorset Double' based in Lyme Regis, but this year it's back to the classic one based in Purbeck. As usual, there are two walks over a bank holiday weekend, and you can do either or both, but you have to organise your own accommodation. Campsites, hotels and B&Bs are plentiful, although they will be booking up fast. The 'Double' walks normally take place in the second May Bank Holiday weekend, but I will be away then, and by doing it on the first weekend you can go to Big Spring Camp on the second. Despite the weather being slightly cooler at the start of May, I hope you can come and experience the best of the Jurassic Coast Unesco World Heritage Site - some of the finest coastal scenery in the country (nay the world) - and just two hours from London.\nSchedule:\nDay 1 (Saturday 2 May): Corfe Castle to Kimmeridge, Kimmeridge Ledges, Chapman's Pool and Kingston - circular walk (or linear with bus back)\nDay 2 (Sunday 3 May): Corfe Castle to Kingston, St Aldhelm's Head, Winspit, Dancing Ledge and Swanage - linear walk with bus back\nDay 2: Corfe Castle to St Aldhelm's Head, Winspit, Dancing Ledge and Swanage\nOur survey of the spectacular scenery of the Jurassic Coast continues with a linear walk where the gentle heaths of Corfe Common give way to the immense limestone cliffs of Purbeck, culminating in the breathtaking prominence of St Aldhelm's Head. It also takes in the scarred and eerie landscape of Winspit Quarries, the remarkable quasi-natural stage of Dancing Ledge and the Victorian earnestness of Durlston Country Park. After a journey through geological deep time, industrial recent time, and science-fictional space-time, we'll end up in Swanage, where cafés, ice cream parlours and amusement arcades will evoke family holidays before the bus gets you quickly back to Corfe Castle.\nThe sights:\nCorfe Castle:\nBuilt by William the Conqueror and one of the first castles to be built with stone. Updated in the C12 and C13. Sold by Elizabeth I in 1572 to Sir Christopher Hatton, and then in 1635 to Sir John Bankes whose wife, Lady Mary Bankes, led the defence of the castle when it was twice besieged by Parliamentarian forces. The first siege, in 1643, was unsuccessful, but the second, in 1645, succeeded. In March that year the castle was slighted on Parliament's orders. A Grade I-listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument.\nKingston:\nSet on high ground with wide views toward Corfe Castle and Poole Harbour. The name is from 'king’s farm', reflecting Saxon royal ownership before later monastic control. The colossal Church of St James, built in 1873 by noted architect George Edmund Street, dominates the village. It was funded by Lord Eldon as a private chapel and became the parish church in 1922 when the former parish church (now a private residence) became too dilapidated.\nSt Aldhelm’s Head:\nA dramatic limestone headland famous for sheer coastal cliffs, seabirds, and St Aldhelm’s Chapel, a square stone vaulted building from the C12, thought to have served as a beacon or place of pilgrimage, with sweeping sea views.\nWinspit Quarries:\nAn abandoned limestone quarry complex, worked from the early C18 to the late C20. The quarries are cut directly into the cliffs, with galleries and tunnels opening onto the sea. Winspit is also culturally notable as a filming location for classic science fiction, including\nDoctor Who\n(as Skaro in 'Destiny of the Daleks' from 1979),\nBlake’s 7\n(as Mecron 2 in 'Games' from 1981) and more recently the series\nStar Wars: Andor\n, giving it an enduring cult reputation.\nDancing Ledge:\nA broad wave-cut platform at the foot of the cliffs near Langton Matravers, created by a combination of natural erosion and quarrying. Quarrymen once loaded stone directly onto boats from the ledge, and cut pools remain as evidence. The name may refer to the movement of waves across the flat rock.\nTilly Whim Caves:\nA group of former limestone quarries cut into the cliffs at Durlston, worked mainly in the C18 and C19. The caves supplied building stone for local use and were later opened as a Victorian tourist attraction. Quarrying ceased and the caves were closed in the 1970s due to rockfall risk. Although inaccessible, they remain an important wildlife site, supporting bats and seabirds, and illustrate the industrial exploitation of Purbeck geology. Anvil Point Lighthouse is from 1881 and is fully automatic.\nDurlston Head:\nA prominent limestone headland south of Swanage. The cliffs expose a sequence of Purbeck and Portland limestones that record changing environments from lagoons to shallow seas. The area bears clear evidence of historic quarrying, alongside later maritime and industrial features such as coastal defences and navigation aids. Now managed as Durlston Country Park, the headland is valued for its geology, biodiversity and panoramic coastal views. A notable landmark is the Great Globe, built in 1887 by George Burt: a massive stone sphere over 3 metres in diameter, carved with a detailed map of the world and astonishingly accurate astronomical data, and mounted on a Purbeck stone plinth, celebrating Victorian science and craftsmanship.\nSwanage:\nA coastal town on the eastern edge of the Isle of Purbeck, nestled between bays of limestone and chalk. Its development was shaped by nearby stone quarries and later by Victorian tourism, transforming it into a seaside resort. The town retains strong maritime and cultural traditions, centred on its pier, heritage railway and annual festivals. Swanage also serves as a gateway to the Jurassic Coast, with close connections to fossil hunting, coastal walking and the wider geological heritage of Purbeck.\nThe\nroute\n(please click here to check the route on the Ordnance Survey website and see elevations and ascents)\n:\nHeading south out of Corfe Castle, along West Street, we'll reach Corfe Common and use the Hardy Way to get to Kingston. We'll walk along South Street and reach the Purbeck Way which will link up with the South West Coast Path, which will take us all the way to Swanage.\nAccommodation:\nCampsites: Choose one near Corfe Castle. Browse\nhere\n.\nWoodyhyde\nis always popular with ODLers doing the Dorset Double, and you'll have lots of company.

Browse\nhere\n(click the link).\nBook from Friday 1 May to Monday 4 May if planning on doing both walks and staying down.\nThe OutdoorLads Foundation:\nIf the cost of travelling and staying over is daunting, do consider using the OutdoorLads Foundation. This enables paying members to receive up to £200 in total a year towards any expense they incur participating in an OutdoorLads event. Just apply simply and confidentially\nhere\n, at least two weeks before the event.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Much of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, although they will be able to go in the sea at Dancing Ledge. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\n(Images: Durlston Bay:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Andrews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);View North from the Cliffs at St Aldhelm's Head:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Champion\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); West Street, Corfe Castle: Photo ©\nPierre Terre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). View from Emmetts Hill to the coastguard cottages on St Aldhelm's Head, Isle of Purbeck:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Champion\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Cliff east of St. Aldhelm's Head:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Worth Matravers: The disused Winspit Quarry and derelict buildings from above:\nPhoto\n©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Winspit Quarry caves:\nPhoto\n©\nIan Andrews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Dancing Ledge:\nPhoto\n©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Durlston, lighthouse:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Faherty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Swanage, Durlston Head: The Great Globe:\nPhoto\n©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Swanage Pier (2):\nPhoto\n©\nBarry Shimmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

It'll be a bit longer than Sunday's walk, but you could make it more manageable by getting the bus back to Corfe Castle from Kingston (no matter if we've just missed it; we'll have a drink at The Scott Arms while waiting). Among the highlights of the route will be the Kimmeridge Ledges, which are banks of rock sticking out into the sea, and Chapman's Pool, an idyllic oval of turquoise water, framed by vividly verdant cliffs.\nThe sights:\nCorfe Castle:\nBuilt by William the Conqueror and one of the first castles to be built with stone. Updated in the C12 and C13.

The first siege, in 1643, was unsuccessful, but the second, in 1645, succeeded. In March that year the castle was slighted on Parliament's orders. A Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument.\nKimmeridge:\nAn attractive village of limestone cottages. Within Kimmeridge parish there are twenty-five listed buildings. The parish church was mostly rebuilt in 1872, though it has C12th origins; the south door and parts of the west wall of the nave are still original. The south porch is early C13.\nThe Etches Collection\n(The Museum of Jurassic Marine Life) is an independent fossil museum, based on the collection of Steve Etches, a plumber and fossil hunter after whom some of his finds were named. The collection contains plesiosaur (including the 'Sea Rex' that Sir David Attenborough helped excavate in 2022) and ichthyosaur fossils as well as ammonites and other molluscs. The museum opened in 2016 and costs £9.50 to enter. If that's not your thing, you could have a drink at Clavell's restaurant in the village.\nKimmeridge Bay:\nThe bay is roughly semicircular and backed by low cliffs of Kimmeridge clay, and beneath the cliffs is a large wave-cut platform and a rocky shore. Within the clay are bands of bituminous shale, which in the history of the village have been the focus of several attempts to create an industrial centre. An oil well with nodding donkey has operated since 1959 and was producing 100,000 gallons a week in its early years. The village is globally recognised as the archetype of the Kimmeridgian Stage of the Late Jurassic Period.\nClavell Tower:\nA folly high on the cliff eastwards of Kimmeridge Bay, built in 1830 in a Tuscan style. It inspired PD James's novel\nThe Black Tower\nand was used in the 1985 ITV adaptation starring Roy Marsden.\nAt risk from falling into the sea, it was recently dismantled and then reassembled 35 m further back from the cliff edge. It is available as a holiday let.\nKimmeridge Ledges:\nA set of Kimmeridge clay wave-cut platforms, their geology a highly important part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Famous for the quality of the fossils they yield as they reveal an entire Late Jurassic marine ecosystem with sea reptiles, bivalves and ammonites, with many finds held in The Etches Collection.\nChapman's Pool:\nA beautiful semicircular cove between two headlands. The rocks that form the cove are the upper parts of the Kimmeridge Clay, and are rich in fossils of bivalves and ammonites.\nThe\nroute\n(please click here to check the route on the Ordnance Survey website and see elevations and ascents)\n:\nWe'll pass Corfe Castle and walk along West Hill, Knowle Hill and Ridgeway Hill before dropping down to footpaths across fields to Kimmeridge. After a break in Kimmeridge village we'll use footpaths heading southwest to get to Kimmeridge Bay. We'll then be on the South West Coast Path, which we'll follow all the way along the coast to Chapman's Pool. At Chapman's Pool we'll use a footpath heading north to Kingston, where you can get the bus back or walk the full route using the Hardy Way to go back to Corfe Castle.\nAccommodation:\nCampsites: Choose one near Corfe Castle.

    "Summary": "Join Alex for this 10.5-mile circular walk along one of Britain's oldest roads via one of its oldest doors.\nOur route starts at All Saints' church in the pleasant North Essex village of Great Chesterford, a short walk from the railway station. We will head northeast through the centre of the village and then follow country lanes between undulating farmland and woodland for the next couple of miles, before veering more sharply uphill and into open fields.\nFrom here we will enjoy fine views of nearby Rivey Hill, topped with an imposing water tower, and the large village of Linton nestling in the valley of the Granta, one of two tributaries of the River Cam to bear that name. We will head towards Linton, crossing into Cambridgeshire, and then descend into the village along its attractive High Street. Here we will enter the grounds of St Mary's church where we will stop for lunch.\nLeaving Linton, we will head past an old mill and begin our ascent to the small Essex village of Hadstock. We will head past a number of timbered and thatched houses, cross the village green, and leave via the 11th-century church of St Botolph, believed to have the country's oldest working door. Here we will join the main route of the Icknield Way, an ancient road believed to be Britain's oldest.\nThe final section of the walk along the Icknield Way follows the ridge of the low hills and offers wide-ranging views westwards into the broad valley of the Cam. Here Great Chesterford will come into view as we begin our descent. On arrival back in the village there will be an option to go the Crown and Thistle pub before heading back to cars or the station.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nNew members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nThe walk is suitable for dogs but please bear in mind not everyone likes dogs as much as you.

    "Summary": "http://www.burghisland.com/\nThere was something magical about an island—the mere word suggested fantasy. You lost touch with the world—an island was a world of its own. A world, perhaps, from which you might never return.\nBurgh Island was a favourite spot for Agatha Christie.  It was the inspiration for Soldier Island for her novel 'And then there were None' and the hotel that Hercule Poirot stayed at in 'Evil under the Sun'.\nIf this had been an old house, with creaking wood, and dark shadows, and heavily paneled walls, there might have been an eerie feeling. But this house was the essence of modernity. There were no dark corners—no possible sliding panels—it was flooded with electric light—everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hidden in this house, nothing concealed.\nThis walk starts on the mainland in nearby Ringmore before walking along the river estuary of the Avon.  Depending on the tide we may be able to walk across to the Island for lunch, or there is a 'bus' you can catch over but we'll have lunch on the beach, get to spend an hour or so exploring, before heading back to the mainland past Bigbury-on-Sea before following the coastal path towards Ringmore again.\nThe walk is around 12 miles, and will take about 4 or 5 hours depending on how long we spend on Burgh Island and the beaches.\nThe tide times for the 27th June will mean that the causeway to Burgh Island will start to become impassable from around 1.45pm.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.",

    "Summary": "A fantabulosa troll round town to vada the latties, boozers and boards where birthday boy Kenneth Williams minced, mused and moued (that's your actual French). Putting our best plates forward, we'll go round the Old Smoke to clock the pads he called home, and the places where he lapped up the dolly trade and the odd bevvy. You'll have to nish the chat while I do the palari at each place, so keep your minces peeled as we charper how the Smoke shaped him being bona ajax on the surface, but in a right two-and-eight deep down. So let's zhoosh up our riahs, put on some comfy bats, and stretch our lallies, because this mince will be fabulosa, and dead bona for a gaggle of fortuni omis like us.\nThe vadas and\ntroll\n(please click the link at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\n1. Russell Square Station:\nDespite being born in King's Cross (on 22 February 1926 in Bingfield Street - now demolished), Bloomsbury was the spiritual home of Kenneth Williams. 'They needn’t talk to me about loneliness. I’ve walked too many miles of pavement…' (\nThe Kenneth Williams Diaries,\n21 April 1964)\n2. 57 Marchmont Street, Bloomsbury:\nChildhood home from 1935-1956. Mid-19th century terrace. “I never felt completely happy here, yet it shaped every odd, twisted impulse I have.” (\nTKWD,\n21 Apr 1964). His father ran a barber's shop on the ground floor. 'I remember once a man came into the shop and said \"I'd like a blow wave, please\" to which my father replied \"you'll get no blow wave 'ere. What are you? An iron? Iron hoof? Not 'avin' any irons in my shop. Go on, get out!\" (\nKenneth Williams, Comic Roots\n, 1983)\n3. 14 Cromer House, Cromer Street, St Pancras:\nLate Victorian block, 1880s. Grew up here with parents and sister (1928-1935). \"When I was very young I used to throw flower pots [from the balconies] on the heads of unsuspecting passersby, and one of them was Florrie Plume who happened to be a great friend of my mother's. She said afterwards “it was the only by wearing a thick felt 'at at the time that saved me from a terrible injury from your boy”. My missile throwing was not the result of wickedness; it was simply because I suffered from insomnia and frankly I still do.' (\nKenneth Williams: Going Places\n, 1975)\n4. The Boot Pub, Cromer Street:\nLate Georgian pub, 1820s. Early comic training ground doing comic songs and routines and listening to the stories and accents of patrons. 'I found that if I got up on the stage to entertain the troops I could make them shut up and look.' (Quote c. 1960s).\n5. Argyle Primary School, Tonbridge Street:\nVictorian school, 1870s. Early education and first stage notice. “As a scholar my results were lamentable except for English because I liked the English master. He would take us reading poetry every day - Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning - and he directed me in the school play...it was called the Rose and the Ring, and they gave me a big part as the Princess Angelica. I stomped around the stage waving my feather duster and saying \"get out of my way!\". I had no idea how aristocrats behaved, but I think I did it instinctively. I got a very good notice in the local paper which pleased me immensely. It was my first taste of performing. It read: \"Kenneth Williams, with his mincing step and comical demeanour as the Princess Angelia was a firm favourite for the audience to whom his pert vivacity made great appeal.\"' (\nKenneth Williams, Comic Roots\n, 1983)\n6. Endsleigh Court:\nA mid-20th century Bloomsbury mansion block. His first independent home (1956–59).\n7. Marlborough House, Osnaburgh Street:\n19th-century townhouse (demolished). Lived here from 1970 until his death on 14 April 1988. 'Providing there is no pain I shall be happy to go when the time comes; nothing here has really delighted me except Art.' (\nTKWD,\n22 January 1985)\n8. Regent’s Park – Outer Circle:\nJohn Nash, 1811–1820. 'I walked here often, alone with my thoughts. The roses seemed to judge me gently, not mock me.'  (\nTKWD\n, 20 March 1988)\n9. Farley Court, Baker Street\nEdwardian block, 1905. Lived here from 1963 to 1970. “I sometimes wonder where I learned all the rubbish ‘beliefs’ I used to hold… the only way to execute & convey your vision… is to do it yourself.' (\nTKWD\n). Nearby is Madame Tussaud's and the Planetarium (1958).\n10. BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place:\nArt Deco building by George Val Myer, 1932. It was here that some of his greatest radio successes -\nBeyond Our Ken\n,\nRound the Horne\n,\nJust a Minute\n- were recorded. 'They needn’t talk to me about loneliness. I’ve walked too many miles of pavement…' (\nTKWD,\n21 April 1964). Nearby is all Souls Church (John Nash, 1823) and the RIBA headquarters (George Grey Wornum, 1934).\n11. Garrick Theatre, Charing Cross Road:\nDesigned by W.G.R. Sprague, 1889. Location of revues, such as\nPieces of Eight\nand\nShare My Lettuce\n. 'Last performance of\nShare My Lettuce\n… a wonderful last night house.' (\nTKWD,\n17 May 1958)\n12. Stanfords, Long Acre (Site):\n19th-century building, rebuilt 1920s. Early draughtsman job as a mapmaker. 'The thing to do, in any circumstance, is to appear to know exactly what you are doing.' (\nTKWD,\nc1964)\n13. Russell Square:\n1804, Laid out by the Dukes of Bedford. 'Squares of learning and quiet; I envied the calmness of stone as I carried my restless mind past.' (\nTKWD\n)\n14.\nFinish at Russell Square Station.\n(Image credits: London Kings Cross Railway Station:\nPhoto\n©\nNigel Thompson\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Russell Square Station:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Sutton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); 38 - 43, Russell Square:\nPhoto\n©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bandstand - Regent's Park:\nPhoto\n©\nPaul Gillett\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); London - Baker Street:\nPhoto\n©\nLewis Clarke\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place:\nPhoto\n©\nRichard Cooke\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A walk from Clerkenwell to Piccadilly:\nPhoto\n©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nDon't forget to join us in the evening for the\nHull Social\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.",

    "Summary": "A Valentine's Day hike to get your heart racing!\nThis hike will start and finish in Arundel. There will be a good mix of scenery and views across the Sussex countryside. A few reasonable ups and downs and also pleasant flat ground await us as we enjoy some history and landmarks.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nRiver Arun\nOne of the fastest flowing rivers in England this river will accompany us for most of the hike. It is the longest river in Sussex and is tidal some 25 miles inland from Littlehampton. It's safe to assume that many of the villages and hamlets we pass through chose their location due to the river. Major improvements were made to the river as far back as 1540 when Arundel became a port.\nArun Valley Railway Line\nA much loved railway route offering great views of the Sussex countryside. As with the river the railway line will be with us for the hike. This route was one of the last in the area to be upgraded to modern colour light signalling, having previously been controlled by semaphore signals. The route also now uses axile counters to monitor the passage of trains. It sounds primitive but is meant to be fail safe. It works by train wheels being counted into a section of track and then counted out as it leaves. As long as they match then it's safe for the train behind to move forward.\nBurpham Church\nA church was recorded as being here in the Domesday book. The current tower dates to around the 15th century. We should hear the bells as they ring out every 15 minutes. There are records of bells being installed as early as 1488 when the vicar gave 12p towards purchasing them.\nNorth Stoke\nA medieval village first recorded in 1086. A sparce population meant that in 1931 the parish was merged with neighbouring Amberley. A few houses remain and a church that is maintained by volunteers.\nSouth Stoke\nThis village now falls under the Parish of Houghton but is part of the wider area of Offham. The Domesday book listed South Stoke as having 14 households and a church valued at £4. The population declined to medieval levels in 1806. This was due to common land being enclosed for Arundel Park. This in turn took away places for the local population to graze sheep and livestock.\nThe Black Rabbit\nOn our return leg we'll stop at this lovely pub for a break. It's a renowned location offering views of Arundel Castle, the river and the wetlands beyond. Inside the pub boasts authentic props from the Harry Potter movies.\nArundel Castle\nAlthough not part of this hike we will have views of the castle. It is a stunning restored medieval castle that is steeped in history. A couple of highlights include the castle being besieged by troops loyal to Henry I in 1101 and extensive damage being caused during the English Civil War.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can attend.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me if you have any questions.\nLooking For More:\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of other walks taking place in the South East.\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of provisional upcoming events in the ODL diary.\n(All photos taken by the leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "BIG20 events are our programme to celebrate our 20th birthday year\n- showcasing some of the best and most loved locations and venues we've been to in the last 20 years! Come along and on our return trip to one of OutdoorLads' favourite bunkhouses in a remote part of Northumberland for THREE nights, this will be a get away from it all weekend. This is a Friday to Monday trip!\nOur venue is located 4 miles from the nearest public road, deep into the Cheviots, along the College Valley. It lies less than 1/2 mile from the Scottish border, sandwiched between the border ridge and the Cheviot (815m).\nIt is surrounded by beautifully rounded Northumberland Hills, close to the northern end of the Pennine Way, with deep, wild valleys, and dramatic gullies created at the end of the last ice age.\nThis will be a remote, away-from-it-all weekend, where phone signals and wi-fi are unlikely, which is a magical chance to connect with OutdoorLads pals and the spectacular scenery that surrounds us. We'll spend two days getting out and exploring on foot - walks are necessarily going to involve some steep climbs and there are no \"gentle\" options - but you'll be rewarded for your efforts with spectacular views!\nThe evenings will be filled with hearty, home-cooked meals, and socialising with fellow OutdoorLads - board games and star gazing are likely to be high on the list of evening entertainment. It will be a fantastic weekend of comradery, great food, and genuinely getting out more!\nThe Hills\nThe\nCheviot Hills\nare a range of rolling hills straddling the Scottish Border with Northumberland. The English section is within the Northumberland National Park. The range includes The Cheviot (the highest hill), plus Hedgehope Hill, Windy Gyle, Cushat Law and Bloodybush Edge.\nThe hills are sometimes considered a part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland as they adjoin the uplands to the north. Since the Pennine Way runs through the region, the hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the Northumberland National Park.\nSome of the gems are in between the hills.\nHen Hole\nis one such place and it makes a wonderful route to the top of the Cheviot from the Hostel. It was created at the end of the last ice age, by meltwater, creating a deep gully with waterfalls, leading up to an amazing basin underneath the Cheviot summit. With some very easy scrambles, it makes a fantastic route to highest point in this whole range of hills.\nWildlife in the College Valley (not that we're guaranteed to see it all!)\nThe valley is well known for its population of\nferal goats\nand is home to around 150. Rumour has it that they were released in medieval times by the monks on Holy Island. This primitive British breed would have died out completely if they hadn't escaped into the wild. As farming changed there was a swing to foreign breeds which produced more milk. The goats can often be seen on the Newton Tors along the eastern side of the Valley. However they can pop up in the most unexpected of places! Over the years many goats have been re-homed to help manage environments elsewhere in the UK and this has helped to ease the pressure on local vegetation.\nRoe deer\nare present throughout the valley. Whilst they are beautiful they also bring their own challenges with damage to trees so their numbers are carefully managed.\nThe valley has a healthy population of\nred squirrels\n. Hazelnuts are a great source of proteins for the squirrels. With care and quiet you could be lucky and see one of these lovely little mammals.\nAdders\n, Britain's only venomous reptile are also present in the valley.\nSlow worms\n, which are really burrowing limbless lizards (commonly mistaken for snakes) are also common. They have been granted protected status along with all other native British reptiles.\nOtters\nare present along the College and Lambden burns.\nThere is a good population of\nrabbits\n,\nhares\n,\nvoles\n,\nfox\n,\nstoat\nand\nweasels\n. These can be seen throughout the valley.\nCollege Valley Estate has spent a lot of time and effort reintroducing\nblack grouse\n, a marvellous bird at risk of imminent extinction in the UK. Black grouse UK, part of the UK Biodiversity plan, is dedicated to reversing this trend towards extinction. In 1995 the Wilderness above Mounthooly was planted with over 55000 broadleaves. This became the largest new native woodland in England. Black grouse were initially quite successful but bad weather has affected recent breeding seasons and numbers have declined.\nThere is a healthy and well managed population of\nred grouse\non all the heather areas in the valley; shooting for these remarkable birds provides a significant income for the estate. The sound of them telling one to 'go-back, go-back, go-back' is one of the sounds of wilderness areas.\nDogs\n. This event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos.\nAll photos taken by Rob Mitchell, OutdoorLads and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join me for a winter walk around historic Stafford, including a visit to the castle where there will be time to freely explore the visitor centre and site. For those who would like to join some of our local ODL members for refreshment after the walk, we will be meeting at the Sun Inn which serves a variety of snacks and meals.\nStafford was founded in 913 by Aethelflaed, Lady of the Mercians. As well as being the administrative centre and county town of Staffordshire, it gained prominence through the Middle Ages as an important market town and later as an industrial centre with key industries being shoemaking, engineering and electrical industry.\nThe Ancient High House is believed to be the largest timber-framed town house in England and was built in 1595 for John Dorrington. After falling into disrepair in the 20th century, it was spared from demolition and saw extensive restoration between 1976-86.\nStafford Castle was built by the Normans on a hilltop to the west of the town in around 1090. Initially made of wood, it was later rebuilt of stone and has been rebuilt twice since. The latest gothic revival dates from the early 19th century and was built atop the earthworks and incorporates much of the original stonework. The final caretakers of the castle moved out in the winter of 1949 as the towers became structurally unsafe. The site was given over to the local authority in 1961 by Lord Stafford and, following works to make the castle remains safe as well as extensive professional excavations the site was opened to the public in 1988.\nThere is free year-round access to the castle site and we should also be able to access the on-site museum and enter the courtyard. There will be around 90 minutes to explore the castle at your own speed before we walk back into town.\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website. If you have any questions then feel free to message the leader if you have any questions.\nWhat if there's a waiting list?:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\nImage credits:\nAll pictures have been taken by the walk leader and permission is given to ODL for their use.",

    "Summary": "Come to the mountains with a sense of adventure and embrace the remoteness!\nThe\nCarneddau\nis the northern most mountain range within Eryri National Park (Snowdonia), and is often referred to as the largest area of continuous upland in the UK, south of Scotland. It contains a significant number of\nWales' highest peaks and high mountain lakes\n. Most importantly (for the purposes of this event), it also contains our basic and remote accommodation.\nThe bunkhouse is basic!\nNot \"basic\" in the sense that it's not a hotel... BASIC basic. This is going to be a true mountain adventure, with a degree of challenge and hardship, but with the satisfaction of waking up deep within the Carneddau, far from the nearest road.\nOur mountain Cottage is owned by a mountaineering club and is around a\n3 mile walk in from the nearest parking area\n, just south west of Llyn Eigiau, at about 420m. There are basic cooking facilities, alpine style bunks, a chemical toilet, solar lighting and a cold tap!\nThe first part of the weekend will involve the logistics of getting us, our gear and our provisions from the car park to the cottage. Nearer the time we will discuss how best to do this, depending upon arrival times, car sharing etc, maybe with two meeting/set-off times, depending on leader availability.\nEveryone will need to do a share of the carrying and other chores.\nThis includes cooking and cleaning, lighting and tending to the coal stove, heating water and \"administering\" the toilet facilities (this apparently requires the use of a spade!).\nTo aid your planning we will probably look to meet around 2-3pm on Friday to walk in though as there are only 8 people on this event we can probably be a bit flexible and agree a time.\nAside from our cottage chores, the main part of the weekend will, of course, involve a walk on the Saturday within the mountains which are, quite literally, on our doorstep. There are a number of options which we can do from the front door.\nAt the end of March it's anyone's guess what the weather will be like. We will need to be prepared for cold and wet conditions, and nearer the time we will study the forecast carefully to enable us to make plans.\nDogs:\nsorry,\nthis event is not suitable for dogs.\nMain photos provided by Rugby Mountaineering Club and used with permission.\nOther photos by Mark House and Neil Williams, used with permission.",

From the bunk barn we're able to get up to Scafell Pike (with a strong, experienced group), or the local, spectacular summits of Borrowdale.  If that's not your thing, Keswick is a 20 minute drive away with plenty of history, cafe's and boats on Derwent Water.\nFriday night will be the traditional ODL buffet, with breakfast across the weekend and Saturday evening dinner included in you price!\nThe bunk house is remote, 30 minutes walk from the nearest bus stop, serviced by the 78 bus from Keswick.  Parking is available, but tight, so lift sharing is recommended.\nThe bunk house sleeps 26 in a room of 18 and a room of 8.\nPhotos\nare used with permission of lav_rich and K Fellfarers",

    "Summary": "The woods are lovely, dark and deep / But I have promises to keep / And miles to go before I sleep / And miles to go before I sleep.\n(Robert Frost:\nStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\n)\nUnlike the poet and his little horse, we won't have that many miles to go before we sleep, just ten; it won't be evening but daytime; you may or may not have promises to keep; and the woods will probably not be filling with snow. I wouldn't want so much snow that the trains and roads were scuppered, but just the right amount to evoke wonder and nostalgia. We'll probably get no snow and the weather will be mild and murky and the ground muddy, but a man can dream. What we are guaranteed is typical Wealden comfortable countryside, venerable villages, cosy company, and a substantial spread at a lovely pub, The George in Eartham, a venue new to us and eager to have us.\nThe sights:\nSlindon:\nA delightful brick and flint village on the southern slopes of the Downs. Only 70 metres up, but with a glorious view across the Sussex Plain to the sea. It is quite unspoilt, so much so that the National Trust has taken charge of the entire place. St Mary's church is over-restored (1866), but there is a lot of value inside. C11 nave walls and C12 chancel. Mediaeval pews. Monument to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1539), the only wooden effigy in a Sussex church and very well carved. Several fine houses of all ages all around. Nore Folly is just outside the village. A battlemented arch, built 1814, the attached summerhouse built for shooting luncheons is long gone. Grade II-listed.\nEartham:\nA tiny, unspoilt village of flint and brick in lovely countryside. Eartham House, which we might glimpse, is by Edwin Lutyens and is from 1905. Not one of his more inspired designs.\nHalnaker:\nA pleasant straggle of houses along the Roman Stane Street. Old Halnaker House is C14, now ruined, but New Halnaker House is also by Lutyens, of 1938. Very late and heavy. The grounds of the house were used as a filming location for Doctor Who in 1985 for the story\nRevelation of the Daleks,\nstanding in for the planet Necros. The Doctor and Peri ran along then climbed over a flint wall which we'll see.\nBoxgrove:\nContiguous with Halnaker and Tangmere, a small and quiet place considering the size of its church. One pretty main street of the now familiar brick, flint and tile houses. Boxgrove Common Quarry became celebrated in 1993 when the tibia and two teeth of the earliest known member of the genus\nHomo\nfound in the UK was uncovered. Back in 500,000 BC\nHomo heidelbergensis\nwas roaming a coastal shoreline that existed at the time, setting up camp and hunting and butchering horse and rhinoceros.\nBoxgrove Priory:\nThe church of St Mary and St Blaise is rather French-looking with its steeply pitched roofs and flying buttresses. Surrounded by modest monastic ruins. Before the Dissolution in 1538 the old nave, lying to the west, served as the parish church. The huge great chancel is now the parish church. The rhythm of column and vault in it is most satisfying. The delicate floral patterns were painted in the vault spaces in the mid-C16. Another treasure of the church is the De la Warre Chantry of 1532. An exquisite gothic box that takes its design from a C15 French Book of Hours. The architecture is late gothic, but the decoration is a mix of gothic and classical, even including some putti supporting the family crests. The vault is carved pendants. The church is rich in other works of art, including a reredos by George Gilbert Scott and stained glass in an Arts and Crafts style.\nThe bus:\nThe Stagecoach No. 500 bus leaves Tangmere every 30 minutes at 23 and 53 minutes past. It takes 15 minutes to get to Barnham Railway Station. A single ticket costs £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll take the mixed-use path north along Barnham Lane from Barnham to Walberton, then West Walberton Lane to Fontwell. We'll use the subway under the A27 and wander through Slindon Woods. Having reached the village itself we will take Top Road briefly then a footpath west past Nore Folly. The footpath will continue west to get to Eartham. We will then cross further west to reach the A285 and take a footpath southwest then north to Halnaker Mill which is where we will have lunch. We will descend the hill, have a slight detour past Boxgrove Common and then walk along the A285 (along the pavement), to take The Street south to Boxgrove and its priory. Then using a footbridge over the A27, we will skirt round Tangmere to get to the bus stop.\n(Photo credits: View south across open field at the north end of Slindon:\nPhoto\n©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Easterly view from Nore Hill:\nPhoto\n©\nDave Spicer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Courthill Farm:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Wide Track in Eartham Woods:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The George Inn, Eartham:\nPhoto\n©\nKevin Gordon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

If the mood takes us, the evening may evolve and wander on elsewhere, but that decision can safely be left until the night itself.\nNewcomers, returners, regulars, and the merely intrigued are all warmly encouraged to join us.\nMore Chester Socials coming up 👋\nOur Chester socials take place bi-monthly, so this won’t be the only chance to join us this year. If you’d like to meet more people and enjoy relaxed social events in Chester, we also have socials planned for\nMarch\nand\nMay\n. Everyone is welcome, whether it’s your first event or you’ve joined us before.\nPhoto credit: all taken by Phil_30.",

    "Summary": "Join us for a weekend exploring the gravel trails of Dumfries and Galloway and help me in my mission to ride all the routes in the fantastic \"Gravel Rides Scotland\" book.  For clarity - I have not ridden these routes before, so will be exploring with the rest of you!\nWe will play things by ear a little given the weather and make final plans in the week leading up, but there are a few options.  For this reason, I am advertising the weekend as a package, but if you just want to come for one day then please get in touch.  I will also be planning to contact you all in the days leading up to confirm our plans, so if I don't already have your phone number then please keep a close eye on your messages on the website.\nRoute 1 leaves from Gatehouse of Fleet (page 49 in the book).  If we do the whole route it is 59km (37 miles) with 587 metres of elevation.  This route is easy to break up into smaller rides however, so if the weather isn't favourable or our legs are tired then we can do a shorter loop of this, possibly over 2 days.\nIf we are feeling good, then we can also do route 2 (page 57 in the book).  This is longer at 64km (40 miles) and 966metres of elevation.  it is also a bit more remote and without easy ways of shortening, so we will only do this if all are feeling good and the weather is favourable.\nI will be staying somewhere in the area on the Saturday night (venue tbc at present) so we will also aim for some social time on the Saturday evening.\nIf the weather forecast is really terrible then there is a small chance this event will be cancelled.\nThis event will be in conjunction with outMTB which is an LGBT off-road cycling club.\nThe ride leader is here to try and facilitate a fun weekend for all, but please remember you are responsible for your own decisions and safety and you should be self-sufficient on the ride.\nPhotos :\nTaken by andrew.g\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

    "Title": "The Keswick to Barrow Challenge 2026!",
    "Date": "Saturday Sat 09 2026",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Other Social and Team Events",
    "Places Left": "9",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "11",
    "Summary": "Got a New Year's resolution to take on a new challenge?  Fancying something to train for to get fit?  Or just a bit mad and like walking a long way in some beautiful Lakeland scenery?\nWell, this event could be for you - the Keswick to Barrow Challenge is back for 2026!\nWhat is it?\nWell, it's a very long walk - approximately 40 miles from just outside Keswick to Barrow-in-Furness with about 2000m of climb (spread out over a long way - it's not a mountain walk, don't worry!)\nBut it's more than that...\nIt's a charity fundraiser - we'll be collecting sponsorship to split between OutdoorLads and other charities nominated by the K2B Foundation who organise the event as well as the costs of running the event.\nIt's a massive achievement  - when you cross the finish line you'll feel amazing (and maybe think about doing it again next year?)\nIt's a huge event - with teams from all over the country, both smaller ones like ours and from big companies, fundraising for all manner of different charities.\nCan I actually do that?\nIt might be a long way - but as a bit of a veteran of quite a few endurance events your leader has every confidence!  You will want to do some training, though, few people can manage this sort of thing without.  Unsurprisingly the best form of training for walking is more walking...so why not sign up for some ODL walks and build up your distance!  There's no need to do super-long distances in training, though, just plenty of walking and be sure to try out any kit you're planning on using on the day.\nThe team\nThere's a minimum team size of 4 for the event (but we can enter more and we hope we will!) - however that's more for administrative reasons and we don't have to walk together throughout the event, so whether you're an accomplished ultramarathon runner and reckon you'll get round in 5 hours, or whether you're a walker who'd rather enjoy the scenery and take all day, it's all good.  If people do want to walk together that's also great, though, and we can provide each other some support along the way - there'll be plenty of time to talk about things like that on the run-up to the event.  Either way, you'll never be on your own with the hundreds of others taking part!\nAccommodation\nIf you live locally and can get dropped off at the start at the crack of dawn you don't necessarily need accommodation.  However for the rest of us we typically look at accommodation for the weekend in Barrow so there isn't far to go at the end of the walk (you'll probably not be in a fit state to drive anywhere!).  In previous years the Premier Inn (where your leader is staying) and Travelodge have offered good options but there's lots available so you can pick somewhere that suits your budget etc.  Don't book Saturday breakfast - you'll be up and out far too early for that :)\nWe usually meet up for a meal and a drink or two on the Friday early evening before a reasonably early night before the walk (and some walk related admin e.g. giving numbers out) - likely this will be near the Premier Inn but we can work that out depending on where people are staying.\nGetting to the start\nThe organisers provide what they call a \"Happy Bus\" coach service from many of the Barrow hotels to get you to the start - this leaves in the early hours of Saturday morning (3-4am!) which might be where the name came from (er!) - this is bookable at a small charge later on.  You can also have someone drop you off at the start if you have someone to do that but there is no parking available there so we do recommend the bus.  There isn't a bus the other way which is why we tend to stay in Barrow (also it tends to be a lot cheaper than Keswick for hotels etc).\nFundraising\nEach walker needs to raise £80 to take part in the event as a minimum, which is to be donated via the K2B website and not other sites e.g. JustGiving.  You'll get a personalised link to raise sponsorship which you can send out to as many people as possible to help reach your target!\nSounds great - how do I sign up?\nThere are a few things you'll need to do to get signed up:\nRegister an account on the K2B website at the below link and message the leader your Member ID so I can add you to the team when it has been set up.  If you already have a registration from previous years you can use the same one, you don't need to create a new one.\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/user/register\nSign up to this event page.\nOnce I've confirmed we have a minimum team of 4 signed up, book accommodation (this is at your own cost).  As prices can and do go up as the event approaches, it might be worth doing this sooner if there are suitable refundable options.  The leader is staying in the Premier Inn in Barrow but there are plenty of other options if that's not to your taste.  Don't book Saturday breakfast as you'll be leaving way too early for that!\nWhen looking for accommodation note the bus pickups are really early (around 3-4am).  The event buses do serve places other than Barrow itself but you'd need to get yourself from Barrow back to those places after the walk.\nNote that if we only have 4 and someone drops out that doesn't stop us walking - we just need a minimum of 4 signed up to confirm the team.\n(Provisional bus information:\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/happy-buses\n)\nYou will then need to pay your entry fee which is £15, and book your bus seat at £10.\nOnce we have the team all set up you'll be able to start collecting sponsorship via your own page on the K2B website - good luck!\nRemember there is a minimum commitment to raise £80 to be allowed to walk\n- this is the K2B's rule, not ours - so start in plenty of time :)\nDogs\nDogs are allowed on the K2B event itself BUT are not allowed on the event buses nor in most hotels, so if you intend to bring one (make sure it can walk 40 miles!) you will need to check arrangements carefully and arrange your own transport to the start (noting again that it's drop-off only, no parking is allowed anywhere near the start).  Dogs are allowed on the field at the finish but must be on a lead.\nObviously assistance dogs are allowed should you require one for a disability but please let the leader know if you are bringing an assistance dog so I can let the organisers know.\nPhoto credits\nThe photos on this event page were taken by previous participants/leaders including Danny McKeown-Henshall and are used with permission.",

Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around €11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli.

    "Summary": "This walk is a more challenging route, not for the fainthearted or those with less walking experience. A lot of the sections make use of unfrequented paths and there are several climbs (some that are fairly steep) spread throughout the walk.  If you are feeling fighting fit and want to test those legs, join Steven for this near thirteen mile rewarding round in the remote Yorkshire Dales.\nWaterfalls are a big feature of this walk and several are seen at close quarters, others glimpsed from afar. The deep valley of Upper Swaledale cuts into the Pennines and was justifiably chosen by Alfred Wainwright for his Coast to Coast route.  Mother nature has truly excelled here and the abandoned farmsteads just add to the feeling of isolation.\nWe follow part of Alfred Wainwright's route for almost a quarter of the walk , The leader walked this path on his first expedition twenty years ago, so expect many tales about this on the way downhill.\nThe walk starts with a climb up above the four hundred metre contour. There will be plenty of pauses for a breather/drink or photograph, Then, as the contours become kinder, extensive views are revealed on the watershed.  A lot of the nearby high Pennines are in view. Great Shunner Fell looks lofty from here and the limestone scars are seen at close quarters on the following descent.\nThe path down in the dale wanders through the maze of dry stone walls to the other side of the valley and, after a short break, another climb on an indistinct trail rises before a very gradual descent over grouse moor leads back to the River Swale and a small waterfall by a bridge.\nSeveral stone barns are passed as the route weaves up to the remote spot of Ravenseat. The farm has featured in a television series and the Yorkshire Shepherdess might greet us here.\nAnother slower ascent follows skirting a ravine before reaching a broader moor, passing another ruin and then above a tree-covered limestone scar descends to the opposite side of the Swale to Keld and a visit to a series of beautiful waterfalls.\nIf time allows, we will walk over to the inn on the other side of the village before doing the easy gradual descent of the walk.\nIf you would like a full day out and need a good bit of exercise please come along and see a remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales , You might be inspired to walk the 192 miles of the Coast to Coast yourself some time soon.\nThis route is suitable for well behaved dogs. There is livestock in many fields and there are some sections where your pet might need to be assisted over dry stone wall crossings.\nPhoto Credits - All photographs were taken by the walk leader.

A chance to connect and network with other leaders, share ideas and tips, inspiration, motivation and plans. There will be some training on offer to help upskill our leaders, and it's also a thank you from OutdoorLads to you for all you put into the organisation, without which - there would be no OutdoorLads! But don't worry - this IS NOT a weekend sat inside with post-it notes and flipcharts. We'll be very much getting outside, partaking in activities and getting to know each other!\nWe'll be staying in the Lodge at the site of our BIG Peaky Weekender event, so somewhere we know well. It is dormitory accommodation with good social spaces and not too many to a room. Located in the Peak District, the site is right on the Monsal Trail, has lots of opportunities for walking and cycling in particular. There will very likely be chance to visit a local public house over the weekend, we'll have use of the games room with table tennis tables and giant jenga, and a social evening on Saturday night. As leaders, you may well be approached to run an event over the weekend for others to join in with - you have been warned! :-P\nWe have use of the venue until 5pm on Sunday and we are planning to make full use of the weekend, so please plan to depart from 1pm onwards on the Sunday. For those who wish, there will be an optional Sunday lunch trip  (you will need to pay for that yourself.)\nAlthough primarily aimed at leaders in the Central, North East and Yorkshire,  and North West / North Wales regions, this is open to any  of our leaders. A similar event for the\nSouth East and South West / South Wales\nregions is taking place in February.\nTo note:\nThis event is heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads, and all food is provided over the weekend. However, travel expenses are not provided for this event. If that cost is a struggle for you, we don't want that to be a reason for you not to join us - please apply to the\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nfor help with that cost.\nAlthough the standard refund policy applies to this event, if you need to cancel, please do so as early as possible, so we can ensure the event is as full as possible with leaders who can benefit from the weekend.\nIf you are not yet a leader you will need to have applied and be well on with your leader application to join this event. If you're not sure if you should book or not, drop the office a line on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nand we'll chat it through with you. We will remove any bookings from members who are not leaders and haven't got an active leader application in.\nPhotos:\nW Allaway and used with permission.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.",

    "Summary": "Torridon - 3 nights\nJoin us for our annual winter mountaineering weekend walking in Torridon as we go in search of snow in the mountains!\nPlease remember that this is a winter mountain environment and we will be a small group. As such you should have a good level of fitness and be comfortable hiking in challenging terrain, using ice axes and crampons, as it is intended that we will be doing mountaineering in snow. If in doubt please message the event leader for guidance. The exact nature of activities on offer will be dictated by the weather conditions on the day - in the advent of adverse weather we will be doing low level walks in the local area as being on the mountain tops is not a place to be in wild weather!\nWe are staying in a bunkhouse at the head of Loch Torridon in among a collection of mountains that are highly regarded for their location and view, the big three being Liathach, Beinn Eighe and Beinn Alligin; but be warned even some of the smaller hills such as Beinn Damh to the south of the bunkhouse are also fantastic days out - what we do will be very much driven by the weather forecast. The hope is that there will be some snow about, and for that you will need to bring crampons and an ice axe - plus be proficient in their use.\nFor this bunkhouse you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

    "Summary": "The Derby '\nNomad Way\n' is an 80 km (50 mile) recreational route circumnavigating the City of Derby. The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley\n- Sat 22 November 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey - 8.8 km (5.5 miles)\nWe will visit St. Matthew's Parish Church in\nMorley\nto discover some in-built remains from Dale Abbey and view the Sacheverell-Bateman Mausoleum. The (converted) Tithe Barn and Dovecote at Morley Hall are also of interest.\nTh Church of St. Andrew, much restored in 1875, retains a few Norman features from its 12th century origin, a 14th century font and interesting Jacobean Pulpit.\nStanley\nColliery, closed in 1959, was a drift-mine or 'footrill', nicknamed 'Nibbl'um or 'Nibby Pit' due to the coal-owners constantly cutting wages. In former times, the smooth white sandstone from Stanley Quarry was used to produce 'donkey-stones' used for polishing theshold steps. The 'White Hart' is open all day for refreshments.\nReturn bus service (Black Cat) to Derby available from Stanley.\nThis is 'The Flourish' and site of the former 'Stanhope Arms', on the old Derby-Nottingham route. Legend had it that the notorious outlaw Uthlagas preyed on the traveller s but after dreaming of the Abbey in Depedale, he became a reformed character and then lived as a hermit.\nWe will take short detour from the route to visit Derbyshire's only remaining wooden post-mill - The Cat and Fiddle Windmill - built in 1788, where we will have lunch at the\nWindmill Farm Cafe\n.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nNote:\nIf there are no places left on this event, join the waiting list, as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nJoin our\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, or the more more local\nEast Midlands Telegram Chat Group\nand bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\nAll images taken by Darren (Derventio) or under Creative Commons Licence to modify, share and use for free with permission for ODL use.\nhttps://live.staticflickr.com/1003/5182457631_24c4a59e5a_b.jpg\nby Richard Miller\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/eamoncurry/6818310172/\nby The Roaming Picture Taker\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/eamoncurry/7202499668/\nby The Roaming Picture Taker",

    "Summary": "Important: One space has become available for this event. Due to demand, bookings are being managed off-line, so the one remaining place will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis by messaging the event leader.\nThe full price of the event is £516 for full and concession members, and £586 for PAYG members.\nIf you are interested in coming along, but the monastery is full, go to this\n\"Book Your Own Accoms\"\npage and you will still be able to join us!  In order to participate in the week's events you\nMUST\nbook through the \"BYOA\" page so that you are covered through the OutdoorLads insurance.\nSpend a week in the beautiful hills outside Rome and #getoutmore in Italy!  After almost 9 years, ODL returns to this beautiful 1,600 year old monastery 45 minutes northeast of Rome.  Fully modernised and capable of accommodating 12 guests, this building will be our base for a week of hiking and cultural immersion in the Lazio region.\nThis is a week away in Italy where the focus will be on getting out more and exploring the area on foot, enjoying the views and sights and the company of fellow OutdoorLads members; and a chance to enjoy the culture and tourist sights of Italy, too, rather than a chill-out holiday. So come and enjoy fantastic break away with us and get acquainted with this beautiful region!\nOur accommodation at the monastery features four twin-bedded rooms, and two double rooms (if you are coming as a couple or friends who don't mind sharing, please let the leader know!) and a full kitchen. Simple breakfasts, and tea and coffee are provided all week, as are two group evening meals. For the other evening meals you can self-cater, eat out, or those that wish to can shop, cook at eat together as a group - we can make arrangements for that when we arrive.\nNo transport is included, you will need to book and pay for all your own travel including flights and transport to the accommodation, and any transport whilst there. There is parking for four cars at the monastery if you wish to hire a car, but this would be at your own additional cost.\nItinerary and arrangements\nThe (adjustable) itinerary will look something like this. Please note that most tickets for attractions cannot be booked until at least 75 days in advance.  You would need to book and pay for tickets for any of these yourself, they are not included in the price.\nFriday 24 July\nShould you arrive at the monastery before 16.00, you will need to wait in the courtyard as there will be no access into the building.  I will meet the housekeeper at 16.00 and will need time to go through the preliminaries before allowing everyone in.\nThe train from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (Fiumicino Airport) to\nTivoli\ntakes around 2.5 hours, with a change required in Rome. Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around €11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli. Make sure you do not book to Tivoli Terme, as that is 30 minutes before Tivoli itself.\nThere are no activities planned for today, other than a communal dinner buffet.\nSaturday 25 July\nPlan on an early start to enjoy this (slightly longer than) 8.15km\nGrotto delle sirene\nloop through the village of Tivoli. We will walk down to the village from the monastery to the \"official\" starting point. This route covers very gently rolling village streets and paths, with an elevation gain of 160 metres and a loss of 150 metres.  Good trainers or walking shoes should should be adequate.\nLunch can either be brought from the monastery or can be purchased from one of the local shops.  Alternatively a trattoria lunch can be arranged at the end of the walk, as we will be in the village.\nSunday 26 July\nAs this is the last Sunday of the month the Vatican Museums\nMIGHT\nbe free (at least they were in 2025). If we decide to do this, the last entry into the Museum is at 12.30 so we would plan on leaving the monastery early, to try and avoid the queues as much as possible. Please note that shorts are\nNOT\nallowed inside the Vatican.\nThe Sistine Chapel is included on the free day, St Peter's Basillica is also free to enter but there will be security queues.\nAdditionally, for those interested there may be the option of attending the\nSunday Angelus\nin St Peter's Square, starting at 12.30. Please note that this only takes place when the Pope is in residence at the Vatican.  I will check the schedule as this day gets closer.\nFor those that prefer to stay at the monastery you will need to ensure that you have all your daily supplies as the shops and stores in Tivoli will most likely be closed today. There is the option of visiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n, but cannot be booked until Spring 2026.\nDinner may be a cookout at the monastery or some restaurants may be open.\nMonday 27 July\nAnother early start will see us exploring this 11.5km\nPonte Nomentano\n\"linear\" loop along the Aniene River. This requires the use of public transport (50 minutes by bus each way) or private car to the start / end point and that will be advised upon during the event.\nThis walk is completely flat, along the banks of the Anien River.  Good trainers or walking shoes should be adequate, but bear in mind there may be mud if there has been any rain. There are several restuarants / cafes at the 6km turn-around point that might work for lunch; we will just need to see what is open.\nTuesday 28 July\nToday will see us venturing into Rome to explore this ancient city.  Independent options could include:\nRome \"hop on - hop off\" bus tour;\nTickets\nshould be purchased in advance, starting at €26 per person.\nExplore the city on your own, taking in sites like Vatican City, the\nColosseum\n(multiple ticket options, starting from €53) or the \"\nEat, Pray, Love\n\" movie\nfilming locations\ntour.\nExplore\nSt Peter's Basillica\n(free to enter but there will be long security queues)\nFor the foodies you can try and visit the 13 best\ngelaterias\nin Rome!\nExplore the\nJewish Ghetto\n, which actually dates back to 1555 when it was created by Pope Paul IV Carafa.\nBe the ultimate tourist and toss coins into the Trevi Fountain (one coin \"ensures\" your return to Rome, two coins increases your chances of finding true love in the near future, and three coins ensures coins 1 and 2, as well as ensuring marriage in the Eternal City - coins must be tossed over your right shoulder using your left hand), walk down the Spanish Steps, or stroll down the\nVia Condotti\n(Rome's luxury shopping street).\nPartake in any one of the free (only pay what you want)\nwalking tours\nof Rome.\nAs the streets are virtually all cobblestone, good, solid soled shoes are highly recommended. Dinner this evening will be a special event (paid individually), at a restaurant in Rome to be decided upon later.\nWednesday 29 July\nToday we venture \"uphill\" from the monastery, taking in this 12.8km\nSughereta di Sirividola\nloop. This hike starts just down the main road from the monastery so no transport is needed. This hike is mostly on mountain paths, with an elevation gain of 460 metres and a loss of 450 metres.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nAnother option, if you so desire, could be returning to Rome to attend the free\nPapal Audience\nin St Peter's Square.  Again this is obviously ties to the Holy Father's summer schedule.`\nDinner this evening can either be communal back at the monastery or at any of the local tavernas.\nThursday 30 July\nToday is our last full day in this incredible location so let's make the most of it! For those that are not too knackered from yesterday's hike, there is this 8.45km\nTivoli to Monte Catillo\nloop through the hills above Tivoli. This hike should be a bit less strenuous than yesterday's but still has an elevation gain of 330 metres, and a loss of the same.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nFor those not interested in hiking today, cultural options include:\nVisiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n. Please note that you cannot book tickets until Spring 2026.\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the village, following any one of these 3\nitineraries\n.\nCompletely spoil yourself at the\nAqua Albule\nthermal spa, about 20 minutes by train from Tivoli. Use of the pool is around €17; full access to the thermal spa is around €45 and includes use of the sauna, \"flavoured\" and \"sailing\" showers (don't ask as I have no idea!!!) and hydrotherapy. Please note that ODL accepts no responsibility for your use of these facilities.  As always you should check with your GP to see if these services are right for you.\nDinner tonight will be a communal affair at the monastery, with a special \"theme\" to be announced early in the week.\nFriday 31 July\nSadly, our Roman adventure comes to an end today.  We will need to check out of the monastery by 10.00am, before which we will do the traditional \"ODL hostel clean\".\nIf you are flying back to the UK today please try not to book your departing flight before 16.00, as it is at least 2 hours on the bus / train, including a change in Rome.\nIf you are staying on in Rome for any additional days, please do not book your transport from Tivoli before 11.00, in order for everyone to participate in the clean-up.\nRome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is served by virtually every major airport in the UK, using EasyJet, RyanAir, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling and WizzAir.  Rome Ciampino Airport (approximately 1 hour south of Rome) is served by RyanAir (from Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and London Stansted - please note that flight days can vary).\nShould you wish to arrive in Rome before the 24th, or stay after the 31st, please note that all costs will be your own to incur and you will not be able to stay on longer at the monastery.\nIt is strongly recommended that you secure travel insurance to cover not only the hiking activities, but also flight delay or cancellation, baggage delays, medical care and, if necessary, repatriation.\nPay in instalments\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. This is how the event leader has chosen to pay - so it's no hardship.\nExamples of instalment options, but we're happy to discuss options with you:\nBook during October: Eight payments of £64.50\nBook during November: Seven payments of £73.72\nBook during December: Six payments of £86.\nYou will need to have fully paid up by the start of June.\nPhotos:\nPhotos provided\nwww.unsplash.com\n, OutdoorLads members and the monastery and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.",

In the evening there are parties every nite some are themed (fancy dress) and are great fun. In between there is apres ski at the end of the day and the spa (if you have access) .\nFor more info:-\nEuropean Snow Pride website\n.\nEuropean Snow Pride on facebook\n.\nPLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO EUROPEAN SKIING EVENTS THIS ONE, (EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE ESP) AND EUROPEAN GAY SKI WEEK  EGSW SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNING UP TO THE ONE YOU WANT TO ATTEND , ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE BOOKED ON ONE. THIS EVENT IS FOR EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE in TIGNES\nThere is a WhatsApp group to assist people in communicating to book / share accommodation and to communicate and arrange to meet up whilst there. See the link in the location information below to join.\nPlease read the info on here carefully and on the ESP website, feel free to ask questions on the comments section below or in the whatsapp group.\nACCOMMODATION\nThere are lots of options see the\nEuropean Snow Pride website\nfor details.\nWhen booking for accommodation is open. I recommend booking ASAP as the best accommodation offers sell out early and the cost increases a little every month !\nThere are standard accommodation options that are eligible for the outdoorlads discount (\n€35 pp for non special offer accom booked with an Event Pass+6 day lift pass see\nODL Discount\n.), and there are the special offer accoms ranging from approx £400 to £700 these are already really good value so they are not discounted.\nYou will need to pay 25% on booking and the remainder 1 month before the event.\nI will be booking the deluxe special offer (£764pp (increases monthly)), a lot of the outdoorlads book this as is really good value and it makes shareing with other outdoorlads simple. The apartments are great, it is close to the slopes and it has access to the fantastic spa. This includes both event and lift passes. So just flights, transfers and spending money on top.\nThe apartments are for 5 people but you don't need to arrange who you are sharing with till later so I recommend booking to secure a place as this will sell out. (There are lots of other options and the non special offer accom is eligible for discount). If you are on a tight budget the standard special is great value at £500.\nIf you have got your own group together then great , if not message on the WhatsApp group , see link in the location information below to join the group, ask if any other outdoorlads are looking to share. With the special offer accom , snowpride will allocate you an apartment with others you request to share with and/or will fill spaces with others on snowpride. I have shared with others i didn't know in the past and found it a great way to make new friends.\nSKIING/SNOWBOARDING\nThere are daily guided groups for intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders and ski school available for beginners. This year each guided group will be accompanied by an ESP promoter and a professional ski guide from evolution 2.\nEuropean Snow Pride Ski options\n.\nYou can hire  your equipment  from ESP also.\nEVENT PASS ETC\nTo participate in the ski groups, a client must either purchase an Event Pass Premium, or an Event Pass Standard plus a supplement for ski and snowboard groups.\nThe standard includes the evening parties but not the daytime guided ski groups or the pool party.\nThis makes it more flexible so that if you do not use the guided ski groups or go to the pool party it will be cheaper for you. You can add the pool party or the guided groups to the Standard pass as an optional extra.\nIf you are intending to do the guided ski groups and pool party then it is more cost effective to get the premium.\nFull details on the types of event pass here;:\nhttps://www.europeansnowpride.com/fr/pass-evenement-gay-ski-week/\nGETTING THERE\nYou need to organise your own transport .\nSee\nEuropean Snow Pride travel options\n.\nWhen booking flights to the resort the transfers usually leave the airports before 3pm on Saturday and are not likely to arrive back at the airport until after 3pm on the return journey. So please bear this in mind when booking flights. (As in, early flight on arrival and late flight on return. There have been many occasions with a late return transfer as Saturday is change over day for the whole of the french alps! The traffic is usually extremely congested, do not be misled by google travel times that are not for Saturday! Several people have missed flights booked too early in the day.)\n(ESP photos copyright Franck Weens\nwww.weens.fr\nand Andréa Emmanuelli - Lezak\nwww.andrew-grey.com\nand European Snow Pride)",

    "Summary": "If you've never or seldom been on a mountain walk but really wanted to, this is the walk for you!\nJoin Fabian and Lee for a 9 mile (14.4 km) walk up Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales.\nAimed at the novice mountain walker, we will go at a pace that suits the slowest members of the group. Having said that, even though this is a beginners mountain walk, you will still have to have a minumum level of fitness required. Therefore, we recommend only registering for this walk if you can walk the same distance on a relatively flat terrain.\nThe Route\nThe route up to Ingleborough from Clapham is perhaps the finest and most scenic. We start in the picturesque village of Clapham, complete with a river running through the middle. From here we walk along good country tracks gently up through a woodland, and then drop down to the riverside as the valley gets narrower.\nWe follow this river until we meet some classic Yorkshire Dales limestone crags and head through a narrow gorge where there are small bolts drilled in for climbers. But you have to look closely!\nOnce through this dramatic gorge, we begin striking up toward Ingleborough on good tracks. Open farmland gives way to open moorland and we'll begin to see the summit of Ingleborough in the distance. The summit itself is a large wide plateau - once used as an Iron Age hill fort.\nOnce we've taken a picture or two of the group (and any views if we're not in the middle of a cloud), we'll retrace our steps back. On the return route though, we'll continue along the river all the way through the forest back into Clapham.\nPost-Walk Food\nIt's not part of the official trip, but we may see if we can stay on for a pub meal for those that want to. But we'll decide on the day!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but, like the owner, you must be certain your dog can do both the distance and the climb (up and down).\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nImage Credits:\nAll images taken by the event leaders with permission for ODL use.",
