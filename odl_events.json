    "Summary": "Work off the turkey with a Boxing Day walk around Totnes and the River Dart\nThe route is as follows:\n1. **Totnes Town Centre to the River Dart**\nBegin your walk in Totnes town centre. Head north out of town, crossing the River Dart. Take a moment to enjoy the view of the river, which has long been central to Totnes‚Äôs history and trade.\n2. **Riverside Path towards Dartington**\nFollow the path north-west, keeping the river close on your right. The route soon opens into fields and gentle countryside. Look out for wildlife along the riverbanks.\n3. **Into Dartington Estate**\nContinue towards Dartington. The estate is known for its historic hall, gardens, and ancient woodlands. You‚Äôll pass through lanes and farmland here, with views across the valley.\n4. **Northern Loop by Staverton**\nSkirt towards the small village of Staverton. You won‚Äôt enter the village centre on this route, but you‚Äôll be close to its edge. Here the walk loops eastwards, climbing gently before turning south. This section gives wide views across the South Hams countryside.\n5. **Heading South back to Totnes**\nThe return route follows quiet tracks and lanes back towards Totnes. You‚Äôll cross the River Dart again near the railway, not far from the South Devon Railway line, where steam trains often run ‚Äì a real treat if you spot one!\n6. **Final Stretch into Town**\nFrom the riverside, head back through Totnes‚Äôs historic streets to your starting point. There are plenty of caf√©s, pubs, and shops to enjoy at the end of your walk.\nAll photos taken by Outdoorlads members.

    "Summary": "The North Norfolk coast is famous for its long, sandy beaches and whilst we won't be able to enjoy long hot sunny days on the beach (although who knows with the weather this year!) we can still enjoy all that this stunning part of the UK has to offer, so come join us for the Southeast Christmas 2025.\nSheringham is located on the North Norfolk coast and our accommodation is in town. ¬†This provides great opportunities for shopping (think about those last minute Christmas presents) as well as a chance to enjoy the local coffee shops and pubs or just the ability to walk on the long sandy beach!\nThe Accommodation\nWe have used this hostel a number of times and you can expect dormitory style accommodation with some spare beds available allowing us to spread-out throughout the building, there is a decent size lounge and with a bit of OutdoorLads festive magic, we'll soon have the common area's looking like Santa's Grotto!\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect if this is your first OutdoorLads Christmas event.\nFriday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday. Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge, with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. Bring along something to feed one or two people, and home-cooked is always preferred.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge, or perhaps enjoy some board games (don't forget to bring your favourites).\nSaturday\nAfter breakfast on Saturday morning you'll head out on your choice of activity (we'll list these out below as they are confirmed), returning to our accommodation early afternoon. This means you will likely need a packed lunch that you will need to bring yourself.\nFor those of you that like your Parkrun on a Saturday morning, Sheringham has you covered and we'll time our daytime activities to give you a chance to do both.\nOutdoorLads hostel events always rely on everyone mucking in and helping in the kitchen over the weekend and Christmas is no different, so whilst a few volunteers are busy in the kitchen, we'll hopefully have some Christmas themed activities in the lounge including our traditional Secret Santa.\nIt wouldn't be a Christmas hostel without Christmas dinner. You can expect a starter, traditional Christmas roast, vegan option and all the trimmings followed by dessert.\nWe'll need some volunteers to clear up in the kitchen and dining room, but once that's done it will be a chance to relax and digest, there could be some music on but I'm sure the board games will be in full swing again.\nSunday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much tea/coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nOur plan is to offer a short walk or cultural event on the Sunday for those that are not in a hurry to leave, but this is subject to volunteers stepping up to lead this for you!\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nCar Sharing\nChristmas is the time for sharing, so if driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our Southeast events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/joinchat/N2IyUFkBzJRyiZQpqlm6ZQ\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event¬† must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible¬†for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇComplete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.)

You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‚Äòin charge‚Äô or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‚Äòtechnical experts‚Äô but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre‚Äôs staff.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly &¬†confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you‚Äôve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there‚Äôs plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n-¬†Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power.¬†With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it‚Äôs excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The¬†bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n¬£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n¬£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n¬£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n¬£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n¬£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n¬£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

The route will be around the 10 mile mark (pub diversion included) and mostly on tracks and quiet lanes.\nEwelme is one of those quintessential Oxfordshire villages off the main roads that seems like it belongs in another time, with a stream running through it, which is used to grow watercress of all things. The school building here is the oldest in continuous use as a school in Britain.\nThe walk heads east out of the village and then north towards the oddly named Britwell Salome, following the Shakespeare's Way footpath, and then on to Brightwell Baldwin, another timeless village of thatched ivy-covered cottages, 17th-century pub and a classic red phone box.\nAfter lunch, we will make our way back south to Ewelme for a well-deserved pint at the Shepherd's Hut pub.\nDogs\n: Well-behaved dogs (and owners!) are welcome on the walks, do bear in mind this is agricultural countryside so there may be livestock and they will need to be on a lead if we encounter any. There are some busy road crossings to be mindful of also, and a few stiles.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting.¬†What will¬†happen, who will be there, and what can you¬†expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.",

Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a ‚Äì 8a.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised and will need to book onto a future beginners event. ¬†If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

The exact nature of activities on offer will be dictated by the weather conditions on the day - in the advent of adverse weather we will be doing low level walks in the local area as being on the mountain tops is not a place to be in wild weather!\nWe are staying in a bunkhouse at the head of Loch Torridon in among a collection of mountains that are highly regarded for their location and view, the big three being Liathach, Beinn Eighe and Beinn Alligin; but be warned even some of the smaller hills such as Beinn Damh to the south of the bunkhouse are also fantastic days out - what we do will be very much driven by the weather forecast. The hope is that there will be some snow about, and for that you will need to bring crampons and an ice axe - plus be proficient in their use.\nFor this bunkhouse you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on¬†in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

    "Summary": "Join Ben for a quiet and relaxed weekend on the North Devon Coast.\nThis early year weekend is the perfect chance to¬†get some fresh sea air in peaceful countryside. ¬†OutdoorLads hostels are a great way to quickly meet new friends and find out about what we do.¬†Attending your first hostel event could be a daunting experience if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen so why not have a read of our '\nMy First Hostel Event\n' guide.\nYenworthy is a fully accessible hostel hidden away in a wooded valley on the outskirts of Exmoor making for¬†a warm and comfortable retreat from the depths of Winter. ¬†With three rooms to socialise in along with an undercover area outside and a fire pit area there's plenty of space to play board games or chat away and make new friends aswell as catching up with old ones over the weekend.\nFriday evening:\nArrive, settle in and meet with fellow ODLers. ¬†A simple evening meal (included in the event cost) will be provided followed by a welcome meeting. ¬†The rest of the evening is yours to enjoy.\nSaturday:\nAfter breakfast (included in the event cost) we'll head out for an 8 mile walk taking in the South West Coast Path. You will need a relatively good level of fitness for the walk.\nPlease bring a packed lunch\nand maybe a flask of hot drink if it's cold.\nIf you don't fancy coming on the walk, you can choose to stay in the hostel or explore nearby Lynton and Porlock Weir.\nSaturday evening:\nRelax and socialise or help out preparing the 2 course evening meal (included in the event cost) which we'll all enjoy.\nSunday\nAfter breakfast we'll help clean and tidy away leaving the hostel as we found it. ¬†After that you can explore the North Devon Coast.\nACCESIBILITY:\nAs mentioned this hostel is accessible to wheelchair users, with a hoist system available in some rooms and we have the ability to make additional arrangements to support a carer attending if needed. ¬†This means that whilst our walk along the coastal path might not be suitable, we would love to offer the opportunity to attend to someone that might not normally be able to join Outdoorlads events. ¬†If this is you please reach out to\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nso we can ensure we can cater to all of your needs.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nOur location provider has asked that no nuts are to be brought onto the site.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly &¬†confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you‚Äôve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there‚Äôs plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n-¬†Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power.¬†With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it‚Äôs excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The¬†bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n¬£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n¬£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n¬£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n¬£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n¬£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n¬£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

The cost will be ¬£60 + ¬£8 course fee.\nAfter¬†signing up, members will be messaged with instructions on how to book¬†direct with MountainXperience.\nThis course will be led by an OutdoorLads Leader and run jointly with his own outdoor business so there will be non-ODL members on the course with you.¬†Places are very¬†limited so please only sign up if you're certain you're able to attend.\nIf you're not local to the Peak District¬†you'll need to arrange your own accommodation nearby.\nYou can find out more about the course and a full syllabus at\nhttps://www.mountainxperience.uk/activities/silver-nnas-navigator-award-peak-district/\nPhotos:\nProperty of hellosimon¬†and used with permission by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

Both those towns are within easy reach for simple day walks and their respective tourist attractions. Alternatively, some more dramatic mountain walking can be found within a short drive.\nThe activities:\nas we'll have two full days at our disposal, there will be an opportunity to take maximum advantage of this varied, beautiful region. Exact walks on offer will depend upon leaders attending, but will likely include at least one easier and one tougher walk each day. Wales' highest waterfall (Pistyll Rhaeadr) isn't far, with the adjacent Berwyn Mountains. Llangollen is always popular, as is the fascinating Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.\nNew Year's Eve:\nwhile this event is not intended to be a \"party event\", we will, of course, mark the arrival of the new year. Think dinner with friends, silly games, and general merriment :)\nThe accommodation\n: Our accommodation is well-equipped and comfortable, across a bunkhouse and cottages, with shared rooms of varying sizes (max. 8).

    "Summary": "Please note, this walk is subject to the Thames Path reopening at Richmond Lock in October. Should it be delayed, the walk will take a shorter route (7.75km/4.8 miles), via Syon Park and back to Brentford Station.\nFollowing my series of art deco inspired architecture walks earlier this year in central London, we head out to Brentford to follow the Grand Union Canal and the Great West Road. Here we discover its industrial heritage and history of this well-known arterial road and art deco gems, before heading to the more tranquil Thames Path, via Richmond and Kew, then return to Brentford Station.\nPoints of interest\nThe Great West Road\nIt is now 100 years since King George V opened the A4 Great West Road. When JB Priestley set out on his English Journey, on a motor coach from Victoria Coach Station, in 1933, he wrote of the Great West Road that: \"Being new, it did not look English, we might suddenly have rolled into California.\"¬†That is true given the popularity of Art Deco architecture around the world and particularly in the US.\nOn this tour I will take you past some of what remains of this unique corridor of Art Deco industrial architecture and hear about some of the now listed and lost buildings of the inter war era including:\n1. Currys building, by FE Simpkins 1936, restored for JCDecaux\n2. The Pyrene building, by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners, 1930. Now Westlink House\n3. Site of American Packard's cars British importer - Leonard Williams Ltd. Wallis, Gilbert and Partners 1931, destroyed by a V2 rocket\n4. Site of the Firestone Tyre and Rubber building 1928, by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners, before it was controversially demolished in 1980\n5. Coty Company of Suresnes nr Paris, by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners 1932. Now the Syon Clinic\n6. Gillette Razor Company, Grade II listed by Sir Banister Fletcher, 1937. Following an extensive refurbishment it is set to become a state of the art creative studio space\n7. Former National Provincial Bank building by WFC Holden, 1936. Part of the soon to open refurbished Gillette complex\nBrentford\nThe name is recorded as Breguntford in 705 in an Anglo-Saxon charter and means ford over the River Brent. Historically part of Middlesex, in the southeastern corner of Elthorne Hundred, it has formed part of Greater London since 1965.\nThe Grand Union Canal\nIn January 1929 the Grand Junction Canal was bought by the Regent's Canal and amalgamated with other canals to form the Grand Union Canal.\nRichmond on Thames\nRichmond preserves its character with an expansive green surrounded by Queen Anne and Georgian houses leading to an archway, which is all that remains of the former Palace.

Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched').

The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley\n- Sat 22 November 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey - 8.8 km (5.5 miles)\nWe will visit St. Matthew's Parish Church in\nMorley\nto discover some in-built remains from Dale Abbey and view the Sacheverell-Bateman Mausoleum. The (converted) Tithe Barn and Dovecote at Morley Hall are also of interest.\nTh Church of St. Andrew, much restored in 1875, retains a few Norman features from its 12th century origin, a 14th century font and interesting Jacobean Pulpit.\nStanley\nColliery, closed in 1959, was a drift-mine or 'footrill', nicknamed 'Nibbl'um or 'Nibby Pit' due to the coal-owners constantly cutting wages. In former times, the smooth white sandstone from Stanley Quarry was used to produce 'donkey-stones' used for polishing theshold steps. The 'White Hart' is open all day for refreshments.\nReturn bus service (Black Cat) to Derby available from Stanley.\nThis is 'The Flourish' and site of the former 'Stanhope Arms', on the old Derby-Nottingham route.

A detour could be made here, via Coach Drive, for an opportunity to view the Millennium Topograph on Bunker's Hill behind 'Montpelier'.\nQuarndon was visited by Daniel Defoe in 1727, by which time the medicinal and 'curative' waters of the Chalybeate (Ka-Lib-e-at) Well had aquired rame and aspirations for the development of an important 'Spa'. A series of earth tremors, after around 1863, disrupted the 'spring' and the flow finally ceased from the Lion's Head Pourer following a major tremor in 1956. The ornate, castellated stone enclosure to the spring can be seen half-way down Church Road adjacent to the 'Joiners Arms'.\nReturn bus service (109, Mon to Say only) to Derby available from Quarndon.\nSt. Alkmund's Church in Duffield is adjacent to an ancient crossing of the River Derwent, south of the main village. This religious site, during Anglo-Saxon times, was probably a refuge for travellers. The earliest remains of the existing building are from the Norman period. Duffield Bridge was constructed in 13th century and subjected to later widening for the Chesterfield Turnpike in 1812. Looking downstream, dominating the skyline on the eastern bank, can be seen the brick chimney of Peckwash Mill. Originally a corn mill in 13th century but later, a paper mill of massive importance, being the largest producer of paper in the world during its heyday.\nReturn bus service (The Sixes) to Derby available from Duffield.\nOn the other side of the bridge we pass the 'Bridge Inn' pub.\nThe 'Derby Nomad Way' begins to share part of its route here with ¬†the 'Midshires Way' and the 'Centenary Way' passing through Eaton Deer Park which existed during the Middle Ages.\nAt this junction, on the outskirts of Little Eaton between the main settlement and Coxbench is the 'Bell and Harp' pub.\nReturn bus service (7.1, 9.2 or Amberline) to Derby abailable from 'Bell and Harp'.\nIn the field, before reaching Morley Moor Farm, the route again crosses the line of Ryknild Street on its way north to Templeborough (Rotherham).\nThe 'Three Horseshoes Inn' is available here for refreshments at the end of the walk, if desired.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you‚Äôll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don‚Äôt match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a ‚Äì 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices. We ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇComplete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive)\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇPay the Lifetime Registration Fee - ¬£6.00\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇPay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - ¬£9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇHire shoes (if you don‚Äôt have your own) - ¬£3.50*\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇHire a harness (again, if you don‚Äôt have your own) - ¬£3.50*\n-‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇHire shoes and harness - ¬£6.00*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

I will happily show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nEvent pages are split into\nBEGINNER & EXPERIENCED.\nPlease ensure you sign up to the correct event as only two beginners are allowed to be signed in to be supervised per leader.\nThis event is for beginner climbers (those needing to be supervised) only!\nIf you are competent with how to tie in & belay, then you will need to\nsign up to the accompanying experienced event\ninstead.\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nIf the event is full, please join the waiting list. If other leaders are able to attend, I may be able to increase numbers.\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event. Spaces for beginners are limited & 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors!

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly &¬†confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors!

    "Summary": "'A Yuletide Tudor Trail' was a possible title for this walk, because the shadow of the second Tudor monarch, his second wife and his second daughter will loom large over this festive foray around quiet lanes, along the valley of the River Eden and into the High Weald of Kent. We'll even finish at a pub named after him. As we proceed to Markbeech and then to Chiddingstone and back to Hever (alas, not seeing the latter's castle) we'll encounter cosy cottages, charming churches, tranquil tracks, whispering woodlands and pleasant pastures. The Christmassyness will climax at lunchtime at The Castle Inn at Chiddingstone when we'll banquet beneath the fifteenth-century beams.\nThe sights:\nMarkbeech:\nA small hamlet with a Victorian church perched high up on the northernmost sandstone ridge of the High Weald AONB.\nCowden:\nAll we'll just see of this place is the tiny, secluded Hole Cottage which is¬†the remaining wing of a once much larger late-medieval hall house. Now a holiday cottage let by the Landmark Trust.\nChiddingstone:\nA unique and¬†perfect example of a Tudor one-street village, so perfect, that the whole place is in the care of the National Trust. It's quite a film star too, as it featured in the¬†1985 Merchant Ivory film\nA Room With a View,\nMichael Winner's 1983\nThe Wicked Lady\nand¬†the outdoor scenes of the BBC's 1971\nElizabeth R\n, starring Glenda Jackson. St Mary's Church is opulent, C14 and C15, and has the tombs to the Streatfeild family (you may have heard of Noel, the author) who lived at early C19 Chiddingstone Castle. The village takes its name from the Chiding Stone, a Saxon judicial place or boundary marker and place of public correction or 'chiding'. Plus, we're having lunch at the C15 Castle Inn -¬†how cool is that?\nHever:\nMore pleasant timber-framed original and mock-Tudor cottages, including our last pub stop, the Henry VIII. St Peter's Church contains the tomb of Thomas Boleyn of Hever Castle, father of Anne Boleyn and grandfather of Elizabeth I. Unfortunately, we won't see Hever Castle, childhood home of Anne.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll follow a lane to Uckfield Lane which we'll soon leave to follow a footpath south through Oak Wood. Upon recahing Cowden Poubd Road we'll turn east into Markbeech, before following a footpath round to Horseshoe Green where we'll pick up a footpath to Buckhurst farm. We'll then follow Truggers Lane east then Rywell Road and Wellers Town Road north. We'll then be on Chiddingstone Road which will take us west to the pub. A permissive path through the grounds of Chiddingstone Castle will allow us to get to Hill Hoath Road which we'll follow south before picking up the Eden Valley Walk through Hever back to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields and woods for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Along the route, we‚Äôll see riverside paths, historic buildings, and maybe even some swans, sheep, and other farm animals as we cross into the more rural areas.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nSankey Valley Park & Canal:\nWe‚Äôll follow the course of the historic Sankey Canal, one of Britain‚Äôs first, now transformed into a tranquil green corridor. Expect easy walking with plenty of opportunities to spot swans, ducks, and herons along the water.\nNewton-le-Willows & Surroundings:\nPassing through the historic town and Earlestown, we‚Äôll see reminders of the area‚Äôs railway and mining heritage before heading out to Newton Common ‚Äì a broad open green space with wide views of the surrounding countryside.\nCollins Green & Vulcan Village:\nThe route then loops into quieter farmland and the historic Vulcan workers‚Äô village, where we‚Äôll see cottages, rural lanes, and fields often filled with sheep or other livestock, giving a real taste of the area‚Äôs industrial and agricultural past.\nThis is a relatively flat walk with gentle terrain, making it suitable for a wide range of abilities. We‚Äôll have time to stop for snacks and enjoy the scenery along the way.\nWe‚Äôll finish the walk back in Newton-le-Willows, and for those who‚Äôd like to continue the day, we‚Äôll head to\nThe Pied Bull\n, just 750m from the station. It‚Äôs a great spot for a drink together, and they also serve Sunday lunch if you‚Äôd like to stay for food.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are welcome on this walk, but please ensure they are under control at all times, particularly around livestock and in public spaces. Owners are responsible for their dogs, including cleaning up after them and assisting them over stiles or obstacles.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you‚Äôre very welcome to join us!

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre‚Äôs staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event¬† must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible¬† for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering¬†events in the South East, so why not check out¬†what's coming up near you¬†here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n. Alternatively, stay updated on upcoming events using the social media channels below:\nTelegram\n(Climbing and bouldering only):\nOutdoorLads (SE) Climbing\nFacebook:\nhttp://fb.com/OutdoorLadsSouthEast\nTwitter:\n@OdlSouthEast\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful. All levels are welcome!\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome\n. If you're new to climbing, we've¬†got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity. I keep our group tight-knit to foster connection and ensure personalised coaching for everyone, regardless of your experience level. Many climbers started their journeys relatively ‚Äúlate‚Äù in life, incl. some session leaders\nü§´\nWe convene at the\nClimbing Hangar in Reading\n, one of the largest climbing centres in the region. The generously spacious and friendly cafe/lounge is my personal favourite where you can find us socialising, having a cuppa, snacks or even pizza before and after the climbs.\nIf you have never climbed at the Climbing Hangar in Reading before, you must book an induction slot:\nhttps://www.theclimbinghangar.com/locations/reading\n- follow instructions to book an induction slot around the time that this event starts.\nYou also need to\ncomplete the waiver form that is linked in the confirmation email\nonce you've booked an induction slot.\nThis only needs to be done once.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Enjoy a pre-Christmas hike around the popular Happy Valley area of Coulsdon. The terrain will be varied and we'll see some stunning scenery on route. If that wasn't enough there are plenty of historic points and landmarks to keep us entertained. Near the end we can also enjoy a Christmas drink before our return.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nFarthing Downs\nThe most extensive area of semi-natural downland left in London.¬† Views are offered over a great distance.¬† There are also cows roaming freely as they graze.¬† History is also paramount here.¬† The site is believed to go back to Neolithic times with evidence of a historical past dotted around.\nSt Peter and St Paul Church\nWork started on the church before 1086 and it is still in use today.¬† The church is famous for having a wall painting believed to have been done around 1170.¬† Amazingly, the painting was only discovered during restoration works in 1870-1.¬† It has been described as ‚Äúperhaps the most interesting ancient wall-painting in England‚Äù.\nHappy Valley\nThe general name for the whole area.¬† Originally, things were known as the Coulsdon Greenbelt Lands.¬† That is obviously quite a stuffy name so in 1970 the name was changed to Happy Valley Park.\nSt Lawrence's Hospital Burial Ground\nThe Caterham Metropolitan Asylum, later known as St Lawrence‚Äôs Hospital opened in 1870.¬†Between this time and 1915 the burial ground was used to facilitate the hospital.¬† The site is now a place of history but graves and a memorial garden remain.¬† The site of the former chapel is visible.\nCoulsdon Common\nAnother lovely green space where fields and woodland meet.¬† As with other areas we pass through it is easy to forget we are in London.\nKenley Airfield\nRAF Kenley was a main operating airfield from 1917 to 1959.¬† It saw heavy use during both World Wars.¬† Sadly, few buildings remain and the Control Tower itself was demolished following fire in 1978.¬† That said it is thought to be one of the best preserved Second World War RAF fighter stations.¬† Some land has been used for housing but the site is still active.¬† The RAF 2 Flying Training School are still an active presence.¬†Due to this the site falls under the Ministry of Defence.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon‚Äôt Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can attend.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we‚Äôd love to see you. Please message me if you have any questions.\nLooking For More:\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of other walks taking place in the South East.\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of provisional upcoming events in the ODL diary.\n(All photos taken by the leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "If you have ever joined OutdoorLads for our Penpont Canoeing activity you will have visited Glasbury on Wye, but Christmas gives us a chance to explore the village and surrounding countryside, and it will probably be a bit cold for the canoeing at this time of year!\nThe Brecon Beacons are a short drive away, so hopefully we can arrange car sharing for those that prefer a more mountainous walk, or perhaps a more leisurely walk taking in Three Cocks (The village of). ¬†For the cyclists amongst you there is the challenging Gospel Pass Loop, or as Glasbury is located a whole 5 miles away from Hay on Wye ¬†you may prefer a visit to the many bookshops there.\nThe Accommodation\nThis is our first visit to this location, but you can expect dormitory style accommodation with some spare beds available allowing us to spread-out throughout the building, and with a bit of OutdoorLads festive magic, we'll soon have the common areas looking like Santa's Grotto!\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect if this is your first OutdoorLads Christmas event.\nFriday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday, and find the bed you've reserved (more details on this closer to the time). Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge, with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be jacket potatoes with a choice of fillings, but we're not completely forgetting the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. We'd like you to bring along something for desert or an offering for a cheese board to be set out on both evenings.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge, or perhaps enjoy some board games (don't forget to bring your favourites).\nSaturday\nAfter breakfast on Saturday morning you'll head out on your choice of activity (we'll list these out below as they are confirmed), returning to our accommodation early afternoon. This means you will likely need a packed lunch that you will need to bring yourself.\nFor those of you that like your ParkRun on a Saturday morning, the nearest is Hay on Wye and we'll try to arrange drivers for those that need it and time our daytime activities to give you a chance to do both.\nOutdoorLads hostel events always rely on everyone mucking in and helping in the kitchen over the weekend and Christmas is no different, so whilst a few volunteers are busy in the kitchen, we'll hopefully have some Christmas themed activities in the lounge including our traditional Secret Santa.\nIt wouldn't be a Christmas hostel without Christmas dinner. and you can expect a starter, traditional Christmas roast, vegan option and all the trimmings followed by dessert.\nWe'll need some volunteers to clear up in the kitchen and dining room, but once that's done it will be a chance to relax and digest, there could be some music on but I'm sure the board games will be in full swing again.\nSunday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nOur plan is to offer a short walk or cultural event on the Sunday for those that are not in a hurry to leave, but this is subject to volunteers stepping up to lead this for you!\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Registered assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nCar Sharing\nChristmas is the time for sharing, so if driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way. ¬† Why not add your details to the\ncar share pag\ne and we'll provide a Telegram Chat room nearer the time.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check out the South Wales and South West Calendar\nhere\n.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nIf you have not been to one of the London Climbing Centres you will need to pre-register\nHERE\n.¬†You only need to register once to use any of their 8 centres in London.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nFirst time boulderer?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before, the event leader can give you a short introduction to get you started and give a few a few pointers on technique. After which we will join in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre‚Äôs staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nExperienced boulderer?\nSimply register with the wall and turn up on the day!\nAs above, all attending the event must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible for your own safety and so should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering¬†events in the South East, so why not check out¬†what's coming up near you¬†here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "45",
    "Summary": "'Hurst' in a place name means 'wooded hill', and these wooded hills will be stocked with seasonal shrubs such as¬†holly, ivy, spruce and so forth. Starting by car or bus amid such woods¬†we'll ascend Woolbeding Common, pause to appreciate the panorama, and then descend to the valley of the River Rother and the spick-and-span timelessness of the town of Midhurst. Here we'll split up and have an hour and a bit to find places to look at and lunch at. At a set time we'll meet up to complete the walk, finding further quiet corners, fir tree forests and historic homes (chief among¬†them the imposing ruins of Cowdray House) and generally delighting in the Christmassy company of our fellow OutdoorLads.\nThe sights:\nHenley:\nA straggle of picturesque cottages and farms on the edge of Verdley Hill. There are superb views back to Blackdown Hill. The Duke of Cumberland Arms pub is C16.\nWoolbeding Common:\nOak, sweet chestnut, birch and rowan growing on the greensand¬†give way to bilberry, gorse and heather. These areas don't feel like Sussex but more like the edge of Dartmoor. Birdlife includes green and greater spotted woodpeckers and perhaps resident linnets and stonechats. The heath has always provided local people with heather to burn and now the\nNational Trust\nis cutting back birch trees to prevent forest taking over the¬†biodiverse heathland. There are superb views from the highest point across the Weald to the South Downs.\nWoolbeding:\nThe first village on the¬†River Rother west out of Midhurst. All Hallows Church is tall, unaisled, Saxon, but restoration has removed most character and the chancel is from 1870. Woolbeding Hall is a delightful house of 1700, with French-looking additions of 1875. Home from 1972 until his death in¬†2006 to businessman, philanthropist and art collector Simon Sainsbury, and later his civil partner Stewart Grimshaw. The National Trust opens the\ngardens\n. Woolbeding Bridge is C14. Kinetic Greenhouse (it opens like a flower), 2021, designed by Thomas Heatherwick to display plants from the Silk Road. Cedra, water sculpture by William Pye, 2011.\nMidhurst:\nTo quote my go-to¬†topographer Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n: 'To the main road traveller, Midhurst, like Petworth, is a bewildering series of acute ninety-degree bends combined with an inexplicable cottagey cosiness in the buildings, so different from the open market-places of Hampshire. Few towns are more deceptive, few towns withhold themselves so firmly until the traveller gets out of his car and on to his feet: few towns in particular have a more exciting relationship with the surrounding countryside'.¬†The parish church (St Mary Magdalene and St Denys) is disappointing: some parts are C13, but most seems to be from the restoration of 1882. It overlooks a pleasant if rather empty square. The Spread Eagle Hotel is 1700, the Old Market House is C16, Market¬†Hall (Now Eagle House) is 1552 with an C18 front. The former library is a ramble of tiled and timbered cottages¬†of the C17. The biggest building is Cowdray House, just NE of the town, the epitome of sober but splendid Tudor architecture,¬†dating from 1492 to 1542. It was¬†left a ruin by a fire in 1793 and so spared from being Victorianized.\nEasebourne:\nA Cowdray Estate village (identified by yellow paintwork), mostly sandstone with some timber framing. Many good C19 estate cottages. Sycamore Cottage is C16 and the best of a mile of cottages that stretches up the village's High Street. St Mary is a priory church from the C13, but almost everything is now of 1876. Easebourne Priory was founded in 1238 and what is left are the buildings around the cloister which now form an amalgam of medieval, C17 and C18 design.\nThe\nroute\n(please click on the link in red to be taken to the Ordnance Survey website):\nThe westwards Serpent Trail will take us along Verdley Edge to the highest point of Woolbeding Common. Paths heading south will bring us to Eastshaw Lane which will bring us to Woolbeding village. Heading further south over the bridge, we'll almost get to the A272 and the western edge of Midhurst. After an hour exploring the town and finding food and a place to eat it, we'll meet up again, ascend St Anne's Hill, then proceed along the River Rother past Cowdray. A gravel track in the grounds of the house will take us to Easebourne where we'll walk along the High Street, then Easebourne Street north to Whitters Copse. At Verdley Farm we'll pick up a footpath heading west back to Henley.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, except that there will be a number of stiles to cross (you may have to lift your muddy beast over them), lanes to walk along, a few fields with livestock and the town of Midhurst where they might not be welcome in caf√©s (although being Sussex, they probably will).¬†Any dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly &¬†confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you‚Äôve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there‚Äôs plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n-¬†Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power.¬†With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it‚Äôs excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The¬†bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n¬£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n¬£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n¬£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n¬£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n¬£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n¬£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Whether on¬†the neolithic Dorset Cursus, the Roman Ackling Dyke or¬†the modern A354, people have crossed this comely corner of Dorset for centuries. But they have also known the value of lingering¬†in this lovely locale, whether for a lifetime in the timber-framed cottages and stone-built mansions that outnumber the modern houses, or¬†for eternity in the burial mounds that are as thick as the winter wheat. Our crossing and lingering will last just six hours as we complete this enjoyable jaunt, planned at the sweet spot where a¬†fertile vale of sandy clay meets an expansive plateau of chalk.\nThe plateau¬†is Cranborne Chase, which the route will touch on. The sixth largest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the country, and at the meeting point of Salisbury Plain, the West Wiltshire Downs and the Dorset Downs. Chalk is the predominant geology and chalk downland the predominant ecology, but the Chase has much variety.\nThe downs are named after the¬†village of Cranborne, founded by the Saxons, which had a¬†manor house¬†and a small¬†monastery. The word 'chase'¬†comes from the¬†hunts, undertaken¬†by royalty (including Kings¬†John,¬†Henry VIII¬†and¬†James I), which took place on the downs. The Manor House is mostly Jacobean, rebuilt by Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, minister under James I, as a hunting lodge. A later inhabitant was Viscount Cranborne, former Conservative leader of the House of Lords. The church of St¬†Mary and St Bartholomew is large, 12th century originally, now mostly 13th to 15th centuries with a massive 15th century tower and 14th century wall-paintings.\nThe archaeology in this area is prodigious. Wor Barrow is a large¬†neolithic (\n3500-2500\nBCE) long barrow, excavated by the pioneer of scientific British field archaeology, Sir Augustus Pitt-Rivers in 1893-4.¬†Ackling Dyke is the Roman Road from Dorchester to Old Sarum and the most impressive and best-preserved stretch of Roman road in Southern Britain. The agger (embankment) is over 2 metres high in places and the width is over 15 metres. It crosses the Dorset Cursus (a neolithic processional path¬†associated with ancestor-worship) near the route of the walk. There are almost a hundred barrows (bowl, bell and disc) dotted all around, dating from the neolithic to the bronze age (1500-800BCE).\nAnd what of the sixpenny¬†of the title? It is the village of Sixpenny Handley, known as just Handley until the mid-19th century, a pretty place with a mostly Victorian church (St Mary, 1877) and some handsome houses amid all the archaeology.\nThe\nroute\nstarts at The Square in Cranborne and then heads southwest along the Jubilee Trail past the Manor House and out to Creech Hill House. The trail then proceeds along Ringwood Lane to Wimborne Up Monkton and then veers west then northwest along Harley Down, past numerous barrows and crossing¬†the Cursus and then northwest past Chapel Down Farm and then northeast to Sixpenny Handley. Leaving the village in a northerly direction and then an easterly direction we'll join the Hardy Way, cross Oakley Down and see Wor Barrow. Then, having crossed the A354 and Ackling Dyke we'll head southeast to cross Blackbush Down and admire Toby's Bottom. Then, turning south, we'll head towards Cranborne to complete the walk.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:¬†Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre‚Äôs staff.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nJoin me for an autumnal hike enjoying the last day of British Summer Time!!!\nSandwiched between the M4 and M40 corridor, adjacent to the urban sprawl of West London and the much maligned Slough is a green oasis of protected ancient woodland and heathland. This 10 mile circular hike the knits together the best of this area to include Burnham Beeches, Egypt Woods and Stoke Common whilst passing through the pretty villages of Hedgerley and Fulmer. I have timed it to hopefully showcase some early autumn colours whilst we walk past beech trees, heather and silver birch.\nA summary of some of the sights:\nBurnham Beeches:\nis a scenic nature reserve and ancient woodland covering 220 acres and known for its impressive beech trees, some over 400 years old. The area is a\nSite of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to its rare habitats and biodiversity. The City Of London Corporation has been responsible for Burnham Beeches since 1880 when it purchased the land to protect it from urban development and ensure its preservation for future generations. Due to its proximity to Pinewood Studios it is often used as a filming location and has been used in many films to include Harry Potter, Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves and Goldfinger.\nHedgerley:\nis a small, picturesque village, with Medieval origins, and often features in the Bucks best kept village awards. It features traditional brick and flint cottages and a historic parish church (St. Mary the Virgin). Notably the village was known was the source of high quality bricks, to include those used by Brunel for the construction of the Great Western Railway, which for example were used for Box Tunnel near Bath.\nFulmer:\nis another small village, often vying with Hedgerley for Bucks best kept village. The name \"Fulmer\" is thought to derive from Old English, meaning \"foul mere\" or \"lake frequented by birds,\" likely referring to the nearby water features and wetlands. I will plan a drink stop at the Black Horse which dates back to the 1600's.\nStoke Common\n: is a rare and ecologically significant area of heathland covering 205 acres and is one of the last remaining areas of lowland heath in Bucks. Similarly owned and managed by the City of London Corporation, Stoke Common is also designated as a SSSI due to its rich biodiversity. The area supports a range of wildlife, including rare insects, reptiles, and ground-nesting birds, as well as heather, gorse, and birch scrub.\nThe route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Burnham Beeches we will firstly take a tour via some of the paths of the nature reserve to include wetlands, ponds and a mix of trees. From the nature reserve we will continue through woodland via the Portman Burtley Estate through Nine Acre and Whitespark woods. We pass Pennlands Farm which had a brickworks until 1936.\nWe will stop at the village of Hedgerley for an early lunch stop and optional visit to the notable Church. From Hedgerley we continue onto the village of Fulmer via Church Wood and Colley Hill, and at this point the M40 becomes visible with the inevitable background chorus of traffic noise.\nWe will make our second stop in Fulmer with a drink at Black Horse. From Fulmer we walk through Stoke Common nature reserve and Farnham Common and eventually arrive back at Burnham Beeches.\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are minimal stiles on route but a few road sections and crossings where they will need to be on a lead. Dogs need to be on a lead whilst we are in the Burnham Beeches nature reserve. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember¬†not everyone loves¬†dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting.¬†What will¬†happen, who will be there, and what can you¬†expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This will be my first solo event after becoming a leader, so fingers crossed I've put together something interesting.\nWe'll start in Redhill and work our way up to the top of Reigate Hill. ¬†Once there we will continue along the ridge before dropping back down to pleasant heathland. ¬†It will then be a mixture of scenery and hopefully lovely autumn colours. ¬†Every step of the way we will be presented with history and interesting features.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nWe start at Redhill station and soon leave behind shops and then housing to climb to the top of Reigate Hill. ¬†On route we pass Wray Common windmill, constructed in 1824. ¬†It long ceased to be a working mill and is now a private residence. ¬†At the top of Reigate Hill we'll pass some of the main TV/radio/mobile transmitters for the area and also Reigate Fort. ¬†This fort was built in the late 1890s to offer protection from foreign invasion. ¬†Despite the reputation of the British Navy, at this time confidence was low in the navy being able to withstand enemy attacks. ¬†Further along we are greeted by a touching memorial to the nine airman killed, when tragically their plane crashed during bad weather in 1945. ¬†As we continue along the ridge we are offered stunning views of the area. ¬†Any noise from the M25, only a stone throw away, seems cancelled out by a green canopy.\nA sometimes steep climb down from the hill takes us down to heathland. ¬†We will stop for lunch here before seeing Reigate Heath Windmill. ¬†A beautifully maintained mill built in 1765 it is now a place of worship. ¬†In fact it is thought to be the only windmill converted to a church in the world! ¬†Moving on from the windmill we'll grab a drink at the Skimmington Castle.\nSlowly winding our way back we leave heathland and move into more wooded and farmland areas. ¬†We'll eventually reach Reigate Priory Park. ¬†The first sight well see will be Priory Pond. ¬†This lovely oasis was originally used by monks when the area contained a monastery. ¬†Moving through the park we'll then reach Reigate Priory. ¬†This stunning building and site, nearly 800 years old, was once the monastery. ¬†The dissolution of the monasteries put an end to the religious use of the site. ¬†It then became a home passing through various families. ¬†There are links to King Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, and King Edward VII. ¬†Now a school its future use is uncertain as the school is due to the leave the site for modern facilities.\nAfter leaving the park we start to move through suburbia winding our way back to Redhill station. ¬†Here the walk will finish, but people are welcome to grab a drink before setting off home.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks.

    "Summary": "On this circular riverside walk through Wapping, the Isle of Dogs, Greenwich, Rotherhithe and Bermondsey, we'll admire the feats of engineering and infrastructure that made London Docklands the busiest port in the world. We‚Äôll trace the wood-built wharves, weathered warehouses, and winding waterways that once buzzed with tea and tobacco, coffee and cocoa, sugar and spice. We‚Äôll enjoy the crisp air and festive cheer, with twinkling lights reflecting off the Thames. We‚Äôll cross under the river via the Greenwich Foot Tunnel, and perhaps explore the Brunel Museum‚Äôs vault ('the eighth wonder of the world'). We‚Äôll hug and huddle, celebrate history and heritage, and look ahead to the holiday.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll start our walk at...\n1. Tower Hill Underground Station:\nFunctional Victorian design; simple brick fa√ßade, understated compared to nearby Tower of London. The station sits above Roman-era city walls.\nWe'll then head east along Tower Hill and St Katherine‚Äôs Way to...\n2. Dickens Inn, St Katherine Docks:\nReconstructed C18 timber-framed pub. It wasn‚Äôt originally located here, being relocated from Shad Thames.\nGoing east along St Katharine‚Äôs Way to the dock entrance, we'll reach...\n3. St Katherine Docks:\nGeorgian warehouses converted into luxury marina housing. Noted for harmony of classical proportions with functional dock design. One of London‚Äôs first fully enclosed docks (1828).\nWe‚Äôll walk northeast along St Katharine‚Äôs Way to the...\n4. Hermitage Wall:\nMedieval defensive wall fragment. Architecturally unremarkable, but historically significant as a rare surviving City fortification.\nThen we'll use the Thames Path heading east through Wapping to...\n5. Wapping Pier Head:\nIndustrial brick quay with iron fittings. Utilitarian aesthetic, little ornamentation but very elegant. The pier marks the former Wapping Basin entrance to the Thames. Used as a filming location in the Doctor Who story\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977), where the villain's henchman Chang searches for his master's Time Cabinet in the foggy London streets.\nGoing east along Wapping High Street, we'll get to...\n6. Wapping Old Stairs: C17\nriver steps. Narrow, picturesque, evocative of historic river commerce. Once a notorious smuggling spot. Used as a filming location in\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977) where an old crone leads the police to a mutilated body floating in the river, exclaiming: \"On my oath! You wouldn‚Äôt want that served with onions! Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Ugh! Make an 'orse sick, that would!\"\nHeading north along Wapping Lane, we'll find...\n7. Wapping Woods:\nA small green space amid former industrial land.\nWe‚Äôll walk east along Wapping Lane and Thomas More Street, following the Thames Path to...\n8.\nTobacco Dock:\nAn 1811 warehouse designed by John Rennie the Elder whose use of brick and iron was praised for its elegance and durability. Later event-space conversions sometimes clash with its original proportions. Originally for imported tobacco, one of London‚Äôs largest bonded warehouses.\nGoing east along Wapping Lane and Narrow Street, we'll continue on the Thames Path through Shadwell to...\n9.\nShadwell Basin:\nC19 dock basin with simple brick warehouses. Now residential.\nWe‚Äôll then walk north along Wapping Wall, following the Thames Path to...\n10. Prospect of Whitby:\nEvocative C16 riverside tavern with timber beams and low ceilings. Once frequented by sailors and smugglers.\nHeading north along Wapping Wall, we'll reach...\n11. Wapping Hydraulic Power Station:\nBrick and iron industrial structure, built 1890. Supplied hydraulic power to London docks originally by coal and steam, then by electricity. Exterior now overshadowed by surrounding modern developments.\nGoing east along Wapping Wall, using the Thames Path, we'll reach...\n12. The Grapes:\nEarly C18 riverside pub; elegant Georgian frontage. Charles Dickens referenced it in\nOur Mutual Friend.\nWe‚Äôll walk east along Wapping Lane, Limehouse Link, and Aspen Way, following the Thames Path near the dock edges to reach...\n13. West India Docks:\nEarly C19 dock complex; William Jessop‚Äôs engineering praised for functionality. Major hub for Caribbean sugar and rum trade. Plain but elegant warehouses contrast sharply with nearby modern Canary Wharf.\nHeading northeast within West India Docks. we'll get to...\n14. Brown's Building:\nFormer warehouse with red brick and steel. Adaptive reuse for offices preserves industrial feel.\nGoing north along Hertsmere Road is the location of the...\n15. Museum of London Docklands:\n1802 sugar warehouse with John Rennie‚Äôs brickwork praised for its proportion. Preserves Docklands history and is converted sensitively.\nWe‚Äôll walk east along Hertsmere Road and West India Avenue into...\n16. Canary Wharf:\nA landmark postmodern financial district masterplanned by C√©sar Pelli and Norman Foster in the late 1980s. Towering skyscrapers, including One Canada Square (235‚ÄØm, 1991) and HSBC Tower (200‚ÄØm, 1990). The glass-and-steel fa√ßades convey sleek modernity. Elevated plazas, public art, and interconnected pedestrian routes offer civic spaces, yet some feel the uniformity prioritizes corporate aesthetics over human-scale warmth.\nHeading adjacent to Canary Wharf we'll get to...\n17. West India Quay:\nC19 warehouses. Preserved dockside character amidst modern commercial redevelopment.\nGoing southeast along Aspen Way and Millwall Dock we'll reach....\n18. Millwall Docks:\nFunctional C19 dock basin. Now residential; retains water and quay walls. Warehouses‚Äô architectural charm largely lost in redevelopment.\nWe‚Äôll walk southeast along Manchester Road and Tunnel Approach, heading to Greenwich through the...\n19. Greenwich Foot Tunnel:\nEdwardian cast-iron pedestrian tunnel designed by Maurice Fitzmaurice. The elegant tiled interior seems narrow and constraining, but still a great engineering achievement.\nWe'll emerge from the tunnel to see the...\n20. Cutty Sark:\nAn 1869 clipper designed by Hercules Linton. Fastest tea clipper of its era. Sitting in a purpose-built dry dock which is partially successful: it preserves the ship for public viewing offering tourist-friendly walkways and interpretive spaces.

    "Summary": "Making mountains out of molehills: an autumnal circular walk with 500m of ascent through the Chiltern ‚Äòmountains‚Äô and the ‚Äòpeaks‚Äô of Hertfordshire & Buckinghamshire\nFull disclosure: There are no mountains in Hertfordshire or the Home Counties. However, this circuit route will take us up and down the chalk hills of the Chilterns, with a total ascent of over 500m.\nThe route is approximately 18km and initially takes us up along the Ridgeway, passing Grim's Ditch‚Äîan ancient linear earthwork thought to date back to the Iron Age. Shortly after, we will cross into Buckinghamshire, and our second climb will bring us up to Ivinghoe Beacon, with views across the lowlands of the shires to the north. We will leave the Ridgeway and circle back towards the Ashridge Estate, enjoying the undulating landscape (climbing more hills).\nWe will cross back into Hertfordshire and arrive at the Bridgewater Monument, where one can add an additional 33m of height by climbing the spiral stairs of the tower‚Äîif it is open and for a modest payment to the National Trust. Alternative options include cake and coffee at the caf√©.\nWe will then drop down to the village of Aldbury, known for its \"olde worlde\" charm, before the final ascent of Tom's Hill.\nAll the ridges add up to 500m of ascent, and so this walk qualifies as an entry in the 'SE500' series of walks; if you attend you'll improve your fitness and burn 2100 calories in the process. This walk will be fairly challenging, but we'll take it at a sensible pace and in manageable stages and we'll do each rise with plenty of time to have rests.\nThis is an Autumnal/Winter hike.\nIce axes and crampons will not be needed for the mountains of Hertfordshire however good shoes and suitable winter clothing are recommended. ¬† The route involves rolling hills, ridges and fields and is suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. There will be mud so make sure you are prepared to maybe get a little muddy and potentially a little wet.\nDon't waste that space!\nIf your plans change and your unable to make the event, please cancel your attendance so that others get the opportunity to sign up and make travel plans.\nIs it¬†dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) Pick up the Poo and dispose of the baggies responsibly. ¬† Please also remember¬†not everyone loves¬†dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event.¬†If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader¬†with permission for ODL use.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement, here\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A circular¬†walk being approx 9.5 miles (15.3 kms) of mainly flat terrain.¬†¬†It's a nice mix of¬†some proper rural countryside paths, some alongside the river and across¬†fields,¬†together¬†with¬†walking through attractive¬†villages packed with pretty listed building to fill your camera roll with!\nWaitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are often likely to get one.\nWe will start our circular walk in the¬†village of Kelvedon, an old Essex village on the mainline railway (services from London Liverpool St). From here we ¬†walk across countryside to the very pretty small market town of Coggeshall. Our route to Coggeshall will take us past a lovely grade 1 Listed Mill (now a residence) and the remains of Coggeshall Abbey - originally an English Cistercian monastery founded in 1140.\nCoggeshall¬†is a bit of a hidden historical gem in North Essex. It also has a reputation for being one of the most haunted towns in the UK and more than its fair share of murders! This is not least due apparently to it being at the crossing of ley lines, supposed beams of energy linked to the earths magnetic pull, creating \"friction\"\nA¬†local market has been in existence here since 1256 and there are¬†an abundance of lovely period buildings (300 listed ones apparently).\nThese¬†include¬†2 small but lovely National Trust sites: Paycockes House (the heavily timbered & herringbone brick house in the images) and the medieval Grange Barn (shown also) which is apparently the oldest surviving timber framed barn in the UK.\nWe will visit both these with the chance, if you wish, to also look inside each (*please see inside entry fees info below).\nThere will be time for a packed lunch stop in the grounds of the barn followed by the chance of some well earned coffee and cake at the Paycockes House site cafe.\nOnce¬†refueled we will head out of Coggeshall on our way back to Kelvedon. Our route will help burn off that cake,¬†taking¬†us across a couple of fields (which can at certain times be quite deeply ploughed - you have been warned!) and along some quiet country lanes. We will take in the pretty village green of Feering before returning to some¬†more built up¬†area for the last mile or so back into¬†Kelvedon.¬†¬†Here there are a couple of Pubs we can chose from for finishing an outdoor lads walk in the traditional way with a pint or two.\n*National Trust Sites Entry Fees. There is an entry fee per person of ¬£11.00 for Paycocks House and ¬£6.00 for Grange Barn which you'll need to pay on the day if you're not a National Trust member. There is no pressure to actually go inside of course - but if you don't, please be prepared to wait around a little for those who do.\nIs it¬†dog friendly?\nYes!!¬† 4 legged friends are welcome but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note there are a couple of styles and a couple of potentially fairly deeply ploughed fields to cross. You would also not be able to take your pooch into Paycocks House or the Tea Room there (there is however outdoor seating in the gardens there) . Please remember¬†not everyone loves¬†dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members -¬†I would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

    "Summary": "This event will open for booking on Thursday 25th September at 7pm. ¬†The full price of the event is ¬£516 for full and concession members, and ¬£586 for PAYG members.\nDue to overwhelming interest in this event and in order to be as fair as possible to all those that wish to attend, we are having to implement a revised booking system for this event. No pre-bookings will now be taken for the event, except for the event leader. When the event opens on Thursday 25th September at 7pm, it will be via this event page and will require payment of ¬£103.20 (20% of the full member price) as a deposit. Those that sign up will be sent an invoice for the remaining balance (¬£412.80 for full members) to pay via bank transfer, credit / debit card, or you can arrange to pay the remainder in instalments. Payment, or an plan for instalments, must be made by 27th October 2025 or your place will be considered cancelled. The full balance must be paid by 1st June 2026.\nFrom Friday 26th September, this event page will revert to showing the full price so people can book on and pay in the usual way, but we will also accept people contacting the office to ask to pay in instalments.\nSpend a week in the beautiful hills outside Rome and #getoutmore in Italy! ¬†After almost 9 years, ODL returns to this beautiful 1,600 year old monastery 45 minutes northeast of Rome. ¬†Fully modernised and capable of accommodating 12 guests, this building will be our base for a week of hiking and cultural immersion in the Lazio region.\nThis is a week away in Italy where the focus will be on getting out more and exploring the area on foot, enjoying the views and sights and the company of fellow OutdoorLads members; and a chance to enjoy the culture and tourist sights of Italy, too, rather than a chill-out holiday. So come and enjoy fantastic break away with us and get acquainted with this beautiful region!\nOur accommodation at the monastery features four twin-bedded rooms, and two double rooms (if you are coming as a couple or friends who don't mind sharing, please let the leader know!) and a full kitchen. Simple breakfasts, and tea and coffee are provided all week, as are two group evening meals. For the other evening meals you can self-cater, eat out, or those that wish to can shop, cook at eat together as a group - we can make arrangements for that when we arrive.\nNo transport is included, you will need to book and pay for all your own travel including flights and transport to the accommodation, and any transport whilst there. There is parking for four cars at the monastery if you wish to hire a car, but this would be at your own additional cost.\nItinerary and arrangements\nThe (adjustable) itinerary will look something like this. Please note that most tickets for attractions cannot be booked until at least 75 days in advance. ¬†You would need to book and pay for tickets for any of these yourself, they are not included in the price.\nFriday 24 July\nShould you arrive at the monastery before 16.00, you will need to wait in the courtyard as there will be no access into the building. ¬†I will meet the housekeeper at 16.00 and will need time to go through the preliminaries before allowing everyone in.\nThe train from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (Fiumicino Airport) to\nTivoli\ntakes around 2.5 hours, with a change required in Rome. Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around ‚Ç¨11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli. Make sure you do not book to Tivoli Terme, as that is 30 minutes before Tivoli itself.\nThere are no activities planned for today, other than a communal dinner buffet.\nSaturday 25 July\nPlan on an early start to enjoy this (slightly longer than) 8.15km\nGrotto delle sirene\nloop through the village of Tivoli. We will walk down to the village from the monastery to the \"official\" starting point. This route covers very gently rolling village streets and paths, with an elevation gain of 160 metres and a loss of 150 metres. ¬†Good trainers or walking shoes should should be adequate.\nLunch can either be brought from the monastery or can be purchased from one of the local shops. ¬†Alternatively a trattoria lunch can be arranged at the end of the walk, as we will be in the village.\nSunday 26 July\nAs this is the last Sunday of the month the Vatican Museums\nMIGHT\nbe free (at least they were in 2025). If we decide to do this, the last entry into the Museum is at 12.30 so we would plan on leaving the monastery early, to try and avoid the queues as much as possible. Please note that shorts are\nNOT\nallowed inside the Vatican.\nThe Sistine Chapel is included on the free day, St Peter's Basillica is also free to enter but there will be security queues.\nAdditionally, for those interested there may be the option of attending the\nSunday Angelus\nin St Peter's Square, starting at 12.30. Please note that this only takes place when the Pope is in residence at the Vatican. ¬†I will check the schedule as this day gets closer.\nFor those that prefer to stay at the monastery you will need to ensure that you have all your daily supplies as the shops and stores in Tivoli will most likely be closed today. There is the option of visiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are ‚Ç¨17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n, but cannot be booked until Spring 2026.\nDinner may be a cookout at the monastery or some restaurants may be open.\nMonday 27 July\nAnother early start will see us exploring this 11.5km\nPonte Nomentano\n\"linear\" loop along the Aniene River. This requires the use of public transport (50 minutes by bus each way) or private car to the start / end point and that will be advised upon during the event.\nThis walk is completely flat, along the banks of the Anien River. ¬†Good trainers or walking shoes should be adequate, but bear in mind there may be mud if there has been any rain. There are several restuarants / cafes at the 6km turn-around point that might work for lunch; we will just need to see what is open.\nTuesday 28 July\nToday will see us venturing into Rome to explore this ancient city. ¬†Independent options could include:\nRome \"hop on - hop off\" bus tour;\nTickets\nshould be purchased in advance, starting at ‚Ç¨26 per person.\nExplore the city on your own, taking in sites like Vatican City, the\nColosseum\n(multiple ticket options, starting from ‚Ç¨53) or the \"\nEat, Pray, Love\n\" movie\nfilming locations\ntour.\nExplore\nSt Peter's Basillica\n(free to enter but there will be long security queues)\nFor the foodies you can try and visit the 13 best\ngelaterias\nin Rome!\nExplore the\nJewish Ghetto\n, which actually dates back to 1555 when it was created by Pope Paul IV Carafa.\nBe the ultimate tourist and toss coins into the Trevi Fountain (one coin \"ensures\" your return to Rome, two coins increases your chances of finding true love in the near future, and three coins ensures coins 1 and 2, as well as ensuring marriage in the Eternal City - coins must be tossed over your right shoulder using your left hand), walk down the Spanish Steps, or stroll down the\nVia Condotti\n(Rome's luxury shopping street).\nPartake in any one of the free (only pay what you want)\nwalking tours\nof Rome.\nAs the streets are virtually all cobblestone, good, solid soled shoes are highly recommended. Dinner this evening will be a special event (paid individually), at a restaurant in Rome to be decided upon later.\nWednesday 29 July\nToday we venture \"uphill\" from the monastery, taking in this 12.8km\nSughereta di Sirividola\nloop. This hike starts just down the main road from the monastery so no transport is needed. This hike is mostly on mountain paths, with an elevation gain of 460 metres and a loss of 450 metres. ¬†Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nAnother option, if you so desire, could be returning to Rome to attend the free\nPapal Audience\nin St Peter's Square. ¬†Again this is obviously ties to the Holy Father's summer schedule.`\nDinner this evening can either be communal back at the monastery or at any of the local tavernas.\nThursday 30 July\nToday is our last full day in this incredible location so let's make the most of it! For those that are not too knackered from yesterday's hike, there is this 8.45km\nTivoli to Monte Catillo\nloop through the hills above Tivoli. This hike should be a bit less strenuous than yesterday's but still has an elevation gain of 330 metres, and a loss of the same. ¬†Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nFor those not interested in hiking today, cultural options include:\nVisiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are ‚Ç¨17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n. Please note that you cannot book tickets until Spring 2026.\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the village, following any one of these 3\nitineraries\n.\nCompletely spoil yourself at the\nAqua Albule\nthermal spa, about 20 minutes by train from Tivoli. Use of the pool is around ‚Ç¨17; full access to the thermal spa is around ‚Ç¨45 and includes use of the sauna, \"flavoured\" and \"sailing\" showers (don't ask as I have no idea!!!) and hydrotherapy. Please note that ODL accepts no responsibility for your use of these facilities. ¬†As always you should check with your GP to see if these services are right for you.\nDinner tonight will be a communal affair at the monastery, with a special \"theme\" to be announced early in the week.\nFriday 31 July\nSadly, our Roman adventure comes to an end today. ¬†We will need to check out of the monastery by 10.00am, before which we will do the traditional \"ODL hostel clean\".\nIf you are flying back to the UK today please try not to book your departing flight before 16.00, as it is at least 2 hours on the bus / train, including a change in Rome.\nIf you are staying on in Rome for any additional days, please do not book your transport from Tivoli before 11.00, in order for everyone to participate in the clean-up.\nRome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is served by virtually every major airport in the UK, using EasyJet, RyanAir, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling and WizzAir. ¬†Rome Ciampino Airport (approximately 1 hour south of Rome) is served by RyanAir (from Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and London Stansted - please note that flight days can vary).\nShould you wish to arrive in Rome before the 24th, or stay after the 31st, please note that all costs will be your own to incur and you will not be able to stay on longer at the monastery.\nIt is strongly recommended that you secure travel insurance to cover not only the hiking activities, but also flight delay or cancellation, baggage delays, medical care and, if necessary, repatriation.\nPay in instalments\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. This is how the event leader has chosen to pay - so it's no hardship.\nExamples of instalment options, but we're happy to discuss options with you:\nBook during October: Eight payments of ¬£64.50\nBook during November: Seven payments of ¬£73.72\nBook during December: Six payments of ¬£86.\nYou will need to have fully paid up by the start of June.\nPhotos:\nPhotos provided\nwww.unsplash.com\n, OutdoorLads members and the monastery and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for an evening of Indoor Bouldering¬†at Big Rock Bond in Milton Keynes!!\nIf you have not been to one of the Big Rock climbing centres you will need to pre-register\nHERE\n.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre‚Äôs staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before...\nAs above, everyone attending the event¬†must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible¬†for your own safety, actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nHow Do I Sign Up?\nIf you are not already registered with Big Rock, please do so\nHERE\n. As well as signing up to this OutdoorLads event page you¬†will need to pay Big Rock for a session. This can be done on the day of the event at entry. As before, we'd ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering¬†events in the South East, so why not check out¬†what's coming up near you¬†here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "Experience a magical world of Cotswold fairy-tale villages and a Christmas market! An idyllic start to the Christmas season.\nThis event is a day walk including a visit to the market. The walk starts and ends in the small town of Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, close to the border with Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. The town is full of historic yellow-stone buildings, some dating to the 1200s when a market became established. The Christmas market is open on this day only, with 60 little stalls selling hand-made wares and tasty treats. We will call by at the start and end of the walk. In the afternoon, music is planned led by the Cotswold Choir, and there is a light switch on.\nLeaving Moreton, we follow Monarch‚Äôs Way crossing farmland to the sleepy village of Longborough. This will be our lunch stop. You might be tempted in the little caf√© at the village store, awarded\nbest Village Shop\nin the South West 2025. The centuries-old\nCoach and horses\npub also provides food and there is a bench on the corner here, and another by the churchyard, if you bring a packed lunch.\nAfter Longborough, the walk takes the Heart of England Way passing\nSezincote\nHouse. This extraordinary Cotswold stone mansion was built by the Cockerell family, some of whom had been to India with the British East India Company in the late 1700s. The house resembles an Indian Mughal palace, and you can clearly see the domes from the path just outside.\nThe next village we walk through is Bourton-on-the-Hill. This is a picture-postcard Cotswold village with listed cottages and church. Just outside the village the way skirts around Batsford Arboretum, an estate including Japanese maples, magnolias and pines.\nThe walk then returns to Moreton-in-Marsh where you can choose how long you wish to enjoy the flavours of the market and hear the music, before your return train or drive home. A most pleasurable Cotswold experience to prepare for Christmas!\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "About 14.5 km (9 miles) with 263 metres total ascent.\nThis is a proper north London hill walk that includes wonderful views from Alexandra Palace, Highgate (near Muswell Hill), Parliament Hill, Kenwood House, Hampstead Heath, and Golders Hill Park.\nFrom Alexandra Palace station we begin with panoramic views of the metropolis from Alexandra Park before heading to higher point near Highgate Village, on the brink of Muswell Hill, for more spectacular views. Much of the walk is through woods or on rolling grassland with several famous views out across London. We follow the picturesque route of an old railway line, through the ancient Highgate Wood, Queen's Wood, and on to elegant Waterlow Park with a glimpse of Highgate Cemetery. From there we head to Hamstead Heath, one of London's most glorious green spaces, climb Parliament Hill, then on to Kenwood House via Highgate Ponds. From the hamlet of North End, the final flourish of the walk is the Hill Garden Pergola and Golders Hill Park before we arrive at Golders Green station.\nAlexandra Park\nwas laid out in 1863 on the site of the ancient Tottenham Wood, part of the Great Forest of Middlesex. In 1868 it incorporated a racecourse, open until until 1970, the only course within London.\nAlexandra Palace\nwas built as a theatre, entertainment venue and ice rink. By an Act of Parliament, in 1900 it become publicly owned. The site is most famous for its association with the BBC, and the iconic transmitter mast from 1935. After (another) serious fire in 1980 the building was reconstructed and reopened in 1988.\nThe southern flank of\nMuswell Hill\noffers spectular views of the City and beyond from the top of a 17-arch viaduct.\nThe\nParkland Walk\nfollows the course of the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway's branch line which opened in 1873 to connect Alexandra Palace with Finsbury Park. At 4km is now the longest linear nature reserve in London.\nTry not to think of the infomous serial killer, Dennis Nilsen, who lived on Cranley Gardens nearby before we head into\nHIghgate Wood\n.\nWaterlow Park\nis something of a hidden treasure where, beyond the gorgeous slopes of green, there are views over the City and, depending on tree cover, even the dome of St Paul's Cathedral.\nHampstead Heath\nowes much to the Common Protection Society, and the founder of the National Trust, Octavia Hill, who helped to raise funds for the public purchase of more land, as well as the Hampstead Heath Extension Act in 1888.\nParliament Hill\nis one of the finest viewpoints in London. Originally part of twelfth century Tottenhall Manor, it got its name during the English Civil War when it was occupied by Parliamentarian soldiers.\nHampstead Heath's\nHighgate Ponds\nare the source of the River Fleet, now hidden away in the sewers of north London and the City until it reaches the Thames at Blackfriars. The ponds include single-sex swimming ponds and the Model Boating Pond.\nKenwood House\nis a Palladian masterpiece created by the renowned architect Robert Adam from 1754. In 1922 the house and its contents were auctioned. The (Lord) Iveagh Bequest Act of 1929 stipulated that Kenwood and its contents should be open to the public, free of charge.\nFormer Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder lived at\nNorth End\nbetween 1708 and 1788, and it is the location of The Old Bull and Bush pub, immortalised in the famous music hall song by Florrie Ford in 1904.\nHill Garden and Pergola\nhas been recently restored to embody the opulent spirit of the Edwardian Age. It was built by Lord Leverhulme who made his fortune from Lever Brothers. There are great views from here.\nGolders Hill Park\nis lush, green and undulating. A popular place, it boasts formal gardens, a deer enclosure, children's play area and zoo. The final view point of the walk is the top terrace and cafe.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date. If you will not attend, please\ncancel your attendance\nas soon as possible beforehand to allow someone else to take your place.\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

The beck offers a tranquil start, with mossy bridges and shaded paths leading you toward the open fields above Baildon. As we ascend, stunning views are revealed across the Airedale valley and the landscape shifts from urban fringe to rolling countryside.\nFrom Baildon, the route continues through quiet lanes into Eldwick, passing stone cottages and the edge of Shipley Glen. The climb onto Burley Moor marks a dramatic change‚Äîheather and gritstone dominate, and the wind carries the scent of peat, bracken and wild heathers in bloom. The path leads to the Twelve Apostles, a Bronze Age stone circle perched high on the moor, offering sweeping views across Wharfedale and beyond.\nCrossing the moor, we'll reach Cragg Top, a large pictureque farmstead nestled on the edge of the uplands. The descent into Burley-in-Wharfedale is gentle and scenic, winding through wooded tracks and grassy lanes. The village welcomes you with its stone buildings and a sense of calm, marking the end of a richly varied and rewarding walk.\nThis route blends natural beauty, ancient history, and rural charm‚Äîperfect for those seeking solitude, inspiration, or simply a good stretch of the legs.\nWe'll take the Bradford bound train back from Burley-in-Wharfedale to our starting point in Shipley (¬£4.30 for a single ticket).

The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey\n- Sat 13 December 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley - 16 km (10 miles)\nThe Tower House, built in ¬†1715 as a corn mill, was once th home of former Health Minister Edwina Currie whilst MP for South Derbyshire. The sails are gone.\nThe modern A38 trunk route follows the line of the Roman 'Ryknild Street' which is a branch of Fosse Way running from Boughton-on-the-Water in the Cotswolds to Templeborough (Rotherham) via the Fort of 'Little Chester' in Derventio (Derby).\nThe Toyota Factory is built on the former estate of\nBurnaston\nHall, purchased by Derby Corporation in early 1930's to build Derby Airport. During WWII it was a USAAF base and post-war became home of \"Derby Aviation\", the forerunner of British Midland Airways and bmibaby. The inadequacy of the grass-strip landing field and increase in civial aviation precipitated the construction of East Midlands Airport on the former RAF WWII Castle Donington Aerodrome which opened in 1964.\nThe Parish Church of St. Hellen contains the tomb of Sir John Port, founder of Repton School and also the adjacent Port Hospital Almshouses here the magnificent wrought iron gates by Robert Bakewell of Derby are now preserved. They originally stood at the entrance to Etwall Hall. Well-dressing was revived in 1970 and takes place annually in the middle of May. Public Houses serviing refreshments are the 'Hawk and Buckle' and the 'Spread Eagle'.\nReturn bus service (V1/V2) to Derby available from Etwall.\nThe Early English 'All Saints' Church largely dates from 13th century but contains 12th century stained glass of St. Michael, reputedly the oldest example in the country. The porch stonework shows evidence of arrow sharpening dating from the time of compulsory archery practice on Sundays.\nA new community grew near to here, at Lees, after\nDalbury\nwas abandoned during the time of The Black Death in the 14th century. A short detour into the village will lead you to the 'Black Cow' on the Green.\nAt Langley Common, the Roman Road of 'Long Lane', between the forts of Rocester and Little Chester, passes near to the 'Blue Bell Inn'.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

In the daytime there are guided groups that you can join for skiing or snowboarding where you will meet lots of other gay guys, and rendezvous restaurants where multiple groups meet for lunch. In the evening there are parties every nite some are themed (fancy dress) and are great fun. In between there is apres ski at the end of the day and the spa (if you have access) .\nFor more info:-\nEuropean Snow Pride website\n.\nEuropean Snow Pride on facebook\n.\nPLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO EUROPEAN SKIING EVENTS THIS ONE, (EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE ESP) AND EUROPEAN GAY SKI WEEK¬† EGSW SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNING UP TO THE ONE YOU WANT TO ATTEND , ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE BOOKED ON ONE. THIS EVENT IS FOR EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE in TIGNES\nThere is a WhatsApp group to assist people in communicating to book / share accommodation and to communicate and arrange to meet up whilst there.¬†See the link in the location information below to join.\nPlease read the info on here carefully and on the ESP website, feel free to ask questions on the comments section below or in the whatsapp group.\nACCOMMODATION\nThere are lots of options see the\nEuropean Snow Pride website\nfor details.\nWhen booking for accommodation is open. I recommend booking ASAP¬†as the best accommodation offers sell out early and¬†the cost increases a little every month !\nThere are standard accommodation options that are eligible for the¬†outdoorlads discount (\n‚Ç¨35 pp for non special offer accom booked with an Event Pass+6 day lift pass see\nODL Discount\n.), and there are the special offer accoms ranging from approx ¬£400 to ¬£700 these are already really good value so they are not discounted.\nYou will need to pay 25% on booking and the remainder 1 month before the event.\nI will be booking the¬†deluxe special offer (¬£764pp (increases monthly)), a lot of the outdoorlads book this as is really good value and it makes shareing with other outdoorlads simple. The apartments are great, it is close to the slopes and it has access to the fantastic spa. This includes both event and¬†lift passes. So just flights, transfers and spending money on top.\nThe apartments are for 5 people but you don't need to arrange who you are sharing with till later so I recommend booking to secure a place as this will sell out. (There are lots of other options and the non special offer accom is eligible for discount). If you are on a tight budget the standard special is great value at ¬£500.\nIf you have got your own group together then great , if not message on the WhatsApp group , see link in the location information below to join the group, ask if any¬†other outdoorlads are looking to share. With the special offer accom , snowpride will allocate you an apartment with others you request to share with and/or will fill spaces with others on snowpride. I have shared with others i didn't know in the past and found it a¬†great way to make new friends.\nSKIING/SNOWBOARDING\nThere are daily guided groups for intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders and ski school available for beginners. This year each guided group will be accompanied by an ESP promoter and a professional ski guide from evolution 2.\nEuropean Snow Pride Ski options\n.\nYou can hire¬† your equipment¬† from ESP also.\nEVENT PASS ETC\nTo participate in the ski groups, a client must either purchase¬†an Event Pass Premium, or an Event Pass Standard plus a supplement for ski and snowboard groups.\nThe standard¬†includes the evening parties but not the daytime guided ski groups or the pool party.\nThis makes it more flexible¬†so that if you do not use the guided ski groups or go to the pool party it will be cheaper for you. You can add the pool party or the guided groups to the Standard pass as an optional extra.\nIf you are intending to do the guided ski groups and pool party then it is more cost effective to get the premium.\nFull details on the types¬†of event pass here;:\nhttps://www.europeansnowpride.com/fr/pass-evenement-gay-ski-week/\nGETTING THERE\nYou need to organise your own transport .\nSee\nEuropean Snow Pride travel¬†options\n.\nWhen booking flights to the resort the transfers usually leave the airports before 3pm on Saturday and are not likely to arrive back at the airport until after 3pm on the return journey. So please bear this in mind when booking flights. (As in,¬†early flight on arrival and late flight on return. There have been many occasions with a¬†late return transfer as Saturday is change over day for the whole of the french alps! The traffic is usually extremely congested, do not be misled by google travel times that are not for Saturday! Several people have missed flights booked too early in the day.)\n(ESP photos copyright¬†Franck Weens\nwww.weens.fr\nand Andr√©a Emmanuelli - Lezak\nwww.andrew-grey.com\nand European Snow Pride)",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads For An Evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at Rockover in Manchester!\nThis event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing.\nBouldering offers a wide range of benefits, including:\nPhysical:\nImproved strength, tone, balance, power, and coordination.\nMental:\nEnhanced problem-solving, focus, concentration, and body awareness.\nEmotional:\nRelaxation, a sense of achievement, and a feeling of mind-body connection.\nBouldering is also a fantastic way to meet new people and build lasting friendships, as it's an inherently social sport where climbers share tips and strategies to conquer the routes.\nNew to Bouldering?\nIf you're new to bouldering, it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader to learn the basics of safe bouldering. The leader can then introduce you to the rest of the group where you can refine your newly learnt skills in a social environment.\nExperienced Boulderer?\nIf you‚Äôre new to climbing with ODL, the leader will help to introduce you to the rest of the group so you can explore the centre together.\nYou are responsible for your own safety and actions while bouldering. Please use your own judgement when accepting advice from OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers, regardless of your bouldering experience.\nReady to boulder?\nYou will need to sign up on the ODL event page.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved, you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. If you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you through this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nAbsolutely!\nFor bouldering there is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help to show you around and give you tips on bouldering techniques\nFor rope climbing, we welcome all abilities however before you are able to climb at the centre unsupervised, you will need to pass the centre's climbing test. Our leader will be happy to offer you a supervised climbing session in which you will have the opportunity to do some rope climbing, as well as to learn some rope and belay technique to help you on your way to passing the centre's test.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

This is a totally uniqie venue, quirky, arty and has a good cocktail menu. There are many tables here so there should be seats available at this earlier time.\nThen a hike down to the Town Wall in Pink Lane. This is a popular meet up spot, a larger bar area in the centre and tables in many side rooms with a traditional feel and a great selection of ales.\nAfter a drink here we will head to the Bridge Tavern. Tucked underneath the Tyne Bridge. This has a long bar on the groundfloor with a terrace with patio heaters above. This venue offers a huge selection of drinks, plays great music and has a very much friendly welcoming vibe. ¬†Please note this is the one at the bottom of Dene Street and not to be mixed up with Bridge Hotel. This has a microbrewery on site so try a new very locally brewed pint.\nOnward we move a short distance to where we can get pie, peas and mash at Redhouse. You pay at bar, the food is superb stodge and it means no one has to divide the bill or pay a deposit. The pub is traditional, dark wood, exposed beams, a frontage that nods to the history.\nIf you prefer there is Sambucas over the road for pizza.\nWe can then go to The Dubliner nearby for live music.\nAfter that the scene is a short trek away for those that want to end the night there.\nFor anyone staying in the area longer there is a short leisure walk on the Sunday starting at Whitley Bay\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/whitley-wander-tynemouth-easy-laid-b‚Ä¶\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photograph images on this page were provided by the leader Steve and permission is kindly given for OutdoorLads to use.",

    "Summary": "I sometimes have more than thirty attendees on my walks, but I will limit the numbers on this walk to thirty to make it manageable in a busy urban setting. If you're among the first few on the wait list, you should still get a place once folk start cancelling.\nWith 2000 years of history (sextons found Roman remains digging graves in St George's Cemetery), five centuries of architectural innovation, around ten architectural styles, and a reputation for radical, intellectual, affluential and regal characters, Bloomsbury is a fascinating area in London's West End. The architectural diversity has jeopardised the area's essential character, with modern and brutalist designs being built not just on bombsites but where Georgian and Victorian buildings were wilfully demolished, but despite this, the district is still known for its numerous elegant Georgian garden squares, and the brutalist intrusions have improved with age or now seem democratic.\nBloomsbury timeline:\nC1-C4:\nRoman remains show settlement near Londinium.\nC12:\nName 'Blemondisberi' appears, after William de Blemond was given land by William the Conqueror.\nC13:\nEstate passes to Carthusian monks.\n1530s:\nHenry VIII grants the abbey and its land to the Earl of Southampton.\n1660s:\nBloomsbury begins urban development; Bloomsbury Square laid out.\n1753-1759:\nBritish Museum founded and opens in Montagu House.\n1775‚Äì1783:\nBedford Square constructed by Thomas Leverton for the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford.\n1800‚Äì1804:\nRussell Square designed by Humphry Repton; Tavistock, Gordon and Woburn Squares follow.\n1823‚Äì1852:\nCurrent British Museum building constructed.\n1828-1836:\nUniversity College London and University of London established.\nEarly C20:\nBloomsbury Group meets in Gordon and Tavistock Squares.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll meet outside our first sight, which is...\n1. Russell Square Underground Station\n: Architect Leslie Green, built 1906. Distinctive oxblood-red terracotta fa√ßade, iconic of early Underground stations on the Piccadilly Line.\nWe'll then go west along Bernard Street and south down Russell Square to...\n2. Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel:\nOriginally the Hotel Russell, by Charles Fitzroy Doll, built 1898. Lavish terracotta building in French Renaissance style. The four queens sculptures are noteworthy. It is said to have inspired the interiors aboard the\nTitanic\n.\nWe'll then walk around...\n3. Russell Square Gardens:\nLandscaped by Humphry Repton for the Duke of Bedford in 1804. One of London‚Äôs largest squares, with fine plane trees and fountains, although some newer buildings (such as the UCL School of Education and the Imperial Hotel, which is being refurbished) have intruded.\nWe'll then walk south down Montague Street, west along Great Russell Street and south down Museum Street to the A40 and...\n4. Church of St George, Bloomsbury:\nBy Nicholas Hawksmoor, built 1716‚Äì31. Eccentric stepped tower or ziggurat topped with a statue of George I as a Roman emperor. Considered one of Hawksmoor‚Äôs finest Baroque works. Dramatic and wayward, elephantine at street level, and increasingly delicate as it ascends.\nWe'll then walk east along the A40 to...\n5. Bloomsbury Square Gardens:\nLondon‚Äôs oldest surviving garden square, laid out in the 1660s. Once fronted Southampton House, a Jacobean mansion that gave Bloomsbury its aristocratic roots.\nWe'll then walk east along Theobalds Road and north up Boswell Street to...\n6. Great Ormond Street Hospital\n: Britain‚Äôs first dedicated children‚Äôs hospital, founded by Dr Charles West in 1852. J M Barrie donated the rights to\nPeter Pan\nto it in 1929, funding the hospital in perpetuity.\nWe'll then walk east along Great Ormand Street to...\n7. Lamb‚Äôs Conduit Street:\nNamed after William Lambe, who funded a conduit here in 1577 to bring fresh water to Holborn, so a rare Elizabethan survival in Bloomsbury‚Äôs urban memory. Today has lively independent shops and caf√©s.\nAnd then to Millman Street for...\n8. Rugby Tavern:\nA rare survival of a historic pub on Great James Street, dating to the C18. Named for Rugby School, which once owned the land here.\nWe'll walk north up Millman Street, and west along Guilford Street to the...\n9. Site of the Foundling Hospital:\nSet up by Thomas Coram, a retired shipwright and sea captain was so moved by the plight of children abandoned starving in the streets that he campaigned for 17 years start a foundling hospital. Many of rank and nobility supported it, including Thomas Gainsborough, William Hogarth and Georg Frederic Handel. It was the first purpose-built children‚Äôs charity hospital in Britain (1739). We'll see the spot where the children of destitute mothers would be abandoned into the care of the hospital. The hospital was demolished in the 1920s, but some of its interiors survive. The Coram Foundation Playing Fields are unique in that adults using them must be accompanied by a child rather than vice-versa.\nWe'll go north across Brunswick Square to the...\n10. Foundling Hospital Museum:\nThe building dates from 1935-7 to house the collections and interiors from the demolished Foundling Hospital. It contains many works of art from patrons such as Gainsborough and Hogarth. Some of the most moving objects are the tokens - coins, buttons, jewellery and poems ‚Äì left by mothers with their babies on admission, enabling the Foundling Hospital to match a mother with her child should she ever return to claim it. The overwhelming majority of the children weren't, and the tokens are in the care of the museum. The adjacent sculpture of Coram is by William Macmillan from 1963.\nGoing back on ourselves west to Hunter Street, we'll turn east down Handel Street to...\n11. St George‚Äôs Gardens:\nLaid out as a burial ground for St George‚Äôs Bloomsbury and St George‚Äôs Hanover Square, and a rare survival in that it is unchanged. Atmospheric Georgian garden cemetery. Contains the grave of Anna Cromwell, granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\nGoing back down Handel street, westwards, we'll enter the...\n12. Brunswick Centre:\nDesigned by Patrick Hodgkinson from 1966 to 1971. Brutalist 'streets in the sky' development, now Grade II-listed. There's a Waitrose here in which you could get lunch.\nLeaving the Brunswick Centre, we'll be on Marchmont Street, which we'll head north along to find...\n13. 57 Marchmont Street:\nChildhood flat of comic actor and diarist Kenneth Williams, above his father‚Äôs barber shop. Marchmont Street retains much of its C19 shopfront character.\nWe'll then walk west down Coram Street and south down Herbrand Street to get to the...\n14. Daimler Garage, Herbrand Street:\nFormer Daimler Car Hire Garage, by Wallis, Gilbert & Partners, built in 1931. Bold and suave Art Deco design with faience cladding.\nWe'll then go north back up Herbrand Street to Tavistock Place to see...\n15. Mary Ward House:\nA lovely Arts and Crafts design from 1897 by Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Claude Brewer. The Mary Ward foundation supports education, social reform, and community activities. Its architecture features handcrafted brickwork and masonry. Mary Ward worked to improve education and representation for the poor, but was a staunch opponent of giving women the right to vote, and in 1908 she became the founding President of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League.\nWestwards around the corner is...\n16. Tavistock Square:\nPart of Bloomsbury‚Äôs grid of Georgian terraces. Leads towards Tavistock Square, long associated with writers and reformers. The headquarters of the British medical Association is on the Square. We'll have lunch here in the gardens (or in the Pret opposite). The bronze bust of Virginia Woolf is a casting of Stephen Tomlin‚Äôs original 1931 sculpture from 2004. The statue of Mahatma Gandhi - depicting him in a meditative lotus position - is by Fredda Brilliant, unveiled in 1968\nWe'll then head further west to...\n17. Gordon Square:\nBuilt in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt as part of the Bedford Estate‚Äôs expansion. Its residents gave the Bloomsbury Group its name. Virginia Woolf lived at no. 46, Lytton Strachey, essayist and biographer, also lived in the square as did the economist John Maynard Keynes and the author E.M. Forster. Other intellectuals regularly visited.\nAnd see at the corner of the square...\n18. Church of Christ the King:\nDesigned by Raphael Brandon in a Gothic-revival style, chiefly Early English. Now home to various Christian communities but under the Catholic Apostolic Church. Incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a fa√ßade), and the spire and full height of its tower are missing. We'll have time to explore.\nWe'll go up Gordon Street, then west along Gower Place, then south down Gower Street to...\n19. University College London:\nBy William Wilkins from 1826‚Äì30 who also designed the National Gallery. The neoclassical dome and portico (akin to his design for the National Gallery) were a symbol of progressive, secular education. It was the first English university to admit students regardless of religion, the first in the world to admit women, and the first to have an LGB society (thanks go to Steve Rowett for this information).\nWe'll then turn east along Torrington Place then south down Malet Street to...\n20. Senate House:\nBy Charles Holden (1937), soaring Art Deco limestone tower. Served as the Ministry of Information in WWII and famously inspired Orwell‚Äôs 'Ministry of Truth' in\n1984\n. It became 'Stuyvesant Towers' in New York, the location for Bertie Wooster's New York apartment in the ITV\nJeeves and Wooster\n. It is unlikely that Hitler personally wanted Senate House to be his headquarters in the event of Operation Sealion being successful, but being imposing and defensible it was identified by Nazi planners as a suitable headquarters for the German occupation government.\nWe'll continue down Malet Street to Montagu Place, then go west along it to...\n21. Bedford Square:\nThe most complete surviving Georgian square in London from 1770s. Uniform terraces, once fashionable residences, now mostly academic offices. 'Bedford Square' local lad Kenneth Williams enthused '...really is what Bloomsbury in its heyday was all about. Lovely rows of Georgian houses surrounding a garden. The garden itself providing an oasis against all the hubbub of urban life and aesthetically pleasing too.'\nAfter going round that, we'll head south along Bloomsbury Street to Great Russell Street and the...\n22. British Museum:\nBy Sir Robert Smirke, 1823-1852. The Greek Revival design is monumental and famous, but rigid. The collections inside are vast, diverse and iconic, yet often criticized for colonial acquisitions and a lack of contextual interpretation. Ian Nairn wrote in\nNairn's London,\n'Smirke was under the impression that architecture could be created by wrapping and great number of ionic columns around a big E shaped mass. It is putting together a building from the outside, instead of designing it from a central idea, and it never comes alive for a moment‚Äô.

    "Summary": "At 1550ft above sea level, Skiddaw House is the highest hostel in Britain. It was built around 1829 as a 'Keeper's lodge' and grouse shooting base for George Wyndham, the third Earl of Egremont. The building was originally divided into two separate dwellings; one side for the gamekeeper and his family and the other for a shepherd's family. The Earl and his shooting parties also had a few rooms to stay in when they came to visit. In 1986 the two dwellings were converted into the hostel it is today.\nSkiddaw House operated as a youth hostel from 1987 until 2002, when it closed and began to fall into disrepair again. But with the help of the previous hostel manager, many volunteers and the Skiddaw House Foundation, the hostel was renovated and reopened in 2007. The building retains many original features, which combined with its interesting history and remote location make the hostel a unique place to stay.\nOne of the great features of Skiddaw House is its remote location, offering stunning views of the surrounding Lakeland fells. This venue is an OutdoorLads favourite and is truly special, right from the moment you park up you'll understand why this is so glorious!\nHowever, the remote nature of the hostel means it is lacking the mod cons we may be used to, such as heating. Don't panic, there are a number of open fires throughout the building which helps keep it warm, but the bedrooms do not have any heating. Full bedding of 15tog duvets and pillow are provided but some may prefer to pack their own sleeping bag. Boots are also not allowed to be worn inside so we recommend packing slippers too!\nItinerary\nFriday Afternoon/Evening -\nArrive at the car park for 2:30pm, meet the rest of the group and we will hike up to the hostel together, sharing the load of weekend food supply bags. Please have your head torch handy in case we start to lose the light! ¬†Once we have arrived and found our beds, there will be a briefing and we'll have the usual OutdoorLads buffet so please bring something that can be shared between two people (doesn't need to be complicated).\n(\nImportant note: You need to plan to be there at 2:30pm as we will then hike in together. We won't have scope to come back for stragglers and there is no phone signal at the car park. If you know you won't be able to meet at 2:30pm, please message the event leader before you book to discuss any other possibilities.)\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast will be available. ¬†The main activity will be mountain walks (how many options we can offer depends on how many other mountain leaders book on). With hits like Skiddaw and Blencathra on our doorstep there are excellent options all around. ¬†However we are also looking at the possibility of an (optional) conservation project of some kind in conjunction with the new owners of Skiddaw - more information will follow on this if we are able to arrange something.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop your feet up and unwind from the days activities. We will be putting together a two course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs. ¬†While the hostel has a few, if you have a favourite travel size board/card game why not bring it?\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided once more then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am. ¬†Once done we will take everything we brought back to the car park and then people might want to head home, into Keswick for an afternoon touristing, or if there is the demand there could be another walk offered.\nOther information\nBeds:\nThere are two double beds in the hostel (not in private rooms sorry!). Please let the leader know when you book if you are coming with a partner or friend you are happy to share a bed with, so that we can enable as many people as possible to join this weekend.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nSkiddaw House requires a 1 hour hike to access it from the car park. To ensure everyone arrives safely we ask that all attendees meet at the car park for 2:30pm Friday so that we can hike up together. You will need to carry everything you need for the weekend including food and drink, in one trip - so pack light!\nPhotos:\nProvided by event leader Neil (pacer142) with permission for use.",

    "Summary": "'Oh no, not again!' you might exclaim at seeing the location and route for this walk, but it is a complete classic. We'll follow the boring footpath along the railway line to the castellated entrance to Clayton Tunnel. We'll look at the twelfth century wall paintings in Clayton Church. We'll reacquaint ourselves with Jack and Jill, the pair of windmills on the South Downs Way. We'll follow that national trail over Ditchling Beacon to Plumpton. We'll see the modest house that the Queen Consort grew up in. We'll take tea and cake in the delightful village of Ditchling. In brief, every last classic and curious feature of the South Downs behind Brighton, plus the views from them over the Weald and over the city itself.\nThe sights:\nClayton:\nA downland village with, as Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\nputs it, 'one¬†striking surprise and two oddities. The oddities are¬†the castellated entrance to the railway tunnel of 1840, and Jack and Jill, a mismatched pair of windmills, he a¬†brick tower mill of 1876, she a wooden post mill of 1821,¬†relocated from Brighton in 1850. [Unfortunately Jack is currently indisposed: he's lost his sails while restoration work goes on. Jill is functioning and open to visitors in the summer].¬†The surprise¬†is the wall paintings of 1140¬†in the humble church of St John the Baptist. They are unique in England for their extent, preservation and date.' Buried in the churchyard is Norman Hartnell (1901-1979), fashion designer, best known for his work for the ladies of the royal family including the late queen. Discreetly homosexual and cousin to William Hartnell, first actor to play the Doctor in Doctor Who.\nDitchling Beacon:\nAt 248 metres, it is the highest point in East Sussex. In¬†the care of the\nNational Trust\n, a¬†wide variety of plants can be found there, from chalk downland herbs to certain types of orchid. The hill gives panoramic views to Brighton to the south,¬†the¬†Weald to the north,¬†and the¬†South Downs stretching away to the west and east.\nPlumpton:\nAnimator Gordon Murray's alleged inspiration for Trumpton (Chailey became Chigley and Wivelsfiled Green Camberwick Green) is just a street of cottages with the main suburban residential area at Plumpton Green near the racecourse. St Michael's church is small and Norman with a C13 chancel, but has some faded wall paintings. Plumpton Place is Jacobean, but remodelled by Lutyens in 1927-8. The Laine (former rectory) was the childhood home of Camilla, Queen Consort. At Plumpton Cross Simon de Montfort and his army descended the Downs to engage¬†the army of Henry III at the battle of Lewes in 1264.\nStreat:\nIn a beautiful location with a view to the Downs. The church is over-restored, Norman and C13, but now mostly of 1854. Imposing Streat Place is from 1607-27.\nDitchling:\nBuilt on a crossroads which has the C13 and C14 St Margaret's Church high above it, and very pretty in flint, timber, brick and tile. Interesting buildings include: 'Anne of Cleves' House', which was given by Henry VIII to his fourth queen¬†as part of her marriage annulment settlement; and 'Sopers', the home of wood engraver, stone sculptor, type designer and sexual abuser Eric Gill, which became an artistic community and inspires a museum of the arts and crafts today (designed 2014 by Adam¬†Richards Architects). Noted Ditchling residents include Raymond Briggs and Dame Vera Lynn. Ditchling also has a good supply of pubs and tearooms of which we'll make use.\nKeymer:\nOldlands Windmill is C18, a post mill with an octagonal brick round house.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to see the route details including elevations at the OS¬†website)\n:\nA long, rather tedious footpath next to the railway line will take us to Clayton, where we'll pick up a bridleway past the windmills to connect with the South Downs Way along which we'll head east. At Plumpton Bostall we'll descend the Downs and head north along Plumpton Lane then use footpaths to go near Plumpton Racecourse. We'll then veer west and follow an intermittent bridleway to Streat and Ditchling. At Ditchling we'll head north past Lodge Hill to Oldland. Suburban streets through Keymer and Hassocks will take us back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. There may be some stiles and livestock, plus some roads to walk along. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Picture credits: View over the Low Weald:\nPhoto\n¬©\nChris Morgan\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Ditchling Beacon by Chris Thomas-Atkin:\nPhoto\n¬©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Jack and Jill Windmills (Clayton Windmills):\nPhoto\n¬©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Big Bottom:\nPhoto\n¬©\nIan Capper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Plumpton - Half Moon Public House:\nPhoto\n¬©\nJames Emmans\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A beautiful autumn afternoon at St Michael, Plumpton (b):\nPhoto\n¬©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Streat Place:\nPhoto\n¬©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Clay vale pasture:\nPhoto\n¬©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); In the centre of Ditchling:\nPhoto\n¬©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); High Street, Ditchling:\nPhoto\n¬©\nPeter Whitcomb\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Oldland Mill, Keymer:\nPhoto\n¬©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "This walk is a most attractive one, predominantly across fields and through woods, ¬†however don't be deceived by the lovely surroundings as our midway destination of Annesley Hall has quite the chilling aura about it.\nNestled in Nottinghamshire, just next to derelict and spooky Annesley Old Church surrounded by grisly looking gnarled gravestones, the atmosphere can make one quite skittish. ¬†This historic mansion has seen centuries of change, from its medieval beginnings to its Georgian grandeur.\nThe gentle walk back crosses over an old mott and bailey castle earthwork.\nHistorical Insights:\nAnnesley Hall dates back to the 13th century and has been home to several notable families, including the Chaworths and the Byrons. The hall is famously connected to Lord Byron, the notorious poet, who had a doomed love affair with Mary Chaworth, the heiress to Annesley Hall. This unrequited love inspired some of his early works and added to the hall's romantic yet eerie legacy.\nA Spooky Tale:\nLegend has it that the ghost of Mary Chaworth herself haunts the grounds of Annesley Hall. People have reported seeing a forlorn woman in white wandering the gardens at night, believed to be Mary, still mourning her lost love. Some say you can hear whispering in the hallways or see flickering lights in the abandoned rooms. The most spine-tingling tale involves an old oak tree where it's said Mary and Lord Byron would secretly meet. At midnight, those brave enough to stand by the tree might hear whispers of their tragic love story carried on the wind.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

You will be given all the equipment you need for snowshoeing.\nDay 2 (13th March) Snow shoe skills journey ¬†10km 500m of ascent and descent\nWe‚Äôll complete a short journey into the Swiss wilderness in order to learn to use the snow shoes and how to move with ease. We will also cover safety aspects to ensure you stay safe during the trip.\nIn the afternoon you can relax with a glass of wine or visit the local spa. We will overnight for a second night in the hotel near Martigny.\nDay 3 (14th March) Journey to the hospice 7km with 600m ascent\nToday after packing our bags for the night we will ascend to the Grand Saint Bernard Hospice. We will have lunch with the monks then continue the journey crossing into Italy before heading back to the hospice for the night. Dinner will once again be with the monks and there is optional attendance at Vespers (evening prayer).\nDay 4 (15th March) Return from the hospice 7km with 600m descent\nToday after breakfast and packing your bags we descend back to the valley. We will visit a Laiterie to learn about alpine cheese making and try some cheese and then go onto\nBarryLand\n. This is home to the Saint-Bernard dog, and a cuddle is welcomed.\nYou will be dropped off at Martigny train station at 1500 to catch a train back to Geneva or onwards. You will need to organize your own flights to Geneva and train ticket to Martigny from\nSwiss Rail\n.\nHow fit do I need to be?\nWe will be moving at a gentle pace when snowshoeing. Although it is a bit harder than walking it is not an extreme sport. We will be out in conditions that could be very bright and sunny or cold and snowy. It is more the ability to cope with these conditions that is important. If you would be happy going for a gentle winter walk in any conditions in the UK mountains you will find this trip straightforward.\nPhoto Credits: Tom Brodie for use to promote the event.\nHow to Book\nTo book your place on this trip (or secure a place on the waiting list) please pay a ¬£215 deposit directly to\nPride Expeditions\n.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale. ¬†Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes. ¬† We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave. ¬†This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more. ¬†For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby. ¬†If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat! ¬†Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday. ¬†The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby. ¬†This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share. ¬†In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader. ¬†There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food! ¬†Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! ¬†Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend. ¬†The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music). ¬†Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10. ¬†There are two hot electric showers. ¬†From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location. ¬†It is much easier to park in the village and walk down. ¬†There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! -¬†Participation Statement\nYou¬†MUST¬†complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space¬†before¬†attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Gosaikunda Trek and Raft Expedition\nOur Gosaikunda trekking and rafting expedition offers a little bit of everything Nepal has to offer neatly packaged into a two week expedition. We will trek off the beaten track for seven days from the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley into the stunning Langtang region of Nepal.\nThe trek starts at Sundarija just a short drive from Kathmandu. It enters the mountains through the Shivapuri National Park before crossing the Lauribina pass at 4,610m. This the site of the sacred Gosaikunda lakes; a Hindu pilgrimage site linked to Shiva‚Äôs trident.\nWe descend from Gosaikunda to the next phase of the expedition on the Trisuli river which is a 4-hour drive from the end of the trek.. We spend two days rafting on the Trisuli river and then travel to Chitwan National Park. Here it is possible to see elephants, crocodiles, rhino and perhaps a tiger. After two nights in Chitwan we fly back to Kathmandu on an internal flight.\nOutdoorLads has organised this expedition to see the most thrilling locations Nepal has to offer with minimal time spent on long bus journeys. It offers a chance to get off the beaten track and really get to know Nepal.\nOur¬†trip organizer¬†(and OutdoorLads Member)¬†Nick Read, is¬†a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs Pride Expeditions. ¬†He has led an¬†OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and 2017 and a raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012.
