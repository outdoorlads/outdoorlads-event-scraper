Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times.

    "People Attending": "3",
    "Summary": "This is one of a series of walks taking advantage of the main and narrow gauge trains of Wales, most of which are incredibly scenic.\nOn this walk we will use the service of the Holyhead to Chester main line to return to the start. We join the train at the town with the longest name in Europe and the second longest in the world. Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch.  Naturally you will want the obligatory selfie under the station name sign!\nBefore that frivolous moment the walk actually passes some very interesting scenery along the Menai straights, not least the iconic suspension bridge built by Thomas Telford; indeed we will cross it too. The walk will also take you past Bangor Cathedral, the site of which which dates by to the 6C, and out onto Bangor Pier, to view the 'Straights. (50p Admission charge - pls bring cash). This walk is mostly on tarmac, so ordinary footwear should suffice.\nSome background info derived from Wikipedia:\nLlanfairPG\nThe long name was supposedly contrived in 1869 as an early publicity stunt to give the station the longest name of any railway station in Britain. According to Sir John Morris-Jones the name was created by a local tailor, whose name he did not confide, letting the secret die with him.  Literally translated, the long form of the name means: \"[The] church of [St.] Mary (Llanfair) [of the] pool (pwll) of the white hazels (gwyn gyll) near to [lit. \"over against\"] (go ger) the fierce whirlpool (y chwyrn drobwll) [and] the church of [St.] Tysilio (Llantysilio) of the red cave (gogo[f] goch)\". Various elements have occasionally been translated differently. In September 2015, Channel 4 News weatherman Liam Dutton went viral around the world after accurately pronouncing the name of the town in one of his weather reports. In 2024 Volkswagen used the difficult name of the village in a TV commercial as an example to show the functions of the inbuilt navigation system's AI and speech recognition.\nThe Bridges:\nIn 1826, Anglesey was connected to the rest of Wales by the construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge by Thomas Telford, and connected with London in 1850 with the building of the Britannia Bridge and the busy North Wales Coast railway line, which connected the rest of Great Britain to the ferry port of Holyhead.  Unfortunatley A fire in May 1970 caused extensive and irreparable damage to the original Britannia Bridge. The modern bridge was rebuilt in a quite different configuration, reusing the piers while employing new arches to support not one but two decks, as the new Britannia Bridge was to function as a combined road-and-rail bridge, opening fully in 1980.\nAll photos:\nAndyM, event leader, except Britannia Bridge and Llanfair PG sign, with thanks to Stephen Turner.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nShorter day? New Member?\nFancy coming along to try out the group but want to go home early? This is a perfect event for new members and as we are walking through a town, you can head back whenever, just be sure to let the leader know so we are not wondering where you are!\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but please note his walk goes through busy streets and your dog needs to be well behaved and on a lead, and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.  Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Some cafes etc for drinks may not welcome dogs.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help, also please be sure to fill in the participation statement.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Come and walk the old railways of Granton, Newhaven & Leith\nLong before the phrase Active Travel entered government lexicon Lothian Regional Council started buying old railway trackbeds from British Rail, as BR went about removing the railway network in the 70s and 80s that had existed across the north of Edinburgh. This foresightedness has left a legacy of a network of popular paths crossing the city.\nThis figure of eight walk covers a large proportion of these lines, starting from Scotland Street station which was the original terminus of the Edinburgh, Leith & Newhaven railway when it opened in August 1842. From here we head north to Trinity and west to Granton. Here the EL&G (having decided that it wanted to go to Granton, not just Newhaven) met the Caledonian and we take up the Caleys route south to Crew junction before heading east to Leith. From Leith we pick up the EL&G again which takes us back to Scotland Street.\nApart from one detour near Chancelot, the route is entirely on tarmac paths as the council have improved these railway paths for cyclists. Whilst most of the routes are as they were when rails ran along them much has changed around them, so is an interesting perspective on the changing face of Edinburgh and Leith.\nPhotos :\nTaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for the monthly \"Fri-Gay\" night at The Climbing Hanger (TCH) in Reading!\nThe session is supported by one of the centre's own coaches giving you the opportunity to get some professional tuition. And is a great opportunity to connect with the wider LGBT+ community in the Reading area.\nWhat is bouldering?\nBouldering is a style of climbing that involves short routes, called \"problems\", which can be tackled without the need for ropes and harnesses. This makes it an ideal place to start if you are new to climbing. The routes emphasise technique and problem solving so it's a workout for your brain as well as your body. As a result, bouldering is a very sociable activity - giving you the opportunity to catch-up and meet new people as you try out problems together.\nNew to bouldering?\nThe only equipment you need to get started is a pair of climbing shoes. These can be hired from the wall for free. The event leader will be on-hand to get your started and give a few points on technique. So you'll quickly be climbing with the rest of the group.\nRegistering for Fri-Gay on the TCH website\nFri-Gay is a bookable session on the TCH website. Please book a place,\nin addition to this ODL event\n, using the link below so they know how many people to expect:\nLink to the Fri-Gay page on the TCH website\nFirst visit to The Climbing Hanger?\nIf you have not visited The Climbing Hanger before, you will need to complete a waiver and an in-person induction with the centre staff.

    "Summary": "This scenic 10 km walk takes you along the banks of the River Clyde, through ancient woodlands, and past the breathtaking Falls of Clyde. A mix of gentle riverside strolling and woodland trails, the route offers a blend of natural beauty, rich history, and fascinating engineering feats. Expect to see an abundance of wildlife, including otters, kingfishers, and possibly even peregrine falcons.\nThe River Clyde\nOne of Scotland’s most famous rivers, the Clyde stretches for 176 km (109 miles) from its source in the Lowther Hills to the Firth of Clyde. It has played a crucial role in Scotland’s history, from its significance in shipbuilding and industry to its function as a lifeline for trade and commerce. Today, while its industrial past is still evident in Glasgow, the upper stretches of the river offer a tranquil escape into nature.\nThe Walk Route\nThe journey begins in the charming village of New Lanark, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Founded in the late 18th century by David Dale and later developed by social reformer Robert Owen, New Lanark was a pioneering model of workers’ welfare and progressive industry.\nFrom here, follow the well-marked Clyde Walkway as it meanders through dense woodlands and alongside the flowing river. Soon, the sound of rushing water signals your arrival at the Falls of Clyde—a spectacular series of waterfalls comprising Dundaff Linn, Corra Linn, Bonnington Linn, and Stonebyres Linn. Corra Linn, the most famous of the falls, drops dramatically from a height of 27 metres (90 feet) and was once admired by poet William Wordsworth.\nAs you continue, the trail offers numerous viewpoints, allowing you to take in the raw power and beauty of the falls. Interpretive signs provide insight into the area's rich biodiversity, with red deer, badgers, and a variety of bird species calling this habitat home.\nHydropower at the Falls of Clyde\nIn addition to its natural beauty, the Falls of Clyde also showcase an important chapter in Scotland’s renewable energy history. The Bonnington Power Station, constructed in 1926, was Scotland’s first commercial hydroelectric plant and remains operational today. Harnessing the power of the Clyde, the station provides clean electricity while seamlessly blending into its surroundings. An information board near the plant details its operation and contribution to Scotland’s energy network.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but please note and abide by the\nScottish Outdoor Access Code\n.  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nPhotos :\nTaken by ODL Member simmcgil42.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "8 miles Circular Walk\nA walk with amazing views, wildlife and history in the middle of the West Midlands! Come and see the view from the highest point in the metropolitan West Midlands, Turners Hill (271m) and it's twin Darby's Hill (270m). The views East of the Birmingham Skyline are impressive; West on a clear day Hay Bluff in the Brecon Beacons of Wales can be seen, as well as the Shropshire Hills and Malverns. The site is even included in a list of the best panorama views of the UK. You can identify what's on the horizon here:\nDarby’s Hill panorama\n.\nThis walk is surprisingly green. In what was known as the 'Black Country' for the smoke from it's industry, we walk by two green areas which were formerly quarries and clay mines, and have been totally regenerated. One is now a wildlife sanctuary.\nSheepwash Wildlife park is now home to locally rare flowers including snakeshead fritillary, cowslip and yellow bartsia. You would never guess that in the 19th century there was a clay mine, brickworks and coal shafts on this site. Read the history here:\nSheepwash history\n.\nConnecting the two are sections of canal near the Netherton Tunnel, one of the longest in the country. We have a short, exciting stretch of tunnel ourselves to reach the reserve (actually, it's a long Victorian underpass, but feels like something more!). When I checked out this walk, I saw Kingfishers by the canal. One canal is slightly higher up than the other: the canals were once so busy that Thomas Telford designed a new, straighter and broader canal, the Birmingham Navigation, which we shall follow back to the station. More details of the history are here:\nBirmingham Canal Navigation\n.\nThis walk is timed to start with the arrival of the trains as listed below. Why not park and ride into Birmingham or Wolverhampton after the event? With trains roughly every 15 minutes, take advantage of quieter Sunday free parking and take the 10-minute train ride into the city centre to enjoy the rest of your day!\nWell behaved dogs are welcome to come with you on this walk.\nWaitlist\n: If this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for the Sheffield LBGTQ+ climbing night, starting with a social meet-up followed by some climbing. This will be an informal event, with team member(s) of the climbing centre there to offer advice and some supervision. The cost is the standard entry fee to the centre. Informal tuition will also be able from OutdoorLads, but this is dependent on numbers.\nAnyone can join the event, but please do sign up here so we can pass numbers on to the climbing centre.\nSo.... a bit about climbing and the centre..\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form. You can pay at the centre on arrival or online beforehand. If you pay in person at the centre a small discount is available if you mention you're with ODL.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nYes! Beginners are very welcome. If you've never climbed before, just let us know by messaging the event leader or co-leader, so we can arrange for you to be signed into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try. If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely. Please note that we are limited by the climbing centre as to the number of novice climbers we can supervise, according to the number of experienced people / staff available at the event.\nDo I have to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you can answer YES to all these questions, you can climb without supervision:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the UK. We are always keen to put more on, so if you fancy climbing in your local area contact a climbing leader and we can see what we can arrange.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by Keith\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "While most of us in ODL are probably perfectly happy experiencing the vibrancy, opportunity and anonymity of the city, some might yearn for the calmness, spaciousness and neighbourliness of a village. If you come on this event, you'll sample the latter for one idyllic summer afternoon.\nIan Nairn, writing in\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n, briefly describes Grayswood as: \" A trim, triangular green, largely Victorian, in picturesque hilly country near the Sussex border.\" The National Open Gardens website additionally invites us to \"Visit Grayswood's gorgeous gardens - all very different, [from] informal cottage style, [to] larger more formal and varied village gardens. Visitors will have an illustrated garden trail to follow through the village [and] there will be homemade cakes and tea at the Village Hall.\" In the past there have been a display of classic cars at Grayswood garage and a plant sale.\nThere will be no set plan for visiting the 10 or so gardens and we won't go round in a big group: you're welcome to go wherever and with whomever you choose. You're also welcome to leave earlier or later, but there will be an agreed meeting place and time should you wish to depart as part of a group, perhaps to catch a particular train. In fact, you don't even need to book on this event to see the gardens of course; we'll just happily bump into you in the village! If you do come by train (or car but want a little more exercise), Haslemere Railway Station is a hour's walk from the village, so we'll have a pleasant walk through the swish suburbs and rough heaths while viewing Hindhead Common to get there. (Please see the route\nhere\n.)\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for them. Some gardens might admit them on leads, others might not. I'll enquire. Being Surrey I imagine that they are. They'll enjoy the walk to the village.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIf all you know of Micheldever is the railway station stranded miles from anywhere, then boy are you in for a surprise if you come on this relatively easy little walk. Once we've covered a few miles of undulating arable fields we'll reach the River Dever and the sequestered stretch of idyllic little villages, fine manor houses, ancient remote churches and vintage watercress beds that it trickles through. This is where the chief interest of the walk will lie: watching the trout skulking beneath the sparkling surface, gazing at rambling roses over cottage walls and dawdling amid weathered willow trees. A line by AE Housman springs to mind: 'On the idle hill of summer, sleepy with the flow of streams'.\nThe sights:\nWest Stratton:\nA pleasant hamlet of cob walls and timber-framed cottages.\nMicheldever\n: A moderately-sized village of black and white cottages around a road junction. St Mary's Church has a perpendicular gothic tower that leads through to a delightful octagonal nave by George Dance the Junior (architect of St Bartholomew the Less in Smithfield, and the façade of the London Guildhall) from 1806.\nStoke Charity:\nA once larger settlement but much diminished, with the church standing alone in water meadows. It was once accompanied by the manor house of the De la Charité family from whom the village took part of its name. St Mary and St Michael is a picturesque but rather plain building from the C14 and C15, but its glory is internal, as no other church in Hampshire has such a collection of medieval and later monuments. There are brasses to the Hampton and Waller families and a remarkable sculpture of the Mass of St Gregory from c1500. Michaels is a C16 timber-framed house and Old Rectory is mid-C19 neo-Tudor. Norsebury House is from 1919 by Ernest Newton, a neo-Georgian encasing of a Victorian villa, with a matching wing of 2001.\nHunton:\nA small settlement with a church alone in the water meadows. St James is a small chapel, c1500.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll walk west along the Andover Road and turn south along Weston Down Road. At Weston, we'll turn west along Winchester Road and soon pick up a footpath to Hunton where we'll take Hunton Lane. At Hunton Church, we'll take a footpath over the River Dever southeast to Stoke Charity for a possible earlier lunch. We'll then head east along Sloe Lane and follow a loop around Micheldever to have a possible later lunch and a pub stop. Footpaths and bridleways will take us east to West Stratton and a lane will take us north to Larkwhistle Farm Road which we'll walk west along back to Micheldever Railway Station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "Join Andy and OutdoorLads for invigorating\nSunday\nfrolics around the moors of Bolton.\nWell off the beaten path, we will be taking in some amazing 360 panoramic views of the North West, inlcuding Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire.  We will be visiting many historical tourist attractions and places of interest along the way.\nWe will start off across the moorland heading up to the Two Lads stone statues before heading down to the Snack Shack where we will have a well deserved coffee break. There will be opportunity to purchase hot drinks and a selection of fresh cakes/biscuits.\nOnwards to the Japanese Gardens at Rivington, where we will stop and have lunch. From here, we will climb up to Rivington Pike and admire the views from 1, 200ft, before heading up to the Winter Hill TV Mast, (to 1, 250 feet), where we will stop to admire further views before making our return journey.\nThe main points of interest on this walk include the Two Lads, tree plantation, Snack Shack, Japanese Gardens,  Aztec Bridges, Italian Gardens, The Pike, Pigeon Tower, and the TV stations.\n11 a.m. start.\nWinter Hill\nWinter Hill is the highest point in the West Pennine area and towers over Rivington and its surroundings, although it is not tall enough to be classed as a mountain. Winter Hill is really a large, raised plateau of moorland with several summits named as hills in their own right, one being Rivington Pike. There are several other notable hills including Counting Hill, Noon Hill, Crooked Edge Hill, Adam Hill, Brown Hill and more. The summit of Winter Hill itself is rather understated and tucked away at the very end of the mast road behind the smaller radio masts and is marked by an OS trig point.\nThe name Winter Hill is probably derived from Old Norse, the first recorded name for the hill being Wintyrheld which would mean literally Winter Hill. However, “winter” and its variations certainly had the meaning “wet” in the old times and therefore means “the wet hill”, rather than our modern associations of cold or snow. Colloquialisms like “winter pasture” meaning poor agricultural land, probably at one time meant wet land that could not be farmed but could be used for pasture if necessary.\nBetween those times and now, it seems Winter Hill was shown as Egberden Hill on antique maps, which would be derived from the Egbert’s Dean, which is the area now known as the Smithills Estate. The valley (dean from OE denu) reaches quite far up the hill and was once a prosperous area so passing cartographers seem to heard the place referred to as Egbert’s Dean Hill.

    "Summary": "PLEASE READ ALL SECTIONS, INCLUDING WHAT TO BRING AND FOOD & DRINK\nYou can find out more about wild camping on this page:\nMy first wild camping event\n. You need to have mountain walking experience, good equipment and a good level of fitness to carry your food, sleeping bag, sleeping mat and small tent or bivvy bag for around 80 km (50 miles). We’ll walk about 20km (12.5 miles) each day. Sometimes it will be easy walking, other times we’ll be crossing parts of Dartmoor where there are no paths, rivers with no easy crossing points and rough boggy ground. The route will be partially determined by the water levels on the moor; we may need to change the route or walk late into the evenings if water levels increase. We may need to camp on exposed, wet, uneven ground.\nDartmoor has the best preserved prehistoric landscape in north western Europe. There are remains of over 5000 roundhouses, over 1500 cairns, and a remarkable set of ceremonial monuments dating from the late Neolithic to early Bronze age, including over 20\nstone circles\nand over 75\nstone rows\n. This trek visits the most impressive of these monuments. The\nfour day linear route\ncrosses Dartmoor from north to south, from\nOkehampton\nto\nIvybridge\n. Participants will need to make their own transport arrangements to the start and from the end. Trains run from Exeter St David's to Okehampton and Ivybridge. If coming by car, leaving the car in Exeter looks to be the best option (see the Location section below for details).\nOn the first day we'll visit Nine Maiden's Stone Circle, Cosdon Stone Rows (the most impressive prehistoric triple stone row in Britain), White Moor Stone Circle, Buttern Hill Stone Circle, Scorhill Stone Circle (Devon's finest stone circle) and Shovel Down Stone Rows.\nOn the second day we'll visit Fernworthy Stone Circle, Assycombe Stone Row, The Grey Wethers Stone Circles, Postbridge (shop and visitor centre), Lakehead Hill Stone Row & Cist, and Wistman's Wood (one the highest oakwoods and last remaining temperate rainforests in Britain). Depending on progress we might stop at the pub in Merrivale at the end of the day.\nOn the third day we'll visit the Merrivale Stone Rows & Stone Circle, Hart Tor Stone Rows, Down Tor Stone Row, Yellowmead Concentric Stone Circle, Ringmoor Stone Row and Brisworthy Stone Circle. On the last day we'll visit Drizzle Combe Stone Rows, Grim's Grave Cairn Circle, Erme Valley Stone Row (3.4 km long, the longest prehistoric stone row in the world) and Stalldown Stone Row.\nImage / photo credits:\nPhotos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 19 © Patrick Revell, used with permission.\nAll other photos\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n:\nPhoto 6 ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6359382\nPhoto 8 ©\nPete Cruse\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7990264\nPhoto 9 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406301\nPhoto 10 ©\nIan Capper\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7090708\nPhoto 11 ©\nVieve Forward\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6131085\nPhoto 12 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406389\nPhoto 13 and banner ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155589\nPhoto 14 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6404933\nPhoto 15 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410273\nPhoto 16 ©\nGuy Wareham\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/1911220\nPhoto 17 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6417803\nPhoto 18 ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155580\nPhoto 20 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410089\nPhoto 21 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6409234\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

If you’re lucky enough you may spot the puffins. There are information boards and further viewing platforms at Bempton, where there’ll be an opportunity for a refreshment break at the cafe before we head back along the same route in reverse giving twice the opportunity to take photos and take in the sea views. You might want to bring a zoom camera or binoculars to get really close. I have, however, just taken the pictures here included with a regular phone camera.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday.

And yet there is plenty packed into its small area - from the dramatic stump of An Sgurr rising to 393m that we can scramble up, across the moorlands and to the Singing Sands that is Traigh a' Bhigeil.  There is plenty of history packed into the small isle with Massacre Cave to explore, a deserted township at Grulin and various ruins marking over 8000 years of people living on the land.\nBike hire is available on the island, and if the weather is kind we could hire some kayaks and get to see the island from around its coast.\nTravel info\n- don't miss this ferry, as the next departure from Mallaig to Eigg isn't until Saturday.\nBoarding of the ferry is normally completed at least 10 minutes prior to the sailing time.\nTravel is not included in the event price, you will need to book and pay for your own transport to to and from the island.\nOn\nFriday\nwe\nleave Mallaig at\n08:00\nto arrive on Eigg at 10:45\nOn\nMonday\nwe depart Eigg at 17:30 to\narrive at Mallaig at 18:50\nWhy not make an adventure of your time in the area? You could depart Eigg at 11:50 on the Monday and travel onto Rum or Canna.\n(Note the ferry returns to Eigg for 17:30 before heading to Mallaig)\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Ben Donich is a Corbett (847m) near the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll. We'll be avoiding the crowds and taking a less-known and more interesting route up this popular mountain.\nWe'll meet at the car park (free parking & toilets) at Ardgartan on the A83. We'll start by wandering through the forest before heading out onto the open hill, and climbing Ben Donich along its south-easterly ridge. There are no paths and we'll be route-finding our way up between crags and boulders. Once on the summit ridge, we'll head to the top for hopefully great views south to the Clyde, west to the islands of Argyll, and north to the Central Highlands.\nWe'll descend towards the Rest and Be Thankful - this involves following a broad airy ridge, with one boulder field to negotiate (includes one very short scramble up - involving use of hands and feet). We'll get great views of the famous mountain pass of the Rest and Be Thankful. Our route then turns down Glen Croe, and we'll walk back down the glen, with some dramatic views of Beinn Ime and the Cobbler (and all the civil engineering works currently happening to try to fix the landslides on the A83).\nThis is a fun, relatively straightforward day for anyone looking for an adventurous mountain walk.\nPhotos :\nTaken by Drookitduck\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?

This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nSpurn point is what geologists call a 'spit', formed from the movement of sand and rocks down the coast by the tide over many years. This has resulted in a peninsula jutting out into the Humber estuary offering fantastic panoramic views across the north sea, mouth of the Humber, Northern Lincolnshire and west up the Humber estuary.\nWe'll take a walk out and back along the peninsula, which is a\nYorkshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve\n. In addition to the wildlife, throughout the walk we'll see reminders of the impact that WWII had on the area (e.g. tank traps, ruins of buildings, anti-aircraft gun mountings).\nThose of you who wish can visit the Easington Lighthouse (the tallest in Northern England) if it is open on the day. Access to the ground floor is free but entry to the upper levels is £4 adult/£3 concessions.\nPlease see the website for further details\n.\nContinuing on, we'll go past the RNLI station houses and boat launch which, sadly after 213 years of sea rescues, is now\nclosed\n. Toward the end of the peninsula we'll see the ruins of Spurn Point gun batteries and other defence-related structures.\nThere is a visitor centre and cafe near the car park, which has toilet facilities.\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the parts of the reserve that we will be accessing.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

In beautiful Rosedale, the charitable Ross Foundation and world renowned artist Andy Goldsworthy have combined to restore a series of ten barns, many formerly derelict, and turn them into a mind blowing art installation. This is not about a statue, or a painting, or poetry. Prepare to be amazed.\nHanging Stones has been conceived by Goldsworthy as a single artwork – the walk between each building is as much a part of the artwork as the buildings themselves. There are no images of the artwork on this event page in order to allow for maximum WOW factor on the walk.\nIt's a beautiful walk in its own right, using paths that are not public rights of way and only available for pre-booked groups. There are streams, meadows, pockets of woodland, moorland, all under glorious June sunshine (we hope). It's a circular walk.\nEach barn will be unlocked in turn by the leader to allow us to see the installation inside. There will be time to explore what's of offer, take pics etc. before locking the barn and moving on to the next one.\nAt the end, we will aim for refreshments. There are no refreshments en route, so bring food and water, but as our start time is noon, you can grab an early lunch in a cafe.\nThere is a charge for groups to access the installations (money which is used to maintain footpaths and protect natural habitats) and use otherwise private paths - hence the small fee to join this walk.\nPhotos:\nAll pictures taken by Mark Dooley or Rob Mitchell and used by OutdoorLads with permission.\nDogs\ncan be brought on this walk but must be well behaved and on a lead at all times because of the young lambs that will be around throughout the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Blean Woods National Nature Reserve - 8 Mile Woodland Walk\nJoin Nelly and Stuart for a scenic 8-mile journey through the enchanting Blean Woods National Nature Reserve, nestled near Canterbury. This walk takes you deep into a patchwork of ancient coppice woodlands, towering oak and beech trees, tranquil heathlands, and sunlit glades, offering a rich mix of habitats for both wildlife and nature lovers.\nAs you wander through the woods, you’ll be surrounded by the sounds of birdsong, with species like the Great Spotted Woodpecker and the rarer Lesser Spotted Woodpecker found in the towering oak and beech areas. The trees themselves tell their own story, with some left to decay and create vital homes for birds, bats, and insects. In the more open areas, you may spot butterflies basking in the warmth of the sun or catch sight of a Heath Fritillary, a rare and beautiful butterfly that thrives in these conditions.\nThroughout the walk, you’ll pass through areas where traditional coppicing takes place. This ancient practice, which involves cutting back trees to regrow, has created dense thickets ideal for nesting birds like the Nightingale. As the sunlight filters through the freshly cut areas, you’ll see an incredible variety of butterflies fluttering through the air, adding vibrant pops of color to the landscape.\nThis is the perfect opportunity to experience nature’s beauty, from towering trees to rare butterflies and delightful birdlife, in one of Kent’s most treasured nature reserves.\nNew Members\nWe’d love for this to be your first OutdoorLads event!\nIf you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly or check out the \"\nMy First Event\n\" section under \"About Us\" for more information.

    "Summary": "#GetOutMore this April!\nThis event is one of loads of events taking place over the same weekend! Check out all the events over the weekend of 4-6 April 2025:\nOutdoorLads.events/APR25\n. Great for new and regular members!\nJoin Ian as we hike in the footsteps of Wainwright. Wansfell Pike is a popular destination but in fact it's actually the lower companion of Baystones, a summit a kilometre to the northeast.\nThe confusion is partly Wainwright's doing, for he names Baystones as Wansfell in his books, and no doubt many fell walkers ascend Wansfell Pike thinking they've reached the true summit. In mitigation it has to be said that Wansfell Pike is a far nicer top than Baystones.\nThe walk starts in Ambleside near the Salutation Hotel in the centre. From here we'll head up Stockghyll Lane and follow the footpath that runs alongside the ghyll towards Stockghyll Force waterfall.\nWe'll have the opportunity to take photos of the falls before we make our ascent to Wansfell.\nAs the summit nears, the path passes through a rocky patch and soon leads to the summit of Wansfell (482m.)  Panoramic views towards Langdale, Coniston fells and Fairfield in particular. We then head along the ridge wall to the highest point, Wansfell Pike (487m) which is marked by a cairn.\nThe descent down from the fell takes us along fairly easy terrain towards the village of Troutbeck, where we may stop for a pint at the Mortal Man pub.\nThe final part of the walk takes us through the village along lanes, tracks, and through the delightful Skelghyll Wood back to Ambleside.\nWeather conditions\nWe may need to change the walk or postpone it in the event that weather conditions would make it unsafe.  I will let you know as soon as I can if this looks likely.\nDog Suitability\nThe route should be OK for well behaved dogs that are used to lowland hill walks, but please note they will need to be on a lead where livestock is present and may need lifting/carrying over obstacles e.g. stiles.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Your event leaders Ian & Ste look forward to welcoming you to this stunning part of the Yorkshire Dales.\nVenture into the upper reaches of Swaledale for a three night stay in the scenic, quiet, less populated part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nThe campsite is both a working farm and brilliant well thought out site, with great facilities. The villages of Muker, Keld and Thwaite are not too far away, and all have either a pub or a nice teashop for those cream tea lovers! Did someone mention cream tea!!\nThere are several different easy lower routes branching out in deep cut valleys, well marked tracks ascending to the higher fells and many well used paths and bridleways for a decent selection of hiking and strolling options between villages.\nThe campsite sits in a narrow part of the valley close to a flowing beck with the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast National Trails only a short stroll away.  The main camping field has a gentle slope extending from the foot of the hill slope to the farm and facilities. The ground is well drained and the grass well managed for really good pitches. A quiet path avoids the roads to either of the two close villages a fifteen minute stroll away.\nThis is limestone country with waterfalls, limestone escarpments and deep gorges & wonderful wildflower meadows that carpet the landscape.\nGreat Shunner Fell, Kisdon and Lovely Seat are the nearest high ground and the steeper slopes offer picture postcard perspectives. There is plentiful evidence of mining here especially at Gunnerside Gill and the Cow'us (stone barns) are dotted about the drystone walled enclosures dating back hundreds of years.\nThere will be a small  selection of walks each day for those who like a challenge, or a mid level wander. If you would prefer to just relax and explore this area at a slower pace you are also welcome to join us here.\nWalk/activity options will be discussed at the event briefing on Friday evening once everyone has arrived & settled in etc.\nThe campsite facilities include lockers with phone charging, modern showers and plenty of toilets in a block in the centre of the site.  The on-site shop is well stocked with local produce and handy if you’ve forgot something.\nFire pits can be hired from the on-site shop along with firewood.\nIf you chose to bring a fire pit or BBQ then these must be raised off the ground, so to not damage the ground. Open fires are not permitted!\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nCampervans, Motorhomes, caravans:\nThese are permitted at no extra cost.\nDogs:\nThe site welcomes dogs as long as they are kept under close control as the camping field is beside the working farm.\nPhotos:\nThe photos used are courtesy of event leaders Steven & Ian and OutdoorLads member Craig B and are all used with their permission.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a big day in the mountains as we complete a circuit of some of Eryri's tallest peaks, summitting six of the Carneddau's many peaks.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nYr Elen:\nAt 962m, this is the Carneddau's least visited peak, being a diversion on most classic routes. Our route takes us directly over the summit, giving us a great panorama of the rest of the Carneddau ridge.\nCarnedd Llywelyn :\nAt 1065m, this is our tallest peak and the summit of the Carneddau range; which is the highest area of upland habitat in the British Isles outside of Scotland. Due to it's vastness, the mountains are home to a large number of rare upland species, such as Hen Harriers, Ravens, Peregrine Falcons and Dotterels.\nFoel Grach:\nAt 976m, our third summit means the scabby hill, due the shattered rocks strewn over the summit. The summit also has a well built refuge, which will be a great lunch spot should the weather turn.\nCarnedd Gwenllian:\nAt 925m, out fourth hill has an interesting etymology. It's name was recently changed to be named after Gwenllian of Wales, the only daughter of the legendary Prince Llywelyn, from whom Carnedd Llywelyn gets it's name.\nBera Bach:\nAt 807m, this summit, our fifth, may be one of the most geologically interesting in the Carneddau, with rock stacks and shards shooting off in multiple directions. Scrambling to the top is good fun, provided the rocks are dry.\nDrosgl:\nAt 758m, our final summit may be the shortest, however may offer the most spectacular views. If the visibility is good we'll be able to see all along the North Wales coast and even as far as the Isle of Man.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants. If we do see them, make sure not to approach too closely, as they are wild and shouldn't be frightened.\nOther Information:\nSunday Walk:\nIf you want to make a weekend of it, come and join the Sunday walk to Aber Falls.\nAber Falls via The North Wales Pilgrim's Way | OutdoorLads\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility.

    "Summary": "Join us for a walk from Wilmslow along the valley of the River Bollin!\nThe route takes us through Styal Woods to Morley Green at the far end of the woods, and back again, using different paths.  This is a circular walk of 9 miles / 14.5 kilometres, with 265 metres of ascent.  There are plenty of steps and slopes as we clamber up and down the river valley.  Riverside woodlands are the main feature of this walk, plus Quarry Bank Mill – a cotton mill, built almost 250 years ago, in the Cheshire countryside.  The walk starts and finishes in the centre of Wilmslow, so is easily accessible by train from Manchester and from the south.\nWilmslow\nis a small town lying in the valley of the\nRiver Bollin\n.  It developed from a small village after the coming of the railway in the 1840s.  Only 11 miles/ 18 kilometres from Manchester city centre, it has become a popular residential  location for commuting into Manchester.  In the last fifty years it has developed a reputation for affluence, becoming the hometown of a number of northern media personalities and Manchester footballers.\nStyal\nis a small village, also sited near the River Bollin, and around 2 miles / 3.2 kilometres north-west of Wilmslow.  Styal is where industrialist\nSamuel Greg\nbuilt\nQuarry Bank Mill\n, a cotton mill, in the 1780s.  The mill was situated on the bank of the river to use waterwheels to power the weaving of cotton fabric.  By the 1820s, the mill was expanding and Samuel Greg constructed new housing and other facilities for his growing workforce. It closed as a working factory in 1959 and is now owned by the National Trust, which maintains it as a working industrial museum.\nMorley Green\nis a rural area lying above the Bollin valley and close to Manchester Airport.  Comprising a number of farms and individual cottages, it's the turning point on this walk.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs are welcome on the walk, but must be under control at all times and on a lead when walking through fields with livestock or where wildlife might be disturbed.  We are likely to encounter a lot of other dogs on this walk - it's popular dog-walking territory!\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPhoto credits\n: photos by the event leader with permission given to OutdoorLads for their use.",

An excellent opportunity to explore and admire the flora and fauna as the season of spring takes hold !\nStarting at the Moses Gate Country Park, we will wander through the parks around the lakes, and onto the canal towpaths. After venturing through Nob End and admiring the local statues and bridges, we will move onto Clifton for lunch. This area offers so much wildlife and became a\nSite of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)\nin 1988.\nWe will make our return journey back after venturing around Clifton Country Park, lake, and the River Irwell Sculpture Trail.\nThis is an easy walk - approximately\n8\nmiles\n.\nBolton’s largest nature reserve\nAt 750 acres this is Bolton’s largest nature reserve. Home to mill lodges, woodland and plenty of heritage, wildlife meets industry in a peaceful site where there is always something to see.\nWhat can you see at Moses Gate Country Park?\nDuring the 19th century Moses Gate was home to Farnworth Paper Mills, and under Thomas Bonsor Crompton, it became one of the biggest paper producers in the whole country. At this time the river was so dirty from heavy industry that the water couldn’t be used for paper making and, as a result, ‘Crompton’s Lodges’ were built. Nowadays these lodges support a wide range of waterfowl including mute swan, tufted duck, great-crested grebe and even water rail, while common terns perform acrobatics above the water during summer.\nTime your visit right and you might witness herons catching brown trout as they leap from the weir, and don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the jewel-like kingfisher - the perfect representative of the revival of the valley from industrial dereliction to wildlife haven.\nThe History of Moses Gate Country Park\nThe influence of the industrial revolution can still be seen in the huge 'blue wall' that holds up the canal on the east side of the river, as well as in the woodland. Just 40 - 50 years old, the trees are a reminder that it isn't long since Moses Gate Country Park was an unpleasant mish-mash of coal mines, sewage works, bleach works, paper mills and even a landfill.\nBut the history of this reserve doesn't stop at the industrial revolution. Red sandstone rock outcrops are interesting remnants of the last ice age.\nWell-behaved, socialised and under-control dogs are welcome on this event.\nDogs must be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted and whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. It's a good idea to check what the route may be like with the event leader before booking to find out more about the potential suitability of the walk for dogs.\nAll photos taken by the event leader\nWaitlist\n: If this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Inkpen Hill is part of the North Wessex Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The hill's geological significance lies in its chalk composition, which has shaped the landscape over millions of years.

    "Summary": "This is a fairly short but hilly walk of about 8km (5 miles) with quite a lot of ascent and some steep climbs. It is part of the natural ridge that winds across south-east London from Shooter's Hill to Sydenham Hill and out westwards towards Denmark Hill.\nIt is a prosperous area; a landscape of handsome Victorian and Edwardian houses, fine parks and green spaces where, in ancient times, castles and fortresses were built. In Napoleonic times a string of Telegraph stations were placed along the ridge to convey news from the battlefield or ship movements in the channel where television and radio masts are now placed.\nNunhead\nis one of the 'magnificent seven' Victorian cemeteries in London. At 52 acres, it is the second largest; a Local Nature Reserve containing the grade II listed East Lodge and 'Scottish Political Martyrs' memorial inspired by the French Revolution to campaign for greater democracy. There are also many First and Second World War Commonwealth war graves and memorials.\nAncient woodlands once stretched across the hills and commons of South London.\nOne Tree Hill\nwas saved from development into a private golf course by mass protest and occupation for several years. Eventually, London County Council bought the land in 1905 and declared it a public space.\nThe highpoint of the walk is\nForest Hill\nat 106m above sea level, the 16th highest point in London. It has remarkable panoramic views from Shooters Hill and Eltham, the Crystal Palace transmitter popping up between houses, Battersea Power Station and Wembley Stadium.\nThe walk ends at the\nHorniman Museum\n. Opened in 1901, it houses one of the most significant ethnographic collections in the UK; some  80,000 objects from around the world. The museum includes beautiful gardens and a stunning glasshouse. Entry is free with donation.\nDogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead when required and under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked, please\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

    "Summary": "Join Paul on this leisurely bike ride from Manchester to Bolton and back.\nEveryone (including beginners) is welcome. No one will get left behind. We'll ride at a gentle pace of 8 to 10 miles per hour for about 3 hours, but the event timing is longer to allow for the natural stops and starts of the ride, plus a short lunch stop in Bolton.\nThere are frequent trains between Bolton and Manchester, so there's the option of leaving/joining the ride in Bolton if you fancy a shorter cycle of less than 2 hours. If joining us from Bolton, please book onto the event as usual, then message our ride leader Paul for details of where to meet and the approximate meeting time.\nRoute information\nStarting from Central Manchester, we will ride along National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 55 to Bolton. This follows roads with cycle lanes as far as Eccles (or there's a slightly longer off-road option along canal paths and dedicated cycle paths). We'll then use the quiet roads in the leafy suburb of Ellesmere Park to get to Monton. There we join the former Monton Green to Bolton Railway line, known as the Roe Green loop line which keeps us mainly off road until we reach the centre of Bolton.\nOur return leg continues mainly off road to NCN Route 6 and the Outwood Trail, another former railway line running between Radclliffe and Prestwich. After passing through Drinkwater Park to the outskirts of Salford, we will keep following NCN Route 6 (which has on and off road options) back to the centre of Manchester.\nAlthough most of the route is traffic free or on quieter roads, we may encounter the odd busy road. There will also be some fairly gentle climbs along the way. See the\nlocation\nsection below for a link to the proposed route map and elevation chart.\nThe terrain is best suited to hybrid or mountain bikes, though it can be done on a road bike. Some parts of the trail are uneven and can be muddy if wet. Please check that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise on the day.\nWeather Conditions\nCold, wet and windy weather conditions aren't conducive to sociable cycling, and part of the route has been known to flood after very heavy rain. So, if the weather forecast for the day indicates extreme conditions, the event may be postponed with as much notice as possible provided to participants.\nKeep in Touch\nYou can view a list of upcoming cycling events at\nCycling Events | OutdoorLads\n.

Walbury Hill, on the North Downs, is on the ancient boundary of what are now Hampshire and Berkshire; as such it has several anthropic features such as barrows and more recently gallows. The near-by Inkpen Hill is the start of the Wayfarer's Walk which follows the summit of the Downs, before cutting across Hampshire to Portsmouth Island.\nOur walk will be part on the summit of the downs, but mainly on the undulating landscape to their south.  Starting near Walbury Hill, we'll head west along the Wayfarer's and the follow a pretty broad ridge south into an idyllic rural valley.  After following the valley for a short while, we climb steeply and head for the small village of Faccombe, with it's manor house (alas, not a hall) and the Jack Russell Inn. Lunch will be on the green by the duck pond, with maybe a quick call at the aforementioned inn before we head back up onto the summit of the downs. Returning to the start we'll take in Pilot  Hill - the highest in Hampshire.\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and we will be walking through fields containing livestock.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nIf you haven't been before,\nplease fill out the Depot waiver.\nOn the day just turn up, and find one of the leaders, who will be wearing red ODL t-shirts, and they'll get you on the walls safely in no time.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nIf you've done it before and are confident to boulder without any help, please sign up\nhere\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

You're in the right place, our leader will show you the ropes and you'll be climbing the crags in no time.\nTrad climbing involves placing your own protection on the crag as you climb. We will set up bottom ropes at the crag (similar to what you find at indoor climbing walls) and each climber will also tie into a second rope that will act as a simulated lead rope with which to clip into the protection that they place.  This provides a very safe introduction to trad climbing techniques.  In order to join this event you should have experience of climbing indoors. If you're not sure if this event is for you then please message the leader and they will be happy to advise.\nIf you are already an experienced trad climber and just want to climb independently then please sign up to\nOutdoor Climbing- Experienced Trad\n.  We are also offering\nOutdoor Climbing - Sport\n.\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Outdoor climbing is a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and get out in the fresh air.  This event will allow you to develop your climbing skills in the beauty of one of the renowned gritstone crags of the Peak District, which is our oldest National Park.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The number of spaces available for seconds will be determined by the number of experienced lead climbers that sign up.\nIf you do not quite have this much experience - perhaps you have been out on trad a couple of times or are an experienced sport climber looking to make the jump - then drop me a message and I will see if we can accommodate this. It\nmay\nbe possible to offer a\nlimited number\nof these spaces depending on there being sufficient independent climbers in attendance that are happy to supervise.\nIf you have less experience, but still want to give trad a go, then take a look at the\nbeginner trad session\nrunning alongside this event. Alternatively, we are also organising a\nsport climbing event\non the same day.\nEquipment\nNo equipment will be provided.\nAt a minimum you should have standard personal kit for trad:\nHarness and shoes\nHelmet (this is mandatory and you will not be allowed to participate without one)\nBelay device and locking carabiner - must be suitable for half ropes i.e. not a Gri Gri!\nNut key\nPrusik loop (for abseil backup etc.)\nLocation\nWe will meet at the car park (see below), alongside the beginner group, and choose an area of the crag depending on the ambitions of the group.\nPlease message the event leader when signing up with an idea of your experience and what additional equipment you will be bringing (racks, ropes etc.)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Check out all the events over the weekend of 4-6 April 2025:\nOutdoorLads.events/APR25\n. Great for new and regular members!\nThis sociable leisure ride broadly follows the Manchester and Salford Relief Route (also known as the inner ring road) around the outskirts of Manchester City Centre, with its fascinating mix of architectural heritage.\nWe'll pass striking examples of Victorian engineering, from the imposing warehouses and textile mills that powered Manchester’s industrial boom to the remnants of intricate canal systems, which once transported goods across the city. We'll also see how the city has repurposed its heritage buildings, such as old mills and railway viaducts, transforming them into vibrant spaces for living, working, and leisure.\nAmid the urban sprawl, we’ll encounter numerous green spaces, each with its own story to tell about the city’s evolution. We’ll also discover that, for a city 35 miles from the sea, there’s a surprising amount of water. Our route crosses three rivers and four canals, offering glimpses of the historic waterways that played a crucial role in shaping Manchester’s development.\nWe'll ride at a gentle pace of around 8-10 miles per hour for about 90 minutes, but the event timing is longer to allow for the many natural stops and starts of the ride, plus a short refreshment stop if we want. As always, no one will get left behind.\nThere will be some fairly gentle climbs along the way (which can be walked up if preferred). We will mainly be riding on off road trails, quieter roads and cycle lanes, with surfaces that are suitable for all bike types. There are some sections where caution may be required if you have a road bike with narrow tyres.\nIf you're not a regular cyclist, please make sure your bike is in good condition - check the tyres are well inflated, chain is oiled, and you've got a spare inner tube, drinks and snacks with you.\nWeather Conditions\nCold, wet and windy weather conditions aren't conducive to sociable cycling.

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful.\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome. If you're new to climbing, we've got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity. I keep our group tight-knit to foster connection and ensure personalised coaching for everyone, regardless of your experience level. Many climbers started their journeys relatively “late” in life, incl. some session leaders 🤫\nWe convene at the\nClimbing Hangar in Reading\n, one of the largest climbing centres in the region. The generously spacious and friendly cafe/lounge is my personal favourite where you can find us socialising, having a cuppa, snacks or even pizza before and after the climbs.\nIf you have never climbed at the Climbing Hangar in Reading before, you must book an induction slot:\nhttps://www.theclimbinghangar.com/locations/reading\n- follow instructions to book an induction slot around the time that this event starts.\nYou also need to\ncomplete the waiver form that is linked in the confirmation email\nonce you've booked an induction slot.\nThis only needs to be done once.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Paul for this sociable leisure cycle around Manchester\nThis repeat of a popular event that we did towards the end of last year is especially aimed at beginners who are new to cycling or new to OutdoorLads. Anyone else who hasn't ridden for a while and wants to get back in the saddle is also very welcome. Most of the route is traffic free or on quieter roads.\nThe regal theme to our ride starts as we head south east from the city centre into Victoria Park. Locals will of course know that Victoria Park isn't actually a park. Bearing the name of our second-longest reigning monarch Queen Victoria, this green suburb of Manchester is renowned for it's historical significance and diverse community. We'll pass several historic listed buildings including the Plymouth Grove Hotel, Elizabeth Gaskell's House and Victoria Baths.\nWe'll then use the Fallowfield Loop (former disused railway line) to head over to Alexandra Park, one of Manchester's earliest and most complete Victorian parks. The park was named in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the wife of Prince Albert Edward, who later became King Edward VII.  Originally known as \"The People's Park\", Alexandra Park opened in 1870, inspired by the belief that access to nature and open spaces was vital for the physical and mental health of Manchester's residents. From there we'll have a relatively short ride along a dedicated cycle route back to our start point in the city centre.\nNot got a bike, no problem.\nHire bikes are available from multiple locations around the city, including several that are close to our start point. Make sure to download the\ncycle hire app\nbeforehand, and allow enough time in case you need to try more than one location to find an available bike. The ride is less than 10 miles and will take 60 to 90 minutes to complete at a gentle pace. Based on this timing, hiring a bike should cost no more than £5.00 (or £10.00 for an e-bike). We would recommend purchasing a bundle of time in advance as this will be cheaper than the pay as you go option (especially if hiring an e-bike). Don't forget you will still need to bring a helmet as Outdoorlads requires you to wear one.\nWeather Conditions\nCold, wet and windy weather conditions aren't conducive to sociable cycling. So, if the weather forecast for the day indicates extreme conditions, the event may be postponed with as much notice as possible provided to participants.\nPace and Terrain\nThis will be a leisurely cycle suitable for all levels of fitness. We will try to keep moving, but there are plenty of natural breaks which will give you the chance for a breather. The route is flat all the way round and the terrain is level so it will be fine for all bike types.\nIf you're not a regular cyclist, please make sure your bike is in good condition - check the tyres are well inflated, chain is oiled, and you've got a spare inner tube, drinks and snacks with you.\nJoin us for other upcoming cycling events:\nSaturday 19 April:\nAll Hale the Transpennine Trail (Liverpool)\nSaturday 26 April:\nOutwood Bound (Manchester)\nSaturday 3 May:\nMini Tour de Greater Manchester (Manchester)\nSaturday 17 May:\nCode Breakers' Escape to the Grand Union (Milton Keynes)\n- Link for this one will go live soon\nSunday 18 May:\nCallander to Killin (Stilringshire)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event.",

    "Summary": "Fancy a challenging walk whilst experiencing some of England’s most beautiful landscapes, history and natural beauty? Then this is for you!\nKent is known as the garden of England. This walk is timed to see the beautiful orchards and blossoms of Kent as the flowers come out. The walk follows public footpaths up and down through hills and vales, across orchards and woods, taking in the very best of the Kent countryside. The ups and downs add up to 500m ascent, but there are no very steep slopes on this walk. We will take a moderate pace, but we will not rush. The walk is a mixture of rolling countryside, challenge, and sheer beauty!\nFirst, we follow paths by Selling church, with its medieval stained-glass windows, set on a hilltop above the orchards. From there, we second Hobgens Hill on grassy tracks and through woodland to the edge of Lees Court before turning to Perrywood Hills. On top is the Mount, the highest point in the area at 150m, with a wooden stockage viewpoint amongst the trees on the top. This is also known as the Pulpit, and has good views across Kent. We will find a suitable place to stop for lunch here. Please bring a packed lunch.\nIn the afternoon, we head through woods and over vales, then pick up Mountain Street, an ancient road and hamlet with fifteenth-century houses. This borders Chilham Castle estate with its ancient oak trees, and has great views of the River Stour and Julieberry Downs. We’ll then enter historic Chilham, with its timber frame houses and Castle. There is a toilet block, pub and tearoom, which we may make use of for a short afternoon break. The Castle is a Jacobean manor house, built in striking hexagonal shape by Sir Dudley Digges, a friend of William Shakespeare.\nThe best of the orchards are on the hillsides above Chilham on our afternoon route. We pass Martens Oast, a renovated oast house. Oast houses are distinctive historic buildings with pointed white tops. They are kilns to dry hops for the brewing process. We then return to Selling station through more orchards.\nYou are very welcome to attend this event whether a long-time member or new to OutdoorLads.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome. Be aware that it's possible one or two fields might have livestock in them.\nWhat is SE500?\nSE500 is a proposed series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement? Along the way, see some of the South East’s most beautiful countryside, dramatic hills and natural panoramas along the way. Look out for more of these walks around the South East over the coming months!\nImage Credits\nChilham, Kent, Photo ©\nnicksarebi\n(cc-by-sa/2.0)\n; Stone Stile Oasthouse, Kent, Photo ©\nOast House Archive\n(cc-by-sa/2.0)\n; Cherry Orchards at Bentinck Farm ©\nMark Lindsay-Bayley\n(cc-by-sa/2.0)\n; Chilham Castle\nIn Memoriam: Mark Kilner\n(cc-by-sa/2.0)\n; Perrywood Pulpit\nDavid Neale\n(cc-by-sa/2.0)\n; These images are copyrighted but are here credited to their copyright holders and are licensed for reuse under either Creative Commons CC-BY-SA/2.0.

    "Summary": "Join Dan and OutdoorLads for a quiet weekend in the North Lakes!\nNewlands Valley\nOriginally called Rogersat or Rogersyde (derived from the Old Norse “Roger-Saetr”,\nSummer pasture belonging to Roger\n)\nthe Newlands Valley is one of the most picturesque and peaceful in the Lake District, with the settlements Keskadale, Skelgill, Birk Rigg, High Snab and Uzzicar all having their name origins from early Viking settlers.\nAfter a draining of the large marshy and swampy land at the foot of the valley between Portinscale and Braithwaite in the 13th century made it usable, the more modern name of \"Newlands\" came into being.\nAlong with its natural beauty the valley is home to one of the Lakes most famous mines, Goldscope, on the lower slopes of Hindscarth, and operated from the 16th to the end of the 19th century. It yielded such large amounts of lead and copper that it was called “Gottesgab” (God's Gift) by the German miners brought over to develop the mine in its early days.\nOur accommodation\nThis great little Lake District hostel is nestled in the quiet Newlands Valley, in the shadow of Cat Bells, Hindscarth, Robinson and Dale Head. The hostel itself is compact but well equipped, with a large kitchen, large boot/drying room, three dormitories and toilet/wash facilities. There's a nice common space for us to use that will lend itself well to decent conversation and board games!\nPlease note: Attendees will need to bring their own bedding (sleeping bags and pillowcases)\nItinerary\nFriday Evening -\nArrive at the hostel from 4pm and get settled in. A buffet supplied by everyone will be our evening meal (please bring something that can feed 1-2 people, it doesn't need to be complicated), followed by a welcome briefing from the Leader.\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast of cereals/toast/fruit will be available, and we will be looking to put on two, or possibly three, big walks for the day, depending on available Leaders and weather conditions. For a more relaxed day there is also the lovely town of Keswick and Derwent Water on our doorstep.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop the feet up and unwind from the day's activities. We will be putting together a two-course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided for once ,then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am. At this point some of our number may wish to return home while others may want to enjoy another smaller walk or visit to Keswick.\nWe are very sorry, but unfortunately Stair Cottage does not accept dogs. I know, I'm sad too.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Plus, we can go paddling in the sea and have a leisurely stroll along the miles of golden sand.\nOn Saturday evening we will aim to have a\nfire on the beach and my infamous Big Gay Musicals Quiz !\nDogs\nWell behaved dogs are welcome, but must be\nkept on a\nlead at all times\nand owners must clean up after them.

Heading up the newly made path running beside the road leading to the Grade I listed Stanmer House that once housed a mistress of King George. Stanmer has a church, St. Laurence, next to the pond built circa 1838 and features a donkey wheel to retrieve water from the adjacent well.\nWalking through Stanmer village we head up through Millbank Wood then Moons Wood both of which played home to secret underground demolition squads during the Second World War. These men were the last resort in dire times and would demolish railway lines and bridges if the country was invaded.

This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

    "Summary": "Come and explore the Waterfall Country at the heart of the Brecon Beacons. Nestled into the southern slopes of the Fforest Fawr Massif, west of Merthyr Tydfil, Waterfall Country is one of the most beautiful and popular parts of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark, with steep, tree-lined gorges and an abundance of tumbling water.\nKnown in Welsh as Coed-y-Rhaeadr (Wood of the Water), Waterfall Country lies within the triangle formed by the villages of Hirwaun, Ystradfellte, and Pontneddfechan, where old red sandstone and a long belt of outcrop limestone have created a highly distinctive environment of wooded gorges, caves, swallow holes and waterfalls.\nOur campsite for the weekend is situated on the hillside above the Afon Hepste and very close to the spectacular four best known Ystradfellte waterfalls of,  Sgwd Clun-Gwyn (Falls of the White Meadow), Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn (Lower White Meadow falls),\nSgwd y Pannwr (Falls of the Woolen Washer) and the iconic Sgwd Yr Eira (Falls of Snow) where you traverse the naturally carved path behind the thunderous curtain of water.\nOn the Saturday I will be leading a 16km waterfalls walk from the campsite, taking in not only these spectacular four waterfalls, but also an additional four named waterfalls, as well as numerous cascades along the route.\nIf you don’t fancy joining us for our walk and/or want to do your own thing, there is always the option to just relax at our campsite with views overlooking the scenic Welsh countryside, or perhaps drive to one of the local attractions such as  Penderyn Distillery visitor centre (15 mins), Mountain Biking at Bike Park Wales (35 mins) or the National Showcaves Centre for Wales (25 mins).\nDogs\n: Dogs are welcome on the campsite but you will be expected to be considerate of other campers and clear up behind them.  There may be sheep in adjacent fields so please take this into account if you are thinking of bringing your dog, which will need to be under control at all times when on the site.\nCampervans, Motorhomes\n: Whilst this event is primarily a camping event, it should be possible to cater for these, but please be aware that the surrounding roads are not ideal for wider/longer vehicles.  Please message the leader to discuss.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The ferry is included in the event price.\nFind out more...\nYou can read more about the island and its history on the\nNational Trust's website\nand on\nWikipedia.\nThe\nNational Trust's access leaflet\nincluding a map is also available.\nDogs\nSadly dogs are not allowed on the island nor in the hostel.  If you need to bring an assistance dog for a disability please let us know so this can be arranged.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense? Apply for a place on this event through the OutdoorLads Foundation! Nobody apart from staff members will know and we don't need lots of financial info from you either.

Great for new and regular members!\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event is now fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nFollowing\nPart\nI, we take another trip around central London exploring my favourite Art Deco buildings and other architectural delights along the way. I'm by no means an expert, but I do love Art Deco and different styles of architecture and I will endeavour to provide some background about each building from my own research. We'll also pass a number of historic monuments and other notable places of interest.\nWaiting List\nPlease note, I am limiting the group size to 20, as central London will be busy and these types of walks are easier to manage with a smaller group. I will also be organising Part III of this walk at a later date.\nWalking route and itinerary\nThis is a\nlinear walk\nstarting at\nKing's Cross Station\nand ending near\nOxford Circus underground station.\nThis\nroute\nmap\ncan be viewed in OS Maps, but is for guidance only and is subject to change. The exact route may change on the day due to construction work.\nAfter a short introduction to Art Deco our first building is directly next to us - the mighty Gothic red brick,\nSt Pancras Station and former Midland Grand Hotel (1868)\n. We'll have a look at its intricate exterior and pop inside to briefly admire its single span roof, the largest enclosed space in the world in 1868. Stepping outside, we'll cross Euston Road and head towards Bloomsbury. Our next architectural gem is the\nThe Brunswick Centre (1972)\n, a brutalist housing and shopping complex. We'll briefly stop for refreshments, before continuing to\nRussell Square Underground Station (1906)\nadmiring its stunning Leslie Green burgundy facace. Our first Art Deco building the magnificent former\nDaimler Car Hire Garage (1931)\nand in my opinion one of the finest looking art deco buildings in London.\nNext we walk through Bloomsbury Square towards our second art deco building - the mighty\nSenate House (1937)\n, now home to the University of London. We'll pass through its art deco foyer and, then head to a 60s icon that dominates the skyline - the one and only\nBT Tower (1964)\n. From here we'll cross back over Euston Road, and walk up the Hampstead Road. Our third art deco masterpiece is the very handsome Greater London House or the former\nCarreras Cigarette Factory (1928)\n, which has been beautifully restored. From here we head towards\nRegents Park\nwhere we'll stop for an hour for lunch.\nNext we head out of the park and cross the Euston Road once again and stop at our fourth art deco building the\nRoyal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) (1934)\nbuilding on Portland Place. Its a short walk to the next art deco building, the famous\nBBC Broadcasting House (1932)\n. After we navigate across the busy Oxford Circus, well head to our fifth and final art deco building, the former\nNational Radiator building (1929)\nor Palladium House now.\nAfterwards\nOptional drinks in Soho for anyone who wishes to join me.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome.

    "Summary": "This event is intended for those who have not wild camped before and want to build experience on a relatively easy route in the South Downs, before trying something more advanced. The event runs from Saturday lunchtime to Sunday lunchtime, so you only need to carry sufficient food for an evening meal on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday morning.\nWe’ll meet in the pub for lunch on Saturday and there will be an opportunity to discuss the route and answer any questions. The walk on Saturday afternoon will be around 8 miles (13 km) and will take around four hours. Before dark we’ll find somewhere discrete to camp, far from habitation and away from the main paths. This will be likely in woodland. We can discuss the factors to bear in mind when choosing a suitable wild camp site.\nOut of respect for the environment, we will not light a fire or use portable barbecues at our camp. After a hopefully good night’s sleep, on the Sunday morning we’ll pack up camp, making sure that we leave absolutely no trace. We’ll take different route back to the start, which will also be around 8 miles (13 km). We should be back at cars by lunchtime, and anyone who wants to can stay for a celebratory drink and Sunday lunch in a pub (probably the Bridge Inn in Amberley).\nYou can find out more about Wild Camping in the booklet accessible from here:\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-wild-camping-event\nOptional reading list:\nWild Camping: Exploring and Sleeping in the Wilds of the UK and Ireland by Stephen Neale\nThe Book of the Bivvy by Ronald Turnbull\nHow to Sh*t in the Woods, An Environmentally Sound Approach to a Lost Art by Kathleen Meyer\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring events mean lots of new and existing members excited to be getting out more. Please only book if you know you can make it. Should your plans change please free up the space immediately for someone else who could attend.\nCan I bring my dog?\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, although while we are camping and cooking it's important to be considerate of the other campers. A dog off its lead must be under control.\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times (see\nCountryside walking with your dog\n).\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, then feel free to message me or read the\nMy First Event\npage.\nImage / photo credits:\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n:\n©\nDave Spicer\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/2142327\n©\nPeter Trimming\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/5089726\n©\nDave Spicer\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/2142235\n©\nRichard Law\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4590497\n©\nIan Cunliffe\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7121476\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Date": "Saturday Jun 14 2025",

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "40",
    "Summary": "Note: Please only join this event if you're happy to pay £5 to visit Lowfield Heath Windmill (pay closer to the day of the walk or on the day itself).\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\n...And other such aeolian/barometric clichés about success. The two main selling points of this walk are a private tour of Lowfield Heath Windmill, a Grade-II listed post mill of 1737, and a stretch at the end of Gatwick's runway where the planes seem to brush one's scalp as they ascend. Charlwood has over 80 listed buildings, including a church with extensive wall paintings from 1350, and central to which is a ghostly depiction of 'The Three Living and The Three Dead'. Upmarket suburbanisation and the roar of planes gaining or losing height may have erased most feeling of the past, but the views, woods and fields are charming, the low-flying planes exciting and what history remains, fascinating.\nThe sights:\nCapel:\n'One long and rather nondescript street along the [old] Worthing Road, a mixture of Weald cottages and the cheerful C19 brick of hamlets like Holmwood' (Ian Nairn:\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n). St John Baptist Church is C13, but rebuilt in 1865. Lots of good Weald farms from the C16 and C17.\nCharlwood:\n'A Weald village on the Sussex border, near Crawley New Town (and now even nearer to Gatwick...). Plenty of old cottages remain, both tile-hung and timber-framed, but the remoteness and sense of place have gone' (Nairn). St Nicholas Is Norman, with a C13 aisle and windows. Grade I-listed. Wall paintings from c.1350, which include the story of 'The Three Quick (Living) and the Three Dead' in which three proud young kings meet three skeletons as a\nmemento mori\n. A common Black Death-era trope and now quite faded. Large medieval rood screen.\nLowfield Heath Windmill:\nThe website says: 'The survival of Lowfield Heath Windmill is almost as remarkable as the story of its restoration in the hands of a dedicated and committed group of local people. The Mill was originally built at Lowfield Heath in 1737-8 and now stands on the edge of Charlwood village [it was moved when Gatwick's runways were extended]. It took thirteen years of hard work and great skill to dismantle, repair and re-erect the Mill. It has four floors, with an external staircase leading to the second floor, from where internal ladders rise to two further floors. It also has a small visitor centre within the roundhouse.' The windmill isn't normally open on the day of the walk but I have arranged with the manager for him to open it for us and provide tours in shifts during our lunchtime.\nGatwick Airport:\nThe second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow, and the eighth busiest in Europe. It covers a total area of 674 hectares (1,670 acres). 'Gatwick' was from a farm, long lost, meaning 'goat farm'. The airport opened as an aerodrome in the late 1920s, and it has been in use for commercial flights since 1933, becoming a major airport in 1958. The airport has two terminals, North Terminal and South, and a single-runway which is 3316 metres long. A subsidiary runway is available but, due to its proximity to the main one, can only be used if the main runway is not in use. In February 2025, the government announced plans to move the secondary runway by 12 m north and open it to continuous use. Planes currently take off and land alternately. Although Gatwick is reportedly one of the worst in the UK for watching planes landing and taking off, a footpath we'll follow will allow great views.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll head east from Ockley Station along Coles Lane and cross the A24 in two goes as there is a wide grassy central reservation. We'll then follow The Street to Capel church where we'll proceed along Vicarage Lane. At Temple Lane we'll turn south before turning east and using footpaths to go from Aldhurst Farm to Tanhurst Farm. At the Rusper Road we'll continue east along Duke's Road. At Boothlands Farm, we'll pick up Charlwood Lane, then Russ Hill Lane to go to the windmill for lunch. At Charlwood Church we'll veer round and follow a path south, almost to Ifield. At Ifieldwood we'll follow a path west to The Manor Farm then Langhurst Farm almost to Rusper. Capel Road and then footpaths past Lyne Farm and Pleystowe Farm will take us north back to Capel where we'll walk down Coles Lane back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them (unless the weather is really hot), but there will be some stiles, busy roads and fields with sheep and cattle. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nIMPORTANT!

You can join one of our smaller new member camps, led by some of our amazing, approachable volunteers, who'll help introduce you to others on the first evening. You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent.\nSign up >\nChat Group\nJoin our chat group on Telegram to catch up with others attending BIG Spring Camp, arrange lift shares, share photos etc.\nOutdoorLads.events/BSC25Chat\nVolunteering\nOutdoorLads is built upon people volunteering, and BIG Spring Camp is no exception! This event's success is dependent on volunteers stepping forward to help it run.  We have our BIG Events Team, who's primary purpose of being at the event is to help out. But, we also need additional volunteers to help out with with registration, car parking, bar work, and food service / kitchen portering. Volunteering is a great way to get to know others at the event, as you'll talk to so many people throughout your shift. Once we know exactly what we need and when, we'll be asking for volunteers to come forwards.\nCampsite Information\nSite Map\nThe camp is in a fantastic spot near Betws-y-Coed in the Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, North Wales.

Slate mining is a big part of the heritage of North Wales.  There are a number of mines which we explore which offer an intriguing view into the past.\nTeams will journey through tunnels, up and down inclines, into huge chambers and around deep pools. Exploring the artefacts left behind brings to life the bygone age of an industrial life.\nWhat adventures are in store: A short boat journey, cliplines, ziplines, climbs, abseil, waterfall climb and to top it off a vertical clipline up and out the mine back to the surface. A whole day of fun filled adventures.\nPhotos provided by A Day's Adventure and Unsplash.",

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nJoin us for this 11 mile walk from the charming market town of Watlington, nestled at the bottom of the Chiltern Hills.\nWatlington is a beautiful town with independent shops and a Saturday market. It's worth getting there early to wander up and down the High Street, with its old timber framed houses and grab a coffee.\nWe will start from the main car park and walk towards the first climb at Watlington Hill, which is now managed by the National Trust to preserve the natural habitat of wildflowers, mosses, and the wildlife they support such as butterflies and birds. It also has the strange White Mark, designed by a local squire who thought the view of the church from his home would look better if it had a spire on it - so he carved one into the hillside!\nOnce we reach the top of the hill we will pass through the festively named Christmas Common and descend down towards the estate of Wormsley Park, home of the annual Garsington Opera festival.\nWe will then go north and cross over the M40 to reach Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve - this is where the famous cutting in the landscape was made to accommodate the building of the motorway in 1974. The views from the edge of Beacon Hill are stunning on a clear day.\nAfter stopping for lunch it's a descent down to the Ridgeway path which we will follow back into Watlington, where the Spire and Spokes pub will be waiting for a final drink.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome to come along but be mindful not everyone likes dogs as much as you might. As Watlington Hill and Aston Rowant Nature Reserve are managed by the National Trust they do ask dogs to be under strict control in these areas to protect the local wildlife.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It features a mix of historic cottages, a medieval church, and beautiful countryside views.\nThe route\n(see location section for OS link):\nStarting at Pangbourne Station, we will briefly walk through the village centre and then cross the River Thames over Pangbourne Bridge into Whitchurch-On-Thames. We will then head East for a while, and shortly will have a steep uphill climb to join the Chilterns Way, which we will follow along a ridge for some time, through Whitchurch Hill. As we make progress to Goring, then assuming good weather, you will have good views across the Thames Valley towards the Goring Gap. We then progress downhill and eventually arrive at Goring-On-Thames where we will walk through the village, past George Michael's house, and then have lunch on some benches by Goring Lock.\nAfter lunch we will mainly follow the Thames Path, which is one of the best sections in the area. The first part is the usual flat towpath by the river, but sometime after proceeding under Brunel's railway bridge at Gatehampton, the path follows an unusually undulating and wooded section, which rises to somewhat higher points with glimpses of the Thames through the trees, a valley section with a staircase of steps to climb (Hartley Steps) and then follows a quiet country lane back into Whitchurch-on-Thames, where we will walk through the historic village high street, with a possible pub divert, and finally cross the river back to Pangbourne Railway Station.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nAll photos taken by the co leader on different dates over the past 5 years and permission given to OutdoorLads for use.",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "Walk is 19km/12 miles and with a possible Thames Path divert could be slightly longer. Total ascent 211m. Terrain is mainly country lanes & footpaths, which could be muddy in part. The walk has some undulating sections with one very steep uphill climb.",

Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate.

Of course you may wish do your own thing, or break into smaller groups as preferred.\nAn elegant city full of traditional heritage, contemporary culture, green spaces and a few surprises.\nBuilt for pleasure and relaxation, beautiful Bath has been a wellbeing destination since Roman times. The waters are still a big draw today, both at the ancient Roman Baths and the modern Thermae Bath Spa, which houses the only natural thermal hot springs in Britain you can bathe in. Bath’s compact centre is full of places to eat and drink, plus some of the finest independent shops in Britain, making it the ideal city break.\nBath's stunning, honey-coloured Georgian architecture is straight from a Jane Austen novel; highlights include the iconic Royal Crescent and the majestic Circus which we will visit in our guided tour on Saturday morning.\nWhat’s going to happen\nItinerary:\nDay 1:\nArrive at our accommodation at 5pm Friday afternoon, meet & greet reception before heading off out for local dinner and drinks.\nPossibility of a Ghost tour before or after evening dinner :\nBath Ghost Tours - Visit Bath\nDay 2:\nAfter optional breakfast in our accommodation we will head out on a leisurely city walk with a local guide -\nWalks for groups\nThis is followed by an optional afternoon tour of\nBath Abbey\nor visit to the\nAmerican Museum & Gardens\n-\nIn the evening we will reconvene at the hostel before we join up with a local outdoor lads social at\nThe Real Italian Pizza Company.\n.

    "People Attending": "44",
    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\nCome queen of months in company / Wi' all thy merry minstrelsy / The restless cuckoo absent long / And twittering swallows chimney song / And hedge row crickets notes that run / From every bank that fronts the sun / And swathy bees about the grass / That stop wi' every bloom they pass\n(John Clare: 'The Shepherd's Calendar - May')\nStarting a walk at a busy railway station means that the convenience of the trains is offset by the drag of walking along suburban streets before getting to the countryside. Twenty percent of the walk will be through the suburbs of Haywards Heath and not in the marvellous Maytime Wealden countryside, but eighty percent will be. The suburbs do, however, lead to the village of Lindfield 'without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex'. Beyond Lindfield is Danefield (burial place of 'Carry On' actor Peter Butterworth and his wife, the actor and impressionist Janet Brown), a tea shop at a farm, and handsome houses linked by the hedgerow-lined tracks and trails evoked in the poem above.\nThe sights:\nHaywards Heath:\nA Victorian new town started on the site of a Civil War battle in 1642 when the railway arrived in 1841. A dormitory town for commuters to London and Brighton with pleasant housing estates stretching out.\nLindfield:\nAdjoining Haywards Heath but with its own character. 'Without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex' (Pevsner:\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n). (In 1974 relocated to West Sussex.) Around 40 ancient buildings line the high street, around half of medieval origin. 'The alternation of timber-framing and stately Georgian brick is the leitmotif' (Pevsner). Some buildings of note: Church Cottage and Thatched Cottage (C15); Old Place (1590); Lindfield House (C18); Lindfield Place (early C18)...you get the idea. St John Baptist Church is mainly c1300 with shingled broach spire and decorated gothic windows and porch. East Mascalls is a Grade II* listed manor from 1578.\nDanehill:\nNot much of a definite village centre, but a small green near the church where we can have our packed lunches. All Saints Church is 1892, by Bodley and Garner, and is serious and imposing, unlike two of its graveyard's occupants; actors Peter Butterworh (1913-1979) who appeared in most of the Carry On films from 1965 (\nCarry On Cowboy\n) to 1978 (\nCarry On Emmanuelle\n) and his wife Janet Brown (1923-2011) known for impersonating Margaret Thatcher, including in the James Bond film\nFor Your Eyes Only\n(1981). We'll have tea and cake at Heaven Farm, just outside of the village.\nThe\nroute\n(clock the link to see it)\n:\nSydney Road, West Common and Lindfield High Street will take us northeast out of town. We'll then pick up the Sussex Diamond Trail (SDT) which will take us all the way to Danehill, barring a short stretch along Church Lane. After lunch, we'll head south along Church Lane again and then the A275 to Heaven's Farm for tea and cake. The SDT and the Sussex Ouse Valley Way will take us almost back to Haywards Heath but we'll have to use Snowdrop Lane, Lyoth Lane, Gravelye Lane, Westlands Road, Hanbury Lane, Washington Road and Oatlands Avenue generally heading west, then a walk through the park, then Perrymount Road going north to get back fully.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

The aim is to reduce the vigour of bracken, which if left unchecked would smother other flora beneath it.  Without management, grass growth would be suppressed resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Bracken bashing enables flowers such as orchids and common harebells to thrive and to provide nectar sources for bees and butterflies.\nOur day will start with a safety briefing from Forestry England before we are let loose on the bracken.   We'll have a break for some lunch and after a few hours of hard work we'll find a local pub to enjoy a well deserved drink.\nAnd of course there will be cake!\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.\nAs this is a National Trust campsite, the facilities are top-notch with clean and heated showers, and your typical National Trust camp shop.\nWe've reserved a designated 'patch' in the campsite so we'll all be camping together.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome at the campsite, although please note the National Trust's\nrules for dogs as listed on this site\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nWalking from the heaths near Aldershot to the pastures near Farnham will provide contrast. Walking through millennia of history, especially military history, will provide continuity. While the colossal Wellington Monument, the Royal Garrison Church (the 'Army's Cathedral'), an inn where Cromwell stayed before a siege and the hillfort of Caesar's Camp will evoke the clash of arms, the fields of fleecy flocks will instil peace of mind. Literal high-points will be Caesar's Camp (our lunch spot) and Farnham Castle (a freebie, accessible if a masonry issue is resolved), offering stirring views, while the wealth of historic buildings (Plantagenet, Tudor, Georgian, Victorian) will display the pageant of history.\nThe sights:\nEquestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington, Aldershot:\nBy Matthew Cotes Wyatt. In 1846 the largest equestrian statue in Britain. Wellington is shown as Field Marshal astride Copenhagen. 9.1 m tall and 40 tons. It took three years and three tons of Plaster of Paris to sculpt and is made of bronze from melted French cannon. The duke sat for it, but Copenhagen had died by then, so an inferior horse was used as a model. Considered disproportionate to the Wellington Arch which it topped off (Queen Victoria thought it an eyesore too, but it couldn't be removed for fear of offending the Iron Duke), it was removed when the arch was relocated in 1882, and set up in Aldershot in 1885 at the suggestion of the Prince of Wales 'where it might be admired by the army'.\nRoyal Garrison Church of All Saints, Aldershot:\n1863, by PC Hardwick. The home church for the military personnel in Aldershot, known as the 'Army's Cathedral'. There are many memorials to regiments and personnel, and The Somme Cross, made of charred timbers from an obliterated village in the Somme. The church isn't open at weekends apart for services.\nCaesar's Camp:\nA late Bronze Age-Iron Age hill fort and Scheduled Ancient Monument of national importance for its size and completeness inside the defensive rings (it is multivallate). The rings themselves have been much disturbed by military activity and quarrying. The top is 177 m up and gives superb views across the heaths and beyond. The name reflects possible Roman re-use.\nCrondall:\nA large and attractive village originally grouped around a green. Tudor architecture abounds (such as The Plume of Feathers pub in which Cromwell stayed before the siege of Basing House in 1645), as does Georgian architecture. Powderham Castle nearby is a mere mound.\nAll Saint's Church, Crondall:\nFor Betjeman, among the finest in the county and for Simon Jenkins two stars in\nEngland's Thousand\nBest Churches\n. The high brick tower is a rarity, built in the last days of the Commonwealth in 1659. The body of the church is Norman, 12th and 13th centuries. Clerestoried (high-windowed) nave and vaulted chancel. Fine monuments and brasses inside. Parliamentarian forces camped in the churchyard.\nFarnham Castle:\nBuilt in 1138 by Henri of Blois and the home of the Bishops of Winchester for over 800 years. Demolished then rebuilt in the late 12th and early 13th centuries as a massive shell keep on the foundations of a Norman tower. In the early 15th century it was the residence of Cardinal Henry Beaufort. Since then more buildings were constructed in the grounds, the most impressive being those built by Bishop George Morley in the 17th century. The castle is free to enter and set in five acres of parkland and gardens. Positioned on a bluff, it gives fine views over Farnham and the Wey Valley. English Heritage open the Keep for free, but at the time of writing it is closed owing to crumbling masonry.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWalking through the town centre of Farnham we'll soon be at the castle for a 20-minute look around. We'll then walk across northeast the park adjacent to the castle and through the suburbs of Hale to enter the heathlands near Caesar's Camp at Hungry Hill. After crossing these heaths we'll use roads to go to the Royal Garrison Church and the Wellington Monument. We'll then cross back through the heaths, heading southwest and ascend Caesar's Camp to admire the view. After crossing Bricksbury Hill we'll be back at the A325 where a short walk along its pavement which will take us to Redlands Lane and Crondall for a pub stop. A walk through Crondall heading south over Wimble Hill, then northeast, then east along bridleways will lead to the St Swithun's Way which will head back to Farnham to conclude the walk.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIt's tricky trying to schedule walks to coincide with seasonal displays of flowers. Even if we are too early or too late for the famed displays of wild hyacinths (better known as bluebells) that carpet the floor of Slindon Woods, there will be so much else of appeal on this walk that we shouldn't feel cheated. These include: a windmill atop a hill at with a superb view at Halnaker; the ruined priory and serene intact chancel (a church in itself) at Boxgrove; an array of handsome flint farmhouses; and the National Trust-owned village of Slindon itself. If the entire walk of 15 miles is too long for you, you could do all the best bits in just 10.5 miles, and then get a handy bus back to the starting point.\nThe sights:\nSlindon:\nA delightful brick and flint village on the southern slopes of the Downs. Only 70 metres up, but with a glorious view across the Sussex Plain to the sea. It is quite unspoilt, so much so that the National Trust has taken charge of the entire place. St Mary's church is over-restored (1866), but there is a lot of value inside. C11 nave walls and C12 chancel. Mediaeval pews. Monument to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1539), the only wooden effigy in a Sussex church and very well carved. Several fine houses of all ages all around. Nore Folly is just outside the village. A battlemented arch, built 1814, the attached summer house built for shooting luncheons is long gone. Grade II-listed.\nEartham:\nA tiny, unspoilt village of flint and brick in lovely countryside. Eartham House, which we might glimpse, is by Edwin Lutyens and is from 1905. Not one of his more inspired designs.\nHalnaker Windmill:\nOccupying a splendid hilltop site. Built 1750, then restored in 1934, 1955 and 2012. A squat and sturdy brick tower made elegant by an onion dome. Sweeps intact. There is also the base of a World War II HFDF ('Huff-Duff') High Frequency Directional Finding Station, and further off in the field, an ack-ack gun emplacement.\nHalnaker:\nA pleasant straggle of houses along the Roman Stane Street. Old Halnaker House is C14, now ruined, but New Halnaker House is also by Lutyens, of 1938. Very late and heavy. The grounds of the house were used as a filming location for Doctor Who in 1985 for the story\nRevelation of the Daleks,\nstanding in for the planet Necros. The Doctor and Peri ran along then climbed over a flint wall which we'll see.\nBoxgrove:\nContiguous with Halnaker and Tangmere, a small and quiet place considering the size of its church. One pretty main street of the now familiar brick, flint and tile houses. Boxgrove Common Quarry became celebrated in 1993 when the tibia and two teeth of the earliest known member of the genus\nHomo\nfound in the UK was uncovered. Back in 500,000 BC\nHomo heidelbergensis\nwas roaming a coastal shoreline that existed at the time, setting up camp and hunting and butchering horse and rhinoceros.\nBoxgrove Priory:\nThe church of St Mary and St Blaise is rather French-looking with its steeply pitched roofs and flying buttresses. Surrounded by modest monastic ruins. Before the Dissolution in 1538 the old nave, lying to the west, served as the parish church. The huge great chancel is now the parish church. The rhythm of column and vault in it is most satisfying. The delicate floral patterns were painted in the vault spaces in the mid-C16. Another treasure of the church is the De la Warre Chantry of 1532. An exquisite gothic box that takes its design from a C15 French Book of Hours. The architecture is late gothic, but the decoration is a mix of gothic and classical, even including some putti supporting the family crests. The vault is carved pendants. The church is rich in other works of art, including a reredos by George Gilbert Scott and stained glass in an Arts and Crafts style.\nAnd if you do the full walk, you'll also see:\nAldingbourne:\nIn flat cornfields, unsuburbanised and remote. Thatched cottages and the church of St Mary. This is rather fine, C12, in the Transitional Gothic-Early English style. There are two fonts, Norman and Saxon and some faint C13 wall paintings. The size of the church suggests a bigger parish and indeed it was until the Black Death caused migration from the area which was perceived as unhealthy.\nEastergate:\nLike Barnham, heavily suburbanized, but we will pass a quiet and attractive corner. The church of St George is C14 and over-restored. Manor Farm is one of the best farmhouses in the area, c1600, unrestored, half H-shaped. At the back, a big half-timber granary on staddlestones.\nThe bus:\nFor those not doing the full walk, the Stagecoach No. 500 bus leaves Tangmere every 30 minutes at 23 and 53 minutes past. It takes 15 minutes to get to Barnham Railway Station. A single ticket costs £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nThe route\n(see the shorter linear walk with bus back\nhere\n; see the full circular walk\nhere\n)\n:\nWe'll take the mixed-use path north along Barnham Lane from Barnham to Walberton, then West Walberton Lane to Fontwell. We'll use the subway under the A27 and wander through Slindon Woods. Having reached the village itself we will take Top Road briefly then a footpath west past Nore Folly. The footpath will continue west to get to Eartham. We will then cross further west to reach the A285 and take a footpath southwest then north to Halnaker Mill which is where we will have lunch. We will descend the hill, have a slight detour past Boxgrove Common and then walk along the A285 (along the pavement), to take The Street south to Boxgrove and its priory. Then using a footbridge over the A27, we will skirt round Tangmere, and some of our party can catch the bus back.\nThe rest  of the walk uses East Hampnett Lane heading east, then footpaths heading south to get to Aldingbourne. Church Road then Hook Lane heading southeast will bring us to Westergate, then footpaths heading east will bring us to Eastergate, and apart from a brief spell along Church Lane heading east, we will use footpaths all the way back to Barnham Station.\nIMPORTANT!

We will then turn northwards across Cawdle Fen with the cathedral becoming ever more present again as we approach the city.\nOn reaching Ely we will weave along the streets past Oliver Cromwell's house, arriving at the imposing western façade of the cathedral, originally founded by St Etheldreda in the 7th century. After a circuit of the cathedral we will make our way back to the river at the marina where you are welcome to head back to the station, the car park or to a local pub.\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring always means lots of new and existing members excited to be getting back out more.

    "Summary": "The Isle of Wight has a character all of its own, and the rugged south of the island ('The Back') doubly so. The climate is almost subtropical, so glasshouse plants proliferate and bloom outside. The local sandstone is also distinct and so the cottages and churches look more like Dorset than Hampshire.\nThe Wee:\nThe retro Godshill Model Village, with the places we'll be seeing meticulously miniaturised.\nThe Twee:\nThe model village and the cottages orné of Shanklin Old Village - twee, but enjoyably so.\nThe Wowee:\nThe prettiest villages on the island (Godshill and Shanklin Old Village), the highest hill and best view likewise (St Boniface Down)(Plus, the 'aah factor': we'll drop in on the freebie Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary!)\nThe sights:\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary:\nThe\nwebsite\nstates:\n'\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary has 118 donkeys, 1 mule and 22 ponies, all of whom are either rescued or abandoned. They are given a ‘forever home’ in 55 acres of countryside in the Wroxall valley where they get first class care and welfare.' Admission is free but a donation is welcome.\nGodshill:\nThe show village of the island with its mellow church tower rising above immaculate thatched cottages. All Saints Church, mostly 15th-century, perched on a hilltop. Spacious interior adorned with some notable features: Medieval wall-painting of Christ on a 'lily cross' - one of only two in Europe; C18 monuments to the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe; big painting of\nDaniel in the Lions' Den\n, perhaps by Rubens.\nGodshill Model Village\n:\nThe tourist traps of Godshill and Shanklin Old Village reproduced at 1/10th scale. 'You can find all of our houses, cottages, churches and pubs in real life for a proper Gulliver [or Godzilla (Godshilla?)-suited] experience! Our models are fantastic replicas of these real buildings, made with sand and cement so they weather as they age. We even thatch them just like the real thing' (the website). The abundant conifers, trimmed to maintain scale, are equally notable. £7.00 to enter. We'll take the recommended 45 minutes to explore it over lunch, but if it's not your thing, you're welcome to go to the pub or explore the village and miss this quintessentially English piece of quirkiness.\nAppuldurcombe House:\nThe shell of a large and very fine C18 baroque mansion, built 1702-1740 for the Worsley family by John James. Requisitioned by the military and bombed by enemy action in 1943 and left a ruin. Managed by English Heritage. Freemantle Arch, 1770s, perhaps by James Wyatt. We won't be entering the house, just seeing the exterior.\nSt Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down:\nChalk hills rising to 241 metres, the island's highest point, In 1940 the radar station was bombed by Stukas, a scene reconstructed in the film\nThe Battle of Britain\n. Ecologically a rare juxtaposition of calcareous downland and acid grassland-heathland with acid-loving gorse, heather, bell heather and bilberry meeting alkaline-loving juniper and box. The cap of gravel supports a forest of holm oak. The views, south to the sea and north over the island to the mainland are truly stupendous.\nShanklin:\nA popular seaside resort with an esplanade lined with hotels and cafes and a sandy beach occupying a broad bay. The pier was lost in a storm in 1987.\nShanklin Old Village:\nA picturesque cluster of old cottages and Victorian cottages ornés, mostly now cafes, restaurants and touristy shops.\nShanklin Chine\n:\n'Chine' is a local term for a coastal ravine. Shanklin Chine contains waterfalls, trees and lush vegetation, with footpaths and walkways allowing access. Red squirrels are being supported and a section of PLUTO (PipeLine Under The Ocean), installed to supply petrol for the D-Day Landings, is visible. The Chine costs £8.50 to enter and doing so is optional.\nIsland Line Railway:\nNewly refurbished London Underground Class 484 trains (converted from D-78 stock) serve on the Island Line network. These replaced the 82-year-old Class 483 trains from 1938 that served on the island for 32 years until 2020.\nWightlink catamarans:\nHSC Wight Ryder I\nand\nHSC Wight Ryder II\nare high-speed craft in service from 2009. The sun deck makes the sea crossing great fun.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to the Ordnance Survey website to see the ascents and descents):\nShanklin's streets will soon give way to countryside via a converted railway line out to Lower Hyde and beyond. At Winstone Farm we'll leave the old railway and head west to the Donkey Sanctuary. Hitting the Stenbury Trail, we'll go into Godshill where we'll have just over an hour to see the model village and church and have lunch. Footpaths and the Worsley Trail will take us south and east out of Godshill to Appuldurcombe House. Footpaths and Rew Lane will then take us to Wroxall Down via Homelands Pit Farm. We'll cross Wroxall Down out to the antennae and then descend St Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down, heading towards the sea and finally reach Shanklin where an option is to descend Shanklin Chine before returning to the station to go back to Ryde.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on all my walks and this walk has plenty of open countryside and few lanes. However, it is quite long and hilly and may be too demanding for them in hot weather. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join me on a spring walk from the town where I work, Ryde, to my home town of Newport. Meandering through the streets of Ryde until we reach country lanes and disused railway lines - long turned into cycle paths and bridleways - and make our way into Newport.\nThe day will start with “a ticket to Ryde\", taking the Wighlink Fast Cat service from Portsmouth Harbour over to Ryde Pier Head on the Isle of Wight. Once we have docked we will make our way down the recently converted Victorian Tramway, which is now used as a walk way to the shoreline.\nAt the Esplanade we will begin to head east, heading through the back streets of Ryde until we reach the lanes, and bridle paths which link the Victorian seaside town of Ryde with the ferry port of  Fishbourne.\nEn route we will have lunch at Quarr Abbey, a 19th century abbey which along with the surrounding farm is worked by a small group of Benedictine monks. Situated not far from the ruins of the former abbey, which was demolished under the Dissolution of Monasteries Act of 1536. In the grounds there is a very well stocked shop featuring local produce, and a cafe which does good food, and more, importantly coffee and cakes. There is plenty of room to eat a packed lunch on benches around the grounds, and chill while watching the locals feed the abbey's pigs and seemingly endless supply of piglets.\nAfter lunch we will continue on a slight southwest trajectory, heading through Fishbourne, and Wooton (passing the Postal Museum which I didn’t even know existed until I started walking home from work) until we reach Island Harbour. A small marina which is mainly filled with private leisure boats. Rather oddly sitting in an enviable position by the marina, with great views down the River Medina, is the bus from Spice Girls: the Movie, which could make an interesting photo opportunity (and no I haven’t seen that movie either…).\nPassing through the marina we will walk along a bicycle path which runs parallel to the River Medina, and leads us to my home town of Newport. In Newport there should be ample time for a swift half before taking a bus from Newport back to Ryde, or to head straight to Ryde and have a drink there . I aim to get you back to Ryde in plenty of time to catch the 18.45 Fast Cat sailing to Portsmouth Harbour.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them with few stiles and busy roads, but there may be a number of fields with livestock. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "This is an 11.3 km walk around the grounds of the Grade II registered parkland of Blaise Castle estate and the adjacent Kings Weston estate. Situated just to the North West of the City of Bristol, it is easily accessible from M5 Junction 17 and 18.\nCommencing from the car park, we walk across to the 18th century Blaise Castle House Museum, the home of the social history collection.  We then walk down to Stratford Mill and follow the tree lined limestone gorge of Hazel Brook, along which you will find Tarn Lake and Penny Well.  Hazel Brook then joins into the River Trym at Coombe Dingle, and we continue to follow the course of the river through a mix of woodland and grass meadows down to where it meets the River Avon.\nFrom here the route follows the Avon for a short distance before walking along the southern edge of Shirehampton Golf course (be alert for shouts of FOUR!), before heading into the grounds of Kings Weston House, towards Penpole Point.  Travelling back towards the Blaise Castle estate we will lunch beside the 18th century grade 1 listed Kings Weston House, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1712 who also designed Blenheim Palace.  There is a coffee shop here, where you can get yourself a drink or ice cream.\nThe final leg of today’s walk takes us past two follies.  The first of which is at the top of the Kings Weston estate, then passing through hill top limestone meadows and along to an Iron Age hill fort we get to grade II listed 18th century Blaise Castle folly, built by Robert Mylne in 1766 for wealthy Bristol merchant Thomas Farr, which featured in Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey.  The Blaise castle estate was also the backdrop for the village of Avalon in the 2023 Arthurian drama The Winter King.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "45",
    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\nRacier, but also shorter and linear. A rehash of a walk from last Good Friday, but now with more of the famous racecourse. Partly townscape but mostly landscape, the townscape is that of Chichester, a cathedral city of Georgian townhouses, and the landscape is that of the rolling South Downs National Park. We'll go surprisingly deep into the national park and the vistas we'll enjoy will go even deeper. In Chichester, we'll follow a half-circuit of the Roman city walls with views over the historic centre. In the countryside we'll see chalk streams and flint-built villages, and at lunchtime we'll sit on an Iron Age hill fort and survey views across the Weald, across 'Glorious Goodwood', and across the coastal plain.\nThe sights:\nChichester:\nA cathedral city of Roman origin (Noviomagus Reginorum) founded soon after the Claudian invasion of 43 AD. Many Georgian buildings and a thriving arts scene. The chief sights are:\nBishop's Palace Gardens:\nextensive and intricate Tudor gardens overlooking the cathedral;\n'Dutch-style' roundabout:\nOnly Britain's third, where cyclists and pedestrians have priority;\nCity walls:\nOriginally Roman, c200 AD, four metres wide and five metres high in places. 80 per cent complete, making them the most intact circuit of Roman town defences in Southern England;\nChichester Cathedral:\nFundamentally Norman, but modest and friendly in scale. C12 and C13 rebuilds creating beautiful transitional Gothic chancel and retrochoir. Unique but clunky detached bell tower of 1436. Tower and spire (82 m tall) accurately rebuilt in 1861 after collapse by George Gilbert Scott. Interior is almost a gallery of modern art (the cathedral exterior will be seen at a slight distance; we won't be entering);\nChichester Festival Theatre:\nBy Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, 1962, grade II*-listed. Innovative open stage and hexagonal plan. Park location to foster informality and festivity.\nEast Lavant:\nBeside the river with a lovely intricate yet relaxed plan. Brick, flint and thatched cottages and a superb view north to the Downs. St Mary's Church is 12th and 13th century, with a plain brick tower of 1671 and all the rest a Victorian restoration of 1863. We could have a drink at The Royal Oak.\nSt Roche's Hill and the Trundle:\n206 m in elevation. The Trundle (Old English 'Tryndel' or 'circle') is an Iron Age hill fort built around a Neolithic causewayed enclosure. Subsequent history involves a chapel to St Roche (lost), a Civil War encampment and a viewing area to Goodwood Racecourse. There are wonderful views to be had, north over the Weald and south over the Sussex Plain and the Sea.\nGoodwood:\nWe won't see the late C18 stately home and we'll only see the aerodrome, car racing circuit and site of the Goodwood Revival at a distance, but we'll get a grandstand view of the grandstands of the famous racecourse. 'Glorious Goodwood' earned its honorific by being 180m up, and set in sublime countryside. It was laid out in 1801 as a private military racecourse. The current stands are the March Stand of 1980, the Charlton Stand of 1989 and the Sussex Stand of 1990, the latter by Arup Associates. Architect Michael Hopkins designed the paddock area with tent-like structures in 2001. Edward VII called Goodwood 'a garden party with some racing tacked on', and I think the festive feel and beautiful setting confirm his belief.\nCharlton:\nA quadrilateral of lanes lined with flint cottages. Apart from Fox Hall which was built by Lord Burlington (architect of Chiswick House) in 1730 as a hunting lodge for the Charlton Hunt, there are no houses worth special notice and no church. The village is still very pleasant in its setting among wooded hillslopes. It played the fictional Scottish village of Tulloch Moor in the Fourth Doctor Who classic story\nTerror of the Zygons\n. The Fox Goes Free pub (then The Fox Inn) was the base of UNIT operations, and Sarah-Jane Smith and the UNIT soldiers chased the Zygon Harry Sullivan along its lanes until the creature fell from a hayloft on to the pitchfork it was wielding.\nSingleton:\nA tangle of lanes with no special houses, but very pleasant nonetheless. Beautifully maintained. St John the Evangelist church has a Saxon tower and very tall Norman walls, but the details are C13.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link to see the walk at the OS website):\nLeaving the station we will walk around the southwest, northwest and northeast quadrants of the city walls, mostly on the elevated walk promenade, occasionally at street level. We will then descend the walls and cross the Oaklands Way Ring Road to walk past the Festival Theatre. Beyond that Centurion Way cycle path will take us out of the town into the countryside to East Lavant. We'll take the West Sussex Literary Trail to The Trundle. After lunch, we'll descend the hill and take the Monarch's Way alongside the racecourse. Chalk Lane track will take us to Charlton and we'll follow the River Lavant and Charlton Road to Singleton to pick up the bus.\nThe bus journey back\nThe Stagecoach No. 60 bus takes 20 minutes to go from Singleton to Chichester and departs at 21 and 51 minutes past. A single fare is £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, although there will be lots of road walking in town and may be some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a scenic and tranquil walk through the beautiful landscapes surrounding Dulverton, the gateway to Exmoor. This circular route follows the picturesque River Barle, taking in ancient woodlands, historic landmarks, and breathtaking countryside views.\nWe begin our journey in Dulverton, a charming market town nestled on the banks of the River Barle. As we set off, we will pass the iconic Lorna Doone statue, a much-loved local landmark where visitors often place flowers in her bronze hand. From here, we make our way to the medieval Barle Bridge, a five-arched stone bridge that has stood the test of time.\nFollowing the river, we’ll walk along its tranquil banks, skirting Burridge Wood, which sits high above the valley and is thought to be the site of an ancient fort. Our path continues through Syds Wood, Invention Wood, and Buckminster Wood, immersing us in the peaceful ambiance of Exmoor’s enchanting forests. We then head towards Venford Wood and onto Hawkridge Ridge, where the views open to rolling countryside and expansive farmland.\nFrom Hawkridge Ridge, we will cross farmland and quiet country lanes as we make our way back to Dulverton. Around 75% of our route follows the banks of the River Barle, allowing us to fully enjoy the soothing sounds of flowing water and the serenity of the surrounding woodland. The return stretch through open fields and lanes provides a contrasting landscape to complete our day’s adventure.\nWe look forward to sharing this beautiful walk with you and enjoying the camaraderie of like-minded walkers. See you in Dulverton!\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring and Summer walks mean lots of new and existing members excited to be getting out more. Please only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event is fully booked, however, if you'd like to attend,\nadd yourself to the waitlist\n, places often become available closer to the date, and chances are you may still get a place.\nThe western tip of the Isle of Wight is almost an island in itself. The River Yar, which rises a stone's throw from formerly fashionable Freshwater Bay to the south and wends its way to pretty, yachty Yarmouth to the north, nearly parts the peninsula from the rest of the island. West Wight is famed for its dramatic coastline: the chalk cliffs of the southern side seem insuperable until they disintegrate into the jagged fragments of The Needles, while on the northern side, the chalk gives way to the showy, slumping sands of Alum Bay and its beach (accessible by steps or chairlift). West Wight is dotted with forts which will add interest and variety to the beauty of this holiday-in-a-day day walk.\nThe sights:\nYarmouth:\nA small seaside market town, Saxon in origin but with a Norman grid road layout. Yarmouth Castle, built in 1547 by Henry VIII, is a gun platform to defend The Solent. The elegant Town Hall was rebuilt in 1763. In St James' Church there is a monument to the C17 admiral Sir Robert Holmes. He obtained it in a raid on a French ship, when he seized an unfinished statue of Louis XIV of France and forced the sculptor to finish it with his own head rather than the king's. Yarmouth Pier (Grade II-listed), opened 1876, is the longest timber pier in England (186m). You might like to explore the town more thoroughly at the end of the walk; it really is a lovely little place.\nRiver Yar (Western Yar):\nRising a few hundred metres north of the beach at Freshwater Bay, this runs north to Yarmouth. Freshwater Marshes and Afton Marshes are Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Coastal erosion has removed the headwaters of the river and further erosion could eventually cut off its source, turning the river valley into a sea channel and West Wight into an island.\nFreshwater:\nA scattered village which enjoyed some popularity as a Victorian seaside resort (The Albion Hotel is typical) and attracted residents such as the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson and the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Overlooking Freshwater Bay is Fort Redoubt, built in 1855 to guard against a French invasion.\nFreshwater Bay:\nFamous for its geology and rock formations. The bedding planes of the chalk are noticeable, with each one delineated by bands of flint. Arch Rock collapsed in 1992. Stag Rock is so named because a stag leaped on to the rock from the cliff to escape during a hunt. Mermaid Rock became detached from the cliff face in 1968.\nTennyson Down:\nA grassy ridge of chalk rising to 147m above sea level. Named after Lord Tennyson who lived at nearby Farringford House for nearly 40 years. The poet used to walk on the down almost every day. The monument, a Cornish granite Celtic cross, is by JL Pearson, and dates from 1897, five years after Tennsyon's death.\nThe Needles:\nA row of three chalk sea stacks rising 30m out of the sea. The 35m Needles Lighthouse was built in 1859. The adjacent waters and seabed form part of The Needles Marine Conservation Zone. The formation takes its name from a needle-shaped pillar called Lot's Wife which collapsed in 1764. The remaining rocks are not needle-like, but the name has stuck. The Needles were considered by the BBC's\nSeven Natural Wonders\none of the wonders of Southern England.\nThe Needles Batteries and Rocket-Testing Facility:\nTwo heavy gun emplacements built above The Needles to guard The Solent. Old Battery was built in 1861-2, New in 1895 when the Old Battery's cliffs crumbled. In the 1950s the battery was used for testing the Blue Streak missile, as well as the Black Knight and Black Arrow satellite launch vehicles. The rocket testing facilities are a scheduled monument.\nAlum Bay:\nA classic sequence of upper Paleocene and Eocene (65-44 mya) beds of soft sands and clays, up against the Cretaceous chalk (100-65 mya). The formation would have been the UK's example of the famous K-T boundary that represented and evidenced the end of the dinosaurs and the Mesozoic Era, but the crucial layer containing the iridium from the asteroid impact in Yucatan, Mexico, was eroded away prior to further sedimentation. The sands are coloured by oxidised iron compounds. On the clifftop there is an amusement park and a chair lift takes tourists to and from the beach below. Alternatively, a footpath leads to the beach via Alum Bay Chine (we could take either, time permitting). A traditional souvenir of Alum Bay were ornaments containing layers of the coloured sands. In the past visitors could dig out the sand themselves but the removal of sand is now prohibited.\nFort Albert:\nA tower fort under the cliffs south-west of Yarmouth, built in 1856 as a defence against French invasion and inspired by American defences, but obsolete by 1858. Now Grade II*-listed and privately owned as flats.\nDogs:\nI welcome dogs on my walks and this walk is perhaps suitable for them, although there are sections along the cliff tops which are not fenced and dogs should be kept well away from the edges, and exposure in hot sun may be hazardous. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it):\nA stroll south along Yarmouth's Market Street and St James' Street will lead out of the town to where we'll pick up the bridleway that was the railway line to Freshwater along the River Yar. At Freshwater old church we'll pick up the Freshwater Way through Afton Marshes. We'll then reach the coast at Freshwater Bay and ascend the hill, following the Tennyson Trail west to the cliffs above The Needles. Then, turning east and then north we'll head along the coastal path to Alum Chine (time and stamina may allow a descent to the beach at Alum Bay). We'll then bear east, cross Headon Warren and mostly walk along the seafront, and always on the coastal path, past Totland, Colwell and Norton back to cross the Yar Bridge back into Yarmouth.\n(Photo credits: Alum Bay and the white cliffs of West High Down: Photo ©\nChris Gunns\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Needles, Isle of Wight; Photo ©\nChristine Matthews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Quayside and car ferry, Yarmouth: Photo ©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth Harbour: Photo ©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: Market Square: Photo ©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: The Old House: Photo ©\nChris Downer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: Market Square: Photo ©\nLewis Clarke\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Western Yar at full tide Photo ©\nPaul Coueslant\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Freshwater Bay, Stag Rock and Mermaid Rock: Photo ©\nChris Gunns\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Tennyson Monument, Totland, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nPeter Trimming\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); High Down: Photo ©\nAnne Burgess\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Alum Bay, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nChristine Matthews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); On Headon Warren, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nRobin Drayton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beach at Linstone Chine: Photo ©\nKurseong Carl\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Fort Albert, Cliff's End, Colwell bay, Isle of Wight - 2: Photo ©\nTerry Robinson\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beach at low tide, east of Round Tower Point: Photo ©\nJim Champion\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Looking along the beach towards Yarmouth: Photo ©\nSteve Daniels\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). Photo of The Needles by\nMypix\n, licensed under\nCC BY-SA4.0\n.

The garden was designed as a series of living paintings in the 18th Century and winding paths through the 158 acres will bring us to stunning viewpoints and fascinating garden buildings including a Crystal Grotto, Gothic Tower, Ruined Abbey, Temple of Bacchus, and Turkish Tent.\nPainshill has also been the setting for feature films such as Dorian Gray and 101 Dalmations, TV productions ranging from Bridgerton to Married at First Sight UK, and music videos for Ellie Goulding, Florence & The Machine and Jessie Ware.\nOur walk from Cobham & Stoke d’Abernon train station to Painshill will largely be through countryside and along quiet lanes with far reaching views. We pass Cobham Park and Bramble Wood together with the pretty village of Downside where we shall see the small church (St Michael’s Chapel) overlooking the village green.\nOnce we arrive at Painshill, the historic route around the garden is approximately 3 miles and includes a mix of made and unmade paths.  There are some spectacular views across the Vineyard and from the Gothic Tower plus plenty of birdlife to see around the Serpentine Lake. At the far end of the landscape is the Gothic Tower which you can climb to find views across four counties.\nOur route back from Painshill to the train station will be different (shorter) and will pass through Cobham town centre, urban paths, and suburban areas. If you would like a drink before heading home, the Italian Coffee House is right next to the train station or the Old Plough pub on station road is a 5 min walk away.\nEntrance fee to Painshill\nPainshill prefers visitors to book in advance online and it is also cheaper to do so - the standard price is £12.50 (£15.00 on the door).

Being flat and encircled by the Sussex Border Path the island is highly accessible and open, yet as it's also an RAF base (and has been since 1936), the interior is excitingly inaccessible and secret. Just the coastal strip is public, which is sufficient to give wonderful views of Chichester Harbour to Chidham and Emsworth with the South Downs on the horizon.\nThe public are also permitted, with good reason, to see West Thorney church. St Nicholas is a humble and honest 13th century affair, but more moving still is the cemetery adjoining it where Commonwealth and German airmen lie side-by-side - a poignant gesture of reconciliation. The interest doesn't stop there because Pilsey Island to the south is a secluded sandbank accessible at low tide, and Prinsted village is very pleasant: a Y-shape of lanes with justifiably some of the prettiest cottages on the south coast.\nThe\nroute\nbegins by heading south from Southbourne via lanes and footpaths, which will soon take us to the coast. From there we'll walk past the engagingly scruffy boatyards of Prinsted, across the 'neck' of the island and through the gate to the RAF base and around the island. We'll past Wickor Point and Marker Point. At the far south of the peninsula is Pilsey Island to which low tide will be enable us to cross. From there we'll complete our circuit of the island, heading past Stanbury Point after we've seen what we're permitted to see of West Thorney village and church. We'll walk back through pretty Prinsted and head back to the station at Southbourne.\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring walks get busy so please only book if you know you can make it. If your plans change please free up the space for someone else.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Great for new and regular members!\nJoin OutdoorLads for a journey along the Mersey Valley and Bridgewater Way, as make our way into the heart of LGBT Manchester, Canal Street.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nFletcher Moss Botanical Gardens:\nOpened to the public in 1915, these beautiful gardens were awarded a gold medal by the Royal Horticultural Society in recognition of their outstanding collection. There is a cafe here too, so we can have refreshments as we relax in the gardens.\nChorlton Water Park:\nOriginally a quarry for gravel. This local nature reserve is noe an oasis for many species of water birds, including grebes, swans, herons and kingfishers. There's often an ice cream van on site, if anyone wants an ice cream as we walk around the park's lake.\nSale Water Park:\nOur second water park of the day is also a great place to see many water birds, and is also water sports centre, with people often water skiing, kayaking or swimming there. Jackon's Boat, an old inn, is also here, so we can pop in for a beer, wine or soft drink as we enter the park\nThe Mersey Valley:\nConnecting all of these parks is the Mersey Valley. As we walk along the river we'll see plenty of wildlife and plants. The river is mostly hidden from roads and buildings, so you'll often forget you're in the South Manchester suburbs.\nThe Bridgewater Canal:\nAs we leave the wildlife of the Mersey behind, we'll join the Bridgewater Canal, with it's rich industrial history. This includes lots of Victorian architecture, old mills, newer buildings and Old Trafford stadium (for any football fans)\nCanal Street & The Village:\nAs we finish our walk, we'll come into the iconic Canal Street, where we can have a look in Sackville Gardens before relaxing with a well deserved drink in one of the many bars in the Village.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owners responsibility.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Returning to one of OutdoorLads' favourite bunkhouses in a remote part of Northumberland for THREE nights, this will be a get away from it all weekend. This is a Friday to Monday trip!\nOur venue is located 4 miles from the nearest public road, deep into the Cheviots, along the College Valley. It lies less than 1/2 mile from the Scottish border, sandwiched between the border ridge and the Cheviot (815m).\nIt is surrounded by beautifully rounded Northumberland Hills, close to the northern end of the Pennine Way, with deep, wild valleys, and dramatic gullies created at the end of the last ice age.\nThis will be a remote, away-from-it-all weekend, where phone signals and wi-fi are unlikely, which is a magical chance to connect with OutdoorLads pals and the spectacular scenery that surrounds us. We'll spend two days getting out and exploring on foot - walks are necessarily going to involve some steep climbs and there are no \"gentle\" options - but you'll be rewarded for your efforts with spectacular views!\nThe evenings will be filled with hearty, home-cooked meals, and socialising with fellow OutdoorLads - board games and star gazing are likely to be high on the list of evening entertainment. It will be a fantastic weekend of comradery, great food, and genuinely getting out more!\nThe Hills\nThe\nCheviot Hills\nare a range of rolling hills straddling the Scottish Border with Northumberland. The English section is within the Northumberland National Park. The range includes The Cheviot (the highest hill), plus Hedgehope Hill, Windy Gyle, Cushat Law and Bloodybush Edge.\nThe hills are sometimes considered a part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland as they adjoin the uplands to the north. Since the Pennine Way runs through the region, the hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the Northumberland National Park.\nSome of the gems are in between the hills.\nHen Hole\nis one such place and it makes a wonderful route to the top of the Cheviot from the Hostel. It was created at the end of the last ice age, by meltwater, creating a deep gully with waterfalls, leading up to an amazing basin underneath the Cheviot summit. With some very easy scrambles, it makes a fantastic route to highest point in this whole range of hills.\nWildlife in the College Valley (not that we're guaranteed to see it all!)\nThe valley is well known for its population of\nferal goats\nand is home to around 150. Rumour has it that they were released in medieval times by the monks on Holy Island. This primitive British breed would have died out completely if they hadn't escaped into the wild. As farming changed there was a swing to foreign breeds which produced more milk. The goats can often be seen on the Newton Tors along the eastern side of the Valley. However they can pop up in the most unexpected of places! Over the years many goats have been re-homed to help manage environments elsewhere in the UK and this has helped to ease the pressure on local vegetation.\nRoe deer\nare present throughout the valley. Whilst they are beautiful they also bring their own challenges with damage to trees so their numbers are carefully managed.\nThe valley has a healthy population of\nred squirrels\n. Hazelnuts are a great source of proteins for the squirrels. With care and quiet you could be lucky and see one of these lovely little mammals.\nAdders\n, Britain's only venomous reptile are also present in the valley.\nSlow worms\n, which are really burrowing limbless lizards (commonly mistaken for snakes) are also common. They have been granted protected status along with all other native British reptiles.\nOtters\nare present along the College and Lambden burns.\nThere is a good population of\nrabbits\n,\nhares\n,\nvoles\n,\nfox\n,\nstoat\nand\nweasels\n. These can be seen throughout the valley.\nCollege Valley Estate has spent a lot of time and effort reintroducing\nblack grouse\n, a marvellous bird at risk of imminent extinction in the UK. Black grouse UK, part of the UK Biodiversity plan, is dedicated to reversing this trend towards extinction. In 1995 the Wilderness above Mounthooly was planted with over 55000 broadleaves. This became the largest new native woodland in England. Black grouse were initially quite successful but bad weather has affected recent breeding seasons and numbers have declined.\nThere is a healthy and well managed population of\nred grouse\non all the heather areas in the valley; shooting for these remarkable birds provides a significant income for the estate. The sound of them telling one to 'go-back, go-back, go-back' is one of the sounds of wilderness areas.\nDogs\n. This event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos.\nAll photos taken by Rob Mitchell, OutdoorLads and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

If you'd like a more sedate weekend, we have plenty of less strenuous activities planned and we'll be within easy travelling distance of the towns of Brecon and Abergavenny. Alternatively you can spend the weekend relaxing within the Penpont Estate: exploring the remarkable buildings, gardens, walled kitchen garden the woodland art, maze, tennis courts, croquet lawns, dower house and the 2000 acre estate that surrounds you!\nAfter dusk we will gather together around a campfire, relax and be merry.\n**Please note this event is very popular with free spirited, seasoned OutdoorLads, and as such the fireside conversation can sometimes be explicit, coupled with late night music and dancing. If this type of party atmosphere may not be for you please consider one of the many other great camping events as an alternative.**\nThe overall capacity of this event will be 40; however some places have temporarily been reserved as we need the event leaders to book on, so that we can run all the daytime activities!. The capacity will be reset in the next couple of weeks so please book on the reserve if it seems full.\nCampervans\n: Small campervans are welcome at the site, but limited in number (5) and so subject to availability. They will be parked separately to the tents in the orchard.

    "Summary": "This training course is funded by OutdoorLads for leaders, especially Mountain Walk Leaders, Outdoor/Sport Climbing Leaders, and Mountain Biking Leaders.\nThese leaders are required by our insurance policy to have had Outdoor First Aid training to lead these event types.\nOther outdoor event leaders may book on to this course\n, but those required to complete the training will be prioritised should a waitlist develop.\nThis comprehensive two-day (16 hour) outdoor first aid qualification will give you the skills and knowledge to respond to a range of outdoor emergencies. Based in or near Manchester, you’ll learn when and how to move a casualty, how to deal with major illnesses and injuries, administering CPR and managing someone who is unresponsive.\nThe course is perfect for anyone spending time in the outdoors whether you’re a keen hillwalker or outdoor professional. If you find yourself in an environment where emergency medical assistance could be more than 30 minutes away, these outdoor first aid skills are essential.\nCourses are delivered in a friendly, relaxed manner by experienced outdoor professionals. We keep medical jargon to a minimum with the focus being on practical, active learning. We believe the best way to learn is by ‘doing’ and not by sitting in a classroom with a notebook listening to someone talk at you. Where weather conditions allow, much of the course is taught in the outdoors … exactly where you’d expect to use your new found skills.\nThe qualification meets the Outdoor First Aid Band 3 requirements set by the\nInstitute for Outdoor Learning\nand is ideal for those with outdoor instructor qualifications such as Mountain Leader, Rock Climbing Instructor, Paddlesports Instructor, etc.\nOver the two days, we’ll cover a range of outdoor first aid topics including:\nResuscitation\nCasualty monitoring\nPrimary survey/secondary assessment\nIncident management\nScene survey\nSummoning assistance\nFirst aid equipment\nBones, joints and muscle injuries\nMajor illnesses\nBurns\nWounds and bleeding\nCatastrophic bleeding control\nExtreme heat and cold\nRespiratory disorders\nPoisoning\nHead and spinal injuries\nAnaphylaxis\nEye injuries\nHypovolaemic shock\nBites and stings\nChest and abdominal injuries\nLeaders from anywhere can attend these events, you don't have to live in the same region.\nEvent cost\nTo help us ensure that those that book on to this event are committed to it, we're asking Leaders to pay £15. This payment will be refunded in full once attendance on the course is confirmed after the event. If you cancel before the event and we can fill your place, you will be refunded in full, but otherwise your booking on this event is subject to the\nOutdoorLads refund policy\n.\nPhotos\n: Provided by hellosimon and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement, here\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The vague gap on the map at the centre of Dorset is where the little town of Middleton (Milton) once stood. It had grown up in the middle ages beside the magnificent abbey and was big enough to hold a market. The town was demolished by the 1st Earl of Dorchester between 1771 and 1790 and the abbey, saved for the town at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, was turned into his private chapel adjacent to his fine new house. His tenants were rehoused a mile away in a model village called Milton Abbas, of uniform thatched white cottages which is rather delightful (to us at least).\nThe main town street now lies under the cricket green of Milton Abbey School which is what his house became. All in all, 'the sweep of the church, William Chambers' house and Capability Brown's grounds, set in a glade amid wooded slopes, is one of the great set pieces of English landscape' (Simon Jenkins:\nEngland's Thousand Best Churches\n).\nThe church itself is probably the most impressive in Dorset. It is mainly fourteenth century, enlarged after a fire in 1309 but the Lady Chapel was lost at the dissolution and the nave was never finished. Another fine church also occurs on this walk at Hilton, which has medieval paintings of the twelve apostles and a very picturesque setting in a wooded valley above thatched roofs.\nThe route (see it\nhere\n) will also lead round to the village of Milbourne St Andrew which is a cluster of red brick and cob (clay and straw) cottages on the Dorchester-Blandford Road. The route will then return to the quiet gravel and grassy trackways over fine Dorset downland and woodland with which it began before it completes its circuit back at Milton Abbas.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following: Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Due to the small spaces of the two museums/church, this event is limited to 15 spaces, so please stay on the attendee/waiting list only if you can make it. Thank you.\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event is now fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nA wander from St Paul’s taking in Smithfield meat market and Clerkenwell, visiting The Charterhouse Museum/Chapel, Order of St John Gatehouse Museum and Barbican estate.\nWe should also be able to explore St Bartholomew the Great church and hidden gardens and squares north of St Paul’s Cathedral around Farringdon and Clerkenwell.\nThere will be time for a quick lunch (around 30 minutes), and probably drinks at the end.\nPlease note that all sights/museums have free entry. You may wish to give a donation to the museums and churches we visit as we will not be taking the paid/pre-booked tours.\nThe sights\nWe won’t be guided around each place, but will have time to explore and meet up at the end of each visit to move on, and I will introduce each sight.\nSt Bartholomew the Great church\nhttps://www.greatstbarts.com/visit\nThis is the oldest surviving church in the City from Norman times. It oozes atmosphere, but was also the setting for Charles’s non wedding to “Duckface” in Four Weddings and a Funeral. There is Damien Hirst’s brutal reminder of the grisly end of St Bartholomew (he was skinned alive) and a more picturesque half timbered gatehouse. Ironically, it stands next to St Bart’s Hospital and the well known execution site at Smithfield and its meat market (1327 to likely closure in 2028).\nOrder of St John and Gatehouse Museum\nhttps://museumstjohn.org.uk\nNow best known for St John’s Ambulance, the military Order of St John was founded in Jerusalem and established the priory in Clerkenwell. We will visit the museum at St John’s Gatehouse (free entry). Please note we will not visit the church, crypt and historic rooms which are only seen on a pre-booked paid tour.\nThe Charterhouse Museum and Chapel\nhttps://thecharterhouse.org/explore-the-charterhouse/\nThe Charterhouse (almshouse) is still home to the religious Brothers, having been established as a monastery in 1348 as well as founding Charterhouse school (now in Surrey). We will visit the museum and Chapel (free entry), which were opened to the public in 2017 for the first time. Please note that we will not take the organised tour of the grounds/other buildings.\nBarbican Estate\nThe Barbican is now Grade 2 listed and the 2000 flat estate arose from the ruins of bombed London, with the arts centre opening in 1982. I will take you on an exploration of the Brutalist architecture and the terraces.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs\nSorry, no dogs are permitted at these sights.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "10",
    "Summary": "IMPORTANT - The K2B is now full so we cannot accept any more signups at least for now.\nGot a New Year's resolution to take on a new challenge?  Fancying something to train for to get fit?  Or just a bit mad and like walking a long way in some beautiful Lakeland scenery?\nWell, this event could be for you - the Keswick to Barrow Challenge is back for 2025!\nWhat is it?\nWell, it's a very long walk - approximately 40 miles from just outside Keswick to Barrow-in-Furness with about 2000m of climb (spread out over a long way - it's not a mountain walk, don't worry!)\nBut it's more than that...\nIt's a charity fundraiser - we'll be collecting sponsorship to split between OutdoorLads and other charities nominated by the K2B Foundation who organise the event as well as the costs of running the event.\nIt's a massive achievement  - when you cross the finish line you'll feel amazing (and maybe think about doing it again next year?)\nIt's a huge event - with teams from all over the country, both smaller ones like ours and from big companies, fundraising for all manner of different charities.\nCan I actually do that?\nIt might be a long way - but as a bit of a veteran of quite a few endurance events your leader has every confidence!  You will want to do some training, though, few people can manage this sort of thing without.  Unsurprisingly the best form of training for walking is more walking...so why not sign up for some ODL walks and build up your distance!  There's no need to do super-long distances in training, though, just plenty of walking and be sure to try out any kit you're planning on using on the day.\nThe team\nThere's a minimum team size of 4 for the event (but we can enter more and we hope we will!) - however that's more for administrative reasons and we don't have to walk together throughout the event, so whether you're an accomplished ultramarathon runner and reckon you'll get round in 5 hours, or whether you're a walker who'd rather enjoy the scenery and take all day, it's all good.  If people do want to walk together that's also great, though, and we can provide each other some support along the way - there'll be plenty of time to talk about things like that on the run-up to the event.  Either way, you'll never be on your own with the hundreds of others taking part!\nAccommodation\nIf you live locally and can get dropped off at the start at the crack of dawn you don't necessarily need accommodation.  However for the rest of us we typically look at accommodation for the weekend in Barrow so there isn't far to go at the end of the walk (you'll probably not be in a fit state to drive anywhere!).  In previous years the Premier Inn (where your leader is staying) and Travelodge have offered good options but there's lots available so you can pick somewhere that suits your budget etc.  Don't book Saturday breakfast - you'll be up and out far too early for that :)\nWe usually meet up for a meal and a drink or two on the Friday early evening before a reasonably early night before the walk (and some walk related admin e.g. giving numbers out) - likely this will be near the Premier Inn but we can work that out depending on where people are staying.\nGetting to the start\nThe organisers provide what they call a \"Happy Bus\" coach service from many of the Barrow hotels to get you to the start - this leaves in the early hours of Saturday morning (3-4am!) which might be where the name came from (er!) - this is bookable at a small charge later on.  You can also have someone drop you off at the start if you have someone to do that but there is no parking available there so we do recommend the bus.  There isn't a bus the other way which is why we tend to stay in Barrow (also it tends to be a lot cheaper than Keswick for hotels etc).\nFundraising\nEach walker needs to raise £80 to take part in the event as a minimum, which is to be donated via the K2B website and not other sites e.g. JustGiving.  You'll get a personalised link to raise sponsorship which you can send out to as many people as possible to help reach your target!\nSounds great - how do I sign up?\nThere are a few things you'll need to do to get signed up:\nRegister an account on the K2B website at the below link and message the leader your Member ID so I can add you to the team when it has been set up.  If you already have a registration from previous years you can use the same one, you don't need to create a new one.\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/user/register\nSign up to this event page.\nOnce I've confirmed we have a minimum team of 4 signed up, book accommodation (this is at your own cost).  As prices can and do go up as the event approaches, it might be worth doing this sooner if there are suitable refundable options.  The leader is staying in the Premier Inn in Barrow but there are plenty of other options if that's not to your taste.  Don't book Saturday breakfast as you'll be leaving way too early for that!\nWhen looking for accommodation note the bus pickups are really early (around 3-4am).  The event buses do serve places other than Barrow itself but you'd need to get yourself from Barrow back to those places after the walk.\nNote that if we only have 4 and someone drops out that doesn't stop us walking - we just need a minimum of 4 signed up to confirm the team.\n(Provisional bus information:\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/happy-buses\n)\nYou will then need to pay your entry fee which is £15, and book your bus seat at £10.\nOnce we have the team all set up you'll be able to start collecting sponsorship via your own page on the K2B website - good luck!\nRemember there is a minimum commitment to raise £80 to be allowed to walk\n- this is the K2B's rule, not ours - so start in plenty of time :)\nDogs\nDogs are allowed on the K2B event itself BUT are not allowed on the event buses nor in most hotels, so if you intend to bring one (make sure it can walk 40 miles!) you will need to check arrangements carefully and arrange your own transport to the start (noting again that it's drop-off only, no parking is allowed anywhere near the start).  Dogs are allowed on the field at the finish but must be on a lead.\nObviously assistance dogs are allowed should you require one for a disability but please let the leader know if you are bringing an assistance dog so I can let the organisers know.\nPhoto credits\nThe photos on this event page were taken by previous participants/leaders including Danny McKeown-Henshall and are used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Some potential routes include completing the circuit of\nGlyder Fach & Glyder Fawr\n, hiking over\nY Garn & Carnedd y Filiast\n, which are right behind our hostel, or even the more adventurous\nSeniors Ridge\n, which is a great introductory grade 1 scramble. The actual options will be confirmed closer to the event.\nChris, on the other hand, will be manning the hostel, ensuring that when you return from your treks the kettle is on and the cakes are at the ready!\nAs we will be hiking in a mountain environment, please review the \"What to Bring\" section closely to ensure you are properly kitted out, keeping in mind potential weather issues!

    "Summary": "Come and join us\nfor 3 nights (Good Friday to Easter Monday)\nsplashing about in the ancient harbour town of Brixham this Easter.\nBrixham has been around probably since Saxon times (6th-8th Century) and has had a colourful history - including Pirates and it was even where King William III landed when he invaded to conquer England in 1688.\nOur home for the weekend is right on the quay with views across the harbour towards Torquay on the far side of the Bay.  Nestled cosily on the water’s edge, the historic fishing port is only a 5 minute walk away along the promenade in one direction, with the beach a similar distance in the other way.\nWe'll be taking advantage of the location as well with additional options for Kayaking/Canoe, Caving, Abseiling and Coasteering during the weekend.\nThe Accommodation\nWe'll be staying in an Outdoor Education Centre on the seafront in Brixham.  The dorms on the upper floors all have spectacular sea views and there is a nice lounge as well as a separate dining room for us to spread out in.\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect this Easter\nGood Friday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday, and find the bed you've reserved (more details on this closer to the time). Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge or dining room with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. Bring along something to feed one or two people, and home-cooked is always preferred.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge or dining room.\nEaster Saturday\nOn Easter Saturday, we'll be looking at a range of activities you can sign up for.\nFree Activity:\nThere will be a hike arranged in the local area for those who want to explore.\nPaid Activities:\nKayaking/Canoeing/SUP\nCaving\nEaster Sunday\nEaster Sunday we'll have options of:\nFree Activity:\nA gentle walk from the Centre along the coastal path to Berry Head, where we might bump into the Abseilers (see below)  and then onwards to Man Sands. where, if the weather is good, you can spend the rest of the afternoon relaxing.\nPaid Activities\nCoasteering\nAlternatively, Paignton is the home of\nSplashdown Quaywest\n- one of the largest waterparks in the UK and home of 'The Devils Drop', 'The Screamer' and 'Wild Kamikaze' water slides.  So, if you want you can head there for the afternoon.  It's about a 15 min drive to Splashdown Quaywest from Brixham.\nEaster Monday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington. Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn.\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nImage Credits:\nImage 1:\nPublic Domain\n; Image 2-4: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 5: Bridlington Sea Front\n© Nicholas Hutton and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n.",

We skirt the top of the\nForest of Bowland\n, perhaps making a quick side trip to see the\nGreat Stone of Fourstones\n, before stopping for a pub lunch in Clapham or\nSettle\n.\nAny coast-to-coast route is going to involve some hills.  The good news is that the Way of the Roses is much kinder than many routes.  However, the climb out of Settle is crazy steep . . . and cobbled.  But it’s also pretty short; the main action is over in half a mile, after which you can take in the views of the Yorkshire Dales.\nWe head further east through the Dales before finishing up in Grassington, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n84km (52 miles) with 1,200 (3,609ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as a lot of the distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n.\n**\nYou will need to carry all your kit and book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in and around Grassington.  Skip plans to stay at the Old Hall Inn in Threshfield (1.5km outside Grassington).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should any arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nImage Credits:\nImage 1, 4, 5 and 6: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 2: First Way of the Roses Waymarker ©\nAntiquary\nand licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; Image 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL.",

    "Summary": "Introduction:\nLast year it was an Isle of Wight Double. This year it's an all-new Dorset (plus a bit of Devon) Double, taking place on the Saturday and Sunday of the late-May Bank Holiday weekend. Campsites and B&Bs might be a little hard to find later on and expensive as the late May Bank Holiday weekend is at the start of the half-term holiday, so you are advised to book right now. Demand for the Double Event may be reduced as Big Spring Camp will be running at the same time, but even so, I hope you can come and experience a double-bill of outstanding coastal walks on the Jurassic Coast, centred on Lyme Regis, the 'Pearl of Dorset', a place equipped with an array of B&Bs and campsites.\nSchedule:\nDay 1 (Saturday 24 May): Seaton and Beer to Lyme Regis and Charmouth\n- linear walk with bus from Lyme Regis/Charmouth to the starting point at Seaton.\nDay 2 (Sunday 25 May): Lyme Regis and Charmouth to Whitchurch Canonicorum, Ryall and Golden Cap - circular walk.\nPublic transport to Lyme Regis and Charmouth:\nRail:\nThe nearest railway station is Axminster, which is served by hourly direct services from London Waterloo on a journey lasting 2 hours, 42 minutes.\nLocal buses:\nBuses from Axminster Railway Station to Lyme Regis and Charmouth depart at 15 minutes past the hour (except at 16.25 and 17.20). The last service is 18.15, but they could run later in peak season. They take 25-30 minutes to get to Lyme Regis and Charmouth respectively and go near the campsites. I will confirm these details closer to the event.\nAccommodation:\nBook for at least\nFriday 23 May to Sunday 25 May\n(3 nights). The following day is Bank Holiday Monday.\nYou are advised to book now\nif you can.\n(By way of a disclaimer, I don't know what any of these sites are like; they're just in the vicinity.)\nCampsites:\nChoose one near Charmouth, such as\nCummins Farm\n. There is also\nManor Farm\nwhich does caravans and chalets too. If you want to stay in Uplyme (which is outside of Lyme Regis, and is a little far out of town), try\nHook Farm\n. I reckon Cummins Farm is best for traditional, basic camping.\nCaravans, glampers and pods sites:\nNewlands Farm\nand\nWood Farm\n. These sites are both in Charmouth, have extensive facilities, but are family-oriented.\nB&Bs:\nChoose one in, or within a mile of, Lyme Regis or Charmouth. Search Booking.com\nhere\n.\nDay 2 - Lyme Regis to Golden Cap:\nThis is a circular walk that spends a little more time inland before returning to the majesty of the coastline. Those staying in Lyme Regis will get extra distance to cover, but with the benefit of a walk along the shore where abundant fossils may be found. There will be three main ascents: the first is Hardown Hill, which is an Iron Age hillfort; the second is Golden Cap, which is the highest point on the south coast at 191 metres; the third is merely a hill outside Charmouth. All three points will offer magnificent views over land and over sea. In addition, there will be some lovely little villages such as Whitchurch Canonicorum, whose church contains the only intact saints’ reliquary in England.\nDay 2 - the sights:\nCharmouth:\nA picturesque coastal village known for its stunning Jurassic Coast scenery and rich fossil-hunting opportunities. Its origins go back to Roman times. During the Saxon period, it was known as 'Cernmunde' and the village witnessed fierce Viking battles in the C9. It grew into a small medieval market town, benefiting from its location on ancient trade routes. Its cliffs, part of the UNESCO Jurassic Coast, are famous for fossils, attracting naturalists since the C19. It is now suburbanised but retains its charm.\nWhitchurch Canonicorum:\nA picturesque village in Marshwood Vale, renowned for its historic church, St. Candida and Holy Cross, which contains the only church shrine in Britain to have survived the Reformation with its relics intact, those of St Candida (St Wite), a Christian martyred by the Danes, or alternatively a West Saxon anchoress (a female religious recluse). (Westminster Abbey also contains a saint's relics, those of Edward the Confessor.)\nRyall:\nA pleasant hamlet nestled in Marshwood Vale. Surrounded by rolling hills and lush countryside, it offers superb views. Known for its close-knit community and rural charm.\nHardown Hill and Hillfort:\nIts prominence of over 150m qualifies it as one of Dorset's four Marilyns and it is listed as one of the 'top 12 Dorset views to take your breath away' by Dorset's official tourist website, with expansive views over the Marshwood Vale. The hillfort (Iron Age, spanning approximately 800 BCE to 43 CE) features earthen ramparts and ditches, though much is eroded.\nGolden Cap:\nThe highest point on the southern coast of England, rising 191 meters (627 feet). Composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily sandstone, limestone and shale, it forms part of the cliffs that showcase the region's rich geological history. Part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its geological importance. The site provides stunning panoramic views, and its distinctive golden-hued cliffs are a popular destination for hikers, geologists, and nature enthusiasts alike.\nFossil hunting:\nThe area is renowned for its abundance of fossils (exposed as we'll be passing at low tide) due to its unique geology and ongoing coastal erosion. Key reasons include:\nJurassic Period Rocks: The cliffs around Charmouth are composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily shale and limestone, formed around 200 million years ago during the Jurassic period. These rocks preserve a wide range of marine life from this era.\nContinual Erosion: Natural erosion caused by waves, wind, and rain constantly exposes new fossil layers, making fossils accessible on the beach.\nVariety of Fossils: The area was a marine environment during the Jurassic, so it contains numerous fossils of ammonites, belemnites, ichthyosaurs, and other ancient marine creatures.\nSoft Mudstones: The clay-rich Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone formations are relatively soft, allowing fossils to be easily revealed and extracted without extensive excavation.\nDay 2 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThose staying in Lyme Regis will start at The Square and walk along the coast to Charmouth (the tide will be low). We'll ascend Lower Sea Lane and pick up the guys staying in Charmouth. We'll then head east along The Street and Berne Lane and cross the A35, continuing on Berne Lane as far as Whitchurch Canonicorum, where we'll follow Lower Street, then Higher Street to Ryall. We'll then make our first ascent: up Hardown Hillfort. We'll then take footpaths to the A35 and over Muddyford Lane to ascend Golden Cap. The South West Coast Path (SWCP) will return us to Charmouth, and those staying in Lyme Regis can continue back on foot (along the shore or using the SWCP) or by bus.\nBe assured that I will be reconnoitering this route to check that it works!\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but some of it is under trees so will be cooler. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Search Booking.com\nhere\n.\nDay 1 - Seaton and Beer to Lyme Regis and Charmouth:\nThe first of our daywalks is linear and contrasts a genteel seaside town with a quaint fishing village, and combines tangled woodlands with rugged cliffs. The bus will pick up some of our party in Charmouth, then the rest of us in Lyme Regis before its goes to Seaton over the border in Devon to deposit us for the walk to begin. We'll head to Beer, have coffee (or beer) there, then head to Seaton for a stroll on the prom. Crossing the River Axe we'll follow the crumpled and crumbling coastline from the safe distance of the South West Coast Path, glimpsing the sea through the trees. We'll finish in Lyme Regis overlooking The Cobb and those staying in Charmouth can continue on foot or take the bus.\nDay 1 - the sights:\nBeer:\nA delightful fishing village in East Devon. Its name is not derived from the drink but from the Old English word\nbearu\n, meaning 'grove', referring to the surrounding forest. It is situated in a smugglers' cove, and caves were once used to store contraband goods. Beer Stone has long been prized because of its workability for carving and for its gentle yellow colour. Quarrying, fishing and lace production were the sources of income until tourism and model railways developed (Peco, founded 1946, has its head office and factory in the village.)\nSeaton:\nA seaside town and fishing harbour with an attractive promenade. The town was small and centred around fishing and farming until the arrival of the railway (now a preserved tramway) in 1868 when it became a resort. Many of the buildings are Victorian, but it also has notable buildings from the 1930s.\nBeer to Seaton Cliffs:\nTo the east of Seaton are the red-coloured cliffs of Triassic age rocks, capped by younger rocks (Cretaceous) of the greensand. The Seaton Fault, which is visible at Seaton Hole at the western end of the beach, allows the chalk into the sequence which runs to Beer Head.\nAxmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff: '\nA sheltered wooded wilderness...situated on one of the most active coastal landslide systems in Western Europe with a band of folds and troughs constantly evolving and being shaped and reshaped by landslips [where greensand rocks slump on soft] clay. The Undercliff has a reputation for being the closest thing you’ll get to a rainforest in the UK with a warm and humid microclimate nurturing a carpet of ferns, fungi, wild clematis and orchids beneath a dense leafy canopy...It’s also home to a variety of birds and wildlife including ravens, peregrine falcons and owls as well as reptiles and amphibians such as grass snake, common lizard and great crested newt...One of the many highlights of the route is Goat Island, famous for being the first ever scientifically described and recorded landslip...The landslip became very famous and was visited by Queen Victoria.' (From the 'Love Lyme Regis'\nwebsite\n.)\nJurassic Coast:\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, crucial for its rich geological history spanning 185 million years. Its cliffs reveal layers from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, offering insights into Earth's past. Renowned for fossils, it attracts scientists, educators, and tourists, blending natural beauty with historical significance.\nLyme Regis:\n'The Pearl of Dorset' is a gorgeous seaside town. Visitors can explore its quaint streets lined with independent shops, galleries, and restaurants and holidaymakers can enjoy its sandy beach. Dating back to Saxon times, its name derived from the River Lim. Granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1284, it became 'Regis' (of the King) and thrived as a port. The Cobb, a huge sea wall, first constructed in the C13, supported the town’s maritime trade. Lyme Regis played a role in significant events, including the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685. The town gained fame for its connections to paleontology, particularly through Mary Anning’s discoveries of fossil plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs in the C19. Lyme Regis has inspired film and literature, most notably in Jane Austen’s\nPersuasion\n, where the Cobb sets pivotal scenes. John Fowles’\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\nportrays the town, with the Cobb central to the novel and its 1981 film adaptation with Meryl Streep.\nDay 1 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThe bus will drop us at the western end of Seaton Esplanade where we'll take the inland branch of the South West Coast Path (SWCP) and follow Beer Road, Old Beer Road and New Road to Beer. After time to explore Beer, we'll meet up by the bay, and pick up the coastal branch of the SWCP back to Seaton and walk along Seaton seafront. We'll then cross the River Axe and using Squire's Lane, ascend the hills and clifftops that will take us all the way back to Lyme Regis. We'll emerge at the point that the Cobb attaches to the land. Members can explore Lyme Regis or take the bus back to Charmouth if they need.\nBe assured that I will be reconnoitering this route and the transport logistics to check that they work!\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but much of it is under trees so will be cooler. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\n(Images: The Cobb, Lyme Regis: Photo ©\nMalc McDonald\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Beach at Beer, Devon: Photo ©\nmichael cooper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beer: A Pretty Village in East Devon: Photo ©\nMr Eugene Birchall\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n);\nAllotments by Common Lane, Beer\n: Photo ©\nRobin Stott\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beach huts on the promenade at Seaton: Photo ©\nDavid Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View along West Walk, Seaton Promenade: Photo ©\nJohn Stephen\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Axmouth Harbour: Photo ©\nBob Jones\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bindon Cliffs: Photo ©\nTony Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A glimpse of Charton Bay from the Undercliff: Photo ©\nJohn Allan\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pinhay Bay Cliffs: Photo ©\nNigel Mykura\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Lyme Bay: Photo ©\nMarika Reinholds\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Lyme Regis Harbour: Photo ©\nPaul Allison\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

Check out all the events over the weekend of 4-6 April 2025:\nOutdoorLads.events/APR25\n. Great for new and regular members!\nThe\nShropshire Moss & Meres 100\nis a 106km cycling audax event, starting from Upton Magna near Shrewsbury.  The route heads north west along pleasant rural roads through Baschurch to Welsh Frankton before turning for Ellesmere and the lovely café stop at Whixall Marina.  The return leg ambles across the North Shropshire Plain, through the villages of Tilstock, Tibberton and High Ercall.\nThe Meres and Mosses are a series of wetlands in the north-west Midlands of England and north-east Wales that are home to some of the UK's rarest wildlife.\nMeres\nare glacial lakes that are the deepest of the water-filled basins left behind by retreating ice sheets.\nMosses\nare peat bogs that formed in shallower basins when peat accumulated over millennia.\nAn audax or sportive (also known internationally as a randonnée) is a long-distance, non-competitive cycling event that has to be completed within a set time limit\n, including any stops to eat or rest.  It's like parkrun, but for cycling.  It's not a race, and individual riders' times are generally not published; if you finish within the time limit, you've succeeded!\nThis audax is 106km and the time limit to complete is 7h04mins.  The average cyclist doing approx 20kph /12mph would take about 5 hours to complete the course.\nThe route is\nquite challenging, given the distance: 106km (66 miles) with 540m (1,772ft) of ascent -\nmostly rolling countryside, with no significant hill climbs. The route is best suited to road bikes (or gravel bikes with relatively narrow tyres) and those with sufficient road cycling experience, as the route is on-road.\nThe course can be viewed\non Cycle.travel here\nand the GPX can be downloaded from the\nAudax UK website\n.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nNote that the\nShropshire Moss & Meres 100\nis run by a third party (via Audax UK) and not by Outdoorlads itself.\nTo participate you must enter via the\nAudax UK website\n(in addition to signing up to this ODL event).\nThe cost to enter is £8.00 for Cycling UK or Audax UK members (add £3 insurance for non-members) - Note that entries will close on 25 March 2025.\nCycling Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event. You only need to complete a Cycling Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage credits:\nImages are from pxhere / pixabay and are public domain / free use photos.",

    "Summary": "Spend a week with OutdoorLads exploring the incredible Greek island of Kos!\nIf you are interested in coming to Kos and the event is full please book onto the waiting list!\nITINERARY & COSTS - All attendees must make their own flight & travel arrangements to Kos.  Attendees will also need to cover the cost of the accommodation and any food / drinks.\nAs of 05 January, Jet2 has announced an airfare sale from all UK airports; EasyJet has a 20% sale on and SkyExpress flies from Gatwick, with a short layover in Athens.\nLocated in the southeastern Aegean Sea, Kos is the third largest island of the Dodecanese chain.  The three main towns are Kos Town, Kefalos and Kardamena (which will be our base) and are filled with wonderful restaurants, bars and shops.  Additionally there are numerous beaches around the island, ancient ruins (the island is home to Hippocrates), beautiful Orthodox churches, amazing wines and of course baklava and\ngalaktoboureko\n!\nThe many beaches include sandy stretches with sun loungers and bars, rocky, secluded, thermal and even a naturist one!  At the beautiful Agios Stefanos (one of the pictures below) you can swim out to the tiny islet of Kastri to visit the still-standing 4th century paleo-Christian church.  Therma Beach consists of a natural hot springs feeding into the Aegean, and water temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees!  Polemi Beach is the naturist (or \"textile optional\") beach located in a secluded cove along the central southern coast.\nOur accommodation for the week will be\nMina Studios\n, located in the heart of Kardamena.  All rooms are fully en-suite, with a small kitchen (with kettle, fridge, 2 burner electric stove) and balcony or patio.  Beds can be almost any arrangement - up to 3 twins, 2 twins, or 1 double and 1 twin.  Rooms are €55 per room per night (not per person) and can be paid to Mina directly prior to arrival (bank details to be provided later in private messages).  Mina's is located less than a 10 minute walk from the main beach and town square, where great bars and restaurants are numerous!  There are also two good sized grocery stores within 10 minutes.\nIt is strongly recommended that everyone secure their own travel insurance, to include any sports activities you may wish to enjoy.\n01 May - Arrival Day for most:\nKos Airport (code\nKGS\n) is served nonstop by the following airlines:\nEasyJet\n(Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, London Gatwick),\nBritish Airways\n(London Gatwick),\nJet2\n(Birmingham, Bristol, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, London Stansted, Manchester, Newcastle), and\nTui\n(Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, East Midlands, London Gatwick, London Luton,  Manchester, Newcastle).\nI will already be at Mina's so will arrange airport pick-up's based on everyone's arrival times.\n02 May - Arrival day for some:\nAs some are arriving today, those of us already in Kos will do a short morning walk.\nAirport pick-ups will be arranged according to the flight arrival times.\nOf course if you prefer to enjoy the beach that is perfectly fine too!\n03 May:\nWe have several options today!  Should you wish to stay in town you can:\nExplore the island on your own.  Options in Kardamena include hiring a scooter (from €45 per day), quad bike (from €85 per day), stand-up paddleboard ( €20 for 60 minutes) or a jet ski (€60 for 15 minutes).  Consider parasailing (€60 for 10 minutes), or grab your passport, go to Kos Town and sail 20 minutes across the strait to Bodrum, Turkey (roughly €20-€40 return).  Or just spend the entire day on the beach drinking Greek coffee and enjoying the sun!\nAll participants must not engage in any activity which is likely to compromise their safety or the safety of any other person.\nOutdoorLads accepts no liability for any activities booked independently.\nFor those that want to get out and explore, we can enjoy this little \"\nleg-stretcher\n\" hike of just under 9km, starting right in Kardamena.  A flat start along the beach leads to a 20% uphill grade at about 4.5km to beautiful views back toward town.  From the turning point there is a short, steep (18%) downhill grade crossing scrubland back into town.  We will return in plenty of time for the afternoon at the beach, before enjoying a wonderul dinner back at Mina's.\nYou will need water and snacks which we can get at one of the shops along the beach.\n04 May:\nAfter yesterday's free day, we tackle a\n16.5km\nhike from the beach up to Plaka Forest, along the airport ring road and back down to the beach.\nThe forest of Plaka is full of tall pines, cooling streams and dozens of freely roaming peacocks!  Oh and a few stray cats to keep everyone in line!\nAs with yesterday, food, water and snacks will need to be brought along.\n05 May:\nAs this is meant to be a relaxing week, today is another free day!  There are plenty of options for short hikes around the area if we are so inclined, but there are also pools, waterparks and more beaches!\n06 May:\nThis morning we will board the 09.30 \"Captain Dimitris\" from Kardamena harbour for the 20 minute crossing to Nisyros (roughly €20 return) and the harbour town of Mandraki.  From the dock we will hike up to the\nEvaggelistria Monastery\nand back (the linked map only shows the return route, but it will be \"up and back\").\nWe will need to be back at the dock no later than 16.00 to catch the last ferry back.  This shouldn't be too much of a problem, as the hike is about 8km round trip.\n07 May:\nSomeone has a birthday today so we will come up with a special way to celebrate!!!  More details will be posted here as we get closer to the day.\n08 May - Departure Day (for some)\nSadly for some of us the Greek adventure comes to an end today.  Transfers to the airport will be arranged accordingly.\nHowever as most departing flights are late evening we will come up with an activity for everyone.\n09 May - Departure Day (for others)\nAs with yesterday, transfers to the airport will be arranged according to your flight departure time (allowing plenty of time for Customs clearance and last minute shopping.\nShould you wish to stay longer on this island paradise I can provide Mina's contact details privately.  The \"official\" ODL event will end on Thursday 08 May.\nIMPORTANT!
