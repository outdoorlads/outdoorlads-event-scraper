    "Summary": "We have secured an amazing opportunity to be part of the restoration of the Montgomery canal!\nThe Montgomery canal (the \"Monty\") runs from Lower Frankton in Shropshire to Newtown in Powys and is one of the most beautiful rural canals in the UK. Restoration efforts are now focusing on reshaping and lining the canal bed at the south of the Shropshire part of the canal. Activities typically include scrub clearing, liner laying, block laying etc. More details of restoration activities can be found here, including reports from previous work parties which give a sense of what we will be doing across the weekend:\nhttps://shropshireunion.org.uk/restoration/\nPractically, this event will require some physical work but will be based on what you feel able to do and will be under the supervision of experienced volunteers. There will be a health and safety briefing on the morning you join the event.\nThe volunteering will start between 8am and 9am on Friday 10th April 2026, but you have the option to join 8am to 9am on Saturday 11th April 2026 if you can't make the Friday.\nPlease message me when you sign up to indicate whether you will start on Friday or Saturday. If starting Saturday, please let me know if you will arrive Friday night or Saturday morning.\nThere are local options for B&B and campsites. For those who want to camp, subject to having enough numbers,\nhttps://www.wildcontentment.com/\nhave agreed to open a weekend early for us and accommodate us! They have some amazing bathrooms as part of their campsite - please take a look.\nPlease let me know if you would like to camp as part of a group when you sign up (which will be subject to separate payment).\nI will look to co-ordinate a\ndinner on the Saturday\nevening once we have more clarity on numbers.\nPlease let me know if you would like to be included in a Saturday evening pub dinner when you sign up.\nThe Monty has been part of my life for about 20 years now and it truly is a beautiful part of the borderlands. I hope you can come and join in the mission to help close the last few hundred metres of dry canal so we can get the canal fully restored for future generations to enjoy.",

    "Summary": "This walk starts in the pretty market town of Bakewell in the heart of the Peak District and takes in some of the highlights of the National Park.\nWe head off from Bakewell to the picturesque village of Ashford on the Water before heading up towards Monsal Head, overlooking the Monsal Head viaduct and trail,  taking in the glorious views down Upper Dale and Monsal Dale.\nThe Headstone Viaduct was built by the Midland Railway in 1863 over the River Wye and is 300 feet long. It had five 50-foot span arches;some 70 feet high at the centre. Whilst it is renowned for its beauty, when it was first built it was heavily criticised by some for destroying the beauty of the landscape.\nThe Monsal Trail was opened in 1981 after the rail link between Manchester and Matlock was closed in 1968 and is popular with day trippers.\nWe’ll head back via the Headstone Tunnel and veer off the trail back towards Ashford before heading back into Bakewell and a chance to eat the famous Bakewell Pudding.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked, please\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date. If you will not attend,\ncancel your attendance\nas soon as possible to allow someone else to take your place.\nAll images provided by the event leader with permission for ODL use.",

    "Summary": "Come and walk the old railways of Granton, Newhaven & Leith and burn off those Christmas excesses!\nLong before the phrase Active Travel entered government lexicon Lothian Regional Council started buying old railway trackbeds from British Rail, as BR went about removing the railway network in the 70s and 80s that had existed across the north of Edinburgh. This foresightedness has left a legacy of a network of popular paths crossing the city.\nThis figure of eight walk covers a large proportion of these lines, starting from Scotland Street station which was the original terminus of the Edinburgh, Leith & Newhaven railway when it opened in August 1842. From here we head north to Trinity and west to Granton. Here the EL&G (having decided that it wanted to go to Granton, not just Newhaven) met the Caledonian and we take up the Caleys route south to Crew junction before heading east to Leith. From Leith we pick up the EL&G again which takes us back to Scotland Street.\nApart from one detour near Chancelot, the route is entirely on tarmac paths as the council have improved these railway paths for cyclists. Whilst most of the routes are as they were when rails ran along them much has changed around them, so is an interesting perspective on the changing face of Edinburgh and Leith.\nPhotos :\nTaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We might want to dwell a while, unless there's a gale blowing!\nSo, wrap up warm, bring your waterproofs and windproofs, some foods, drink and festive cheers and enjoy OutdoorLads' company on Boxing Day.\nDogs are welcome on this walk, under close control because of wildlife and livestock in fields.\nPhotos :\nTaken by Rob Mitchell\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

Here your technique and your problem solving ability counts just as much as your strength, so be prepared to work out both body and mind, all in a very social and friendly atmosphere (seriously, the puzzle solving nature of this sport acts as an amazing ice breaker when chatting to new people). I will also be there to welcome you into the group and answer any questions you may have, as well as offer climbing tips should you need them 😊.\nWe will be meeting at the\nGallery Bouldering\ncenter located in the heart of Oxford, offering over 100m of bouldering wall (and growing) with a diverse range of routes catering for beginners all the way to Font 7C, so that there is something for all skill levels to enjoy. Afterwards we may also pop in for a pint at one of the many nearby pubs.\nAs with most climbing gyms there is a\nwaiver\nthat you will need to sign to check that you understand the risks involved and the proper climbing etiquette to follow to keep others and yourself safe while climbing. This can be filled out at reception but can also be done ahead of time by following the link\nhere\n.\nPlease also note that this is a\nliquid chalk only\ngym, which can be readily purchased at reception.\nHope to see you there!\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Just use the code XMASSE50 at the checkout to save!\n👛\nThe North Norfolk coast is famous for its long, sandy beaches and whilst we won't be able to enjoy long hot sunny days on the beach (although who knows with the weather this year!) we can still enjoy all that this stunning part of the UK has to offer, so come join us for the Southeast Christmas 2025.\nSheringham is located on the North Norfolk coast and our accommodation is in town.  This provides great opportunities for shopping (think about those last minute Christmas presents) as well as a chance to enjoy the local coffee shops and pubs or just the ability to walk on the long sandy beach!\nThe Accommodation\nWe have used this hostel a number of times and you can expect dormitory style accommodation with some spare beds available allowing us to spread-out throughout the building, there is a decent size lounge and with a bit of OutdoorLads festive magic, we'll soon have the common area's looking like Santa's Grotto!\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect if this is your first OutdoorLads Christmas event.\nFriday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday. Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge, with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. Bring along something to feed one or two people, and home-cooked is always preferred.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge, or perhaps enjoy some board games (don't forget to bring your favourites).\nSaturday\nAfter breakfast on Saturday morning you'll head out on your choice of activity (we'll list these out below as they are confirmed), returning to our accommodation early afternoon. This means you will likely need a packed lunch that you will need to bring yourself.\nFor those of you that like your Parkrun on a Saturday morning, Sheringham has you covered and we'll time our daytime activities to give you a chance to do both.\nOutdoorLads hostel events always rely on everyone mucking in and helping in the kitchen over the weekend and Christmas is no different, so whilst a few volunteers are busy in the kitchen, we'll hopefully have some Christmas themed activities in the lounge including our traditional Secret Santa.\nIt wouldn't be a Christmas hostel without Christmas dinner. You can expect a starter, traditional Christmas roast, vegan option and all the trimmings followed by dessert.\nWe'll need some volunteers to clear up in the kitchen and dining room, but once that's done it will be a chance to relax and digest, there could be some music on but I'm sure the board games will be in full swing again.\nSunday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much tea/coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nOur plan is to offer a short walk or cultural event on the Sunday for those that are not in a hurry to leave, but this is subject to volunteers stepping up to lead this for you!\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nCar Sharing\nChristmas is the time for sharing, so if driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our Southeast events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/joinchat/N2IyUFkBzJRyiZQpqlm6ZQ\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense? Apply for a place on this event through the OutdoorLads Foundation! Nobody apart from staff members will know and we don't need lots of financial info from you either. To apply through the Foundation, you'll need to complete a very short form, which can be found along with more information\nhere\n.\nWant to Pay By Instalments?\nYou can arrange to pay in instalments if that helps. Please contact the office on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nwho will help you to secure a place and set up paying in instalments.

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at Nottingham’s newest bouldering venue\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nPhotos:\nAll images supplied by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

You will need a relatively good level of fitness for the walk.\nPlease bring a packed lunch\nand maybe a flask of hot drink if it's cold.\nIf you don't fancy coming on the walk, you can choose to stay in the hostel or explore nearby Lynton and Porlock Weir.\nSaturday evening:\nRelax and socialise or help out preparing the 2 course evening meal (included in the event cost) which we'll all enjoy.\nSunday\nAfter breakfast we'll help clean and tidy away leaving the hostel as we found it.  After that you can explore the North Devon Coast.\nACCESIBILITY:\nAs mentioned this hostel is accessible to wheelchair users, with a hoist system available in some rooms and we have the ability to make additional arrangements to support a carer attending if needed.  This means that whilst our walk along the coastal path might not be suitable, we would love to offer the opportunity to attend to someone that might not normally be able to join Outdoorlads events.  If this is you please reach out to\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nso we can ensure we can cater to all of your needs.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nOur location provider has asked that no nuts are to be brought onto the site.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "Work off the turkey with a Boxing Day walk around Totnes and the River Dart\nThe route is as follows:\n1. **Totnes Town Centre to the River Dart**\nBegin your walk in Totnes town centre. Head north out of town, crossing the River Dart. Take a moment to enjoy the view of the river, which has long been central to Totnes’s history and trade.\n2. **Riverside Path towards Dartington**\nFollow the path north-west, keeping the river close on your right. The route soon opens into fields and gentle countryside. Look out for wildlife along the riverbanks.\n3. **Into Dartington Estate**\nContinue towards Dartington. The estate is known for its historic hall, gardens, and ancient woodlands. You’ll pass through lanes and farmland here, with views across the valley.\n4. **Northern Loop by Staverton**\nSkirt towards the small village of Staverton. You won’t enter the village centre on this route, but you’ll be close to its edge. Here the walk loops eastwards, climbing gently before turning south. This section gives wide views across the South Hams countryside.\n5. **Heading South back to Totnes**\nThe return route follows quiet tracks and lanes back towards Totnes. You’ll cross the River Dart again near the railway, not far from the South Devon Railway line, where steam trains often run – a real treat if you spot one!\n6. **Final Stretch into Town**\nFrom the riverside, head back through Totnes’s historic streets to your starting point. There are plenty of cafés, pubs, and shops to enjoy at the end of your walk.\nAll photos taken by Outdoorlads members.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads For An Evening of INDOOR BOULDERING in Manchester!\nThis event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing.\nBouldering offers a wide range of benefits, including:\nPhysical:\nImproved strength, tone, balance, power, and coordination.\nMental:\nEnhanced problem-solving, focus, concentration, and body awareness.\nEmotional:\nRelaxation, a sense of achievement, and a feeling of mind-body connection.\nBouldering is also a fantastic way to meet new people and build lasting friendships, as it's an inherently social sport where climbers share tips and strategies to conquer the routes.\nNew to Bouldering?\nIf you're new to bouldering, it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader to learn the basics of safe bouldering. The leader can then introduce you to the rest of the group where you can refine your newly learnt skills in a social environment.\nExperienced Boulderer?\nIf you’re new to climbing with ODL, the leader will help to introduce you to the rest of the group so you can explore the centre together.\nYou are responsible for your own safety and actions while bouldering. Please use your own judgement when accepting advice from OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers, regardless of your bouldering experience.\nReady to boulder?\nYou will need to sign up on the ODL event page. We would ask you to do this each time so that the leader has access to important information\nIf you are not already registered with Rock Over Climbing, please do so\nhere\nto save time when you arrive. You only need to do this once.\nWhen you arrive at the centre you will need to pay for entry and hire climbing shoes if you don't own a pair. ODL members benefit from the concessionary rate so please mention this when paying.\nGet bouldering! You’ll find most of the group already bouldering so feel free to join them. If you’re new to bouldering with ODL, the leader will be looking out for you so if you spot them, please go speak with them first.\nAny questions?\nIf you have any questions, please contact the leader directly.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by\nSieh\nand joenellist.",

Whether you are new to climbing or a seasoned climber, this centre offers something for everyone with a huge selection of routes including top rope, lead and auto belay.\nPrefer to boulder? That's well catered for as well, with an extensive modern bouldering area ensuring there is plenty to keep you busy, or you can swap between climbing and bouldering on the same night.\nClimbing is the main focus of the event, but this is also a great chance to meet other members and build lasting friendships. Many Outdoor Lads members join through climbing, so if you're new to the group and want to know more, come along and chat over a cuppa during the tea and cake break.\nWhat to expect on your first climb with us?\nIf you are an experienced climber and have passed the centre's proficiency test, we'll pair you up with a climbing buddy and you'll be out exploring the centre in no time.\nIf you have never climbed before or think you could do with a refresher, we offer supervised climbing sessions with one of our leaders, subject to availability. That session will focus on introducing you to climbing, making sure you get plenty of time on the wall whilst also showing you how to belay safely. Due to the centre's rules, we are limited in the number of climbers the leader is able to supervise in each session so if you think you may need a supervised session,\nplease contact the leader before signing up to make sure there is enough space.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nAfter a few supervised sessions, you should be ready to complete the centre's proficiency test and once that has been passed, you'll be able to climb with the rest of the group.\nEverything else you need to know\nYou will need to register with Big Depot before your first visit to the centre but you only need to do this once. If you are an experienced climber, you can save time and do this online\nhere\n, selecting the 18+ unsupervised option. This also applies if you just want to boulder, just select the relevant options during the registration. If you are a beginner and require a supervised session, the leader will help register you when you are at the centre.\nPhotos provided by Sieh and Dexmonster.",

We'll pass through different parts of the forest, including a visit to St Stephen's Church , the \"Forest Chapel\", which has been on the edge of the forest since 1673.\nShutlingsloe:\nAt 506m, the perhaps hyperbolically nicknamed '\"Cheshire Matterhorn\", is a distinctively shaped hill south east of Macclesfield Forest and the highest point of our walk. The ascent isn't too long but is very steep, so we'll take our time with this section. Once on top, we'll be greeted with spectacular views of the rest of the Peak District National Park, much of Cheshireand Greater Manchester, and even as far as The Clwydian Range in North Wales.\nOther Infomation:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.",

    "Summary": "'A Yuletide Tudor Trail' was a possible title for this walk, because the shadow of the second Tudor monarch, his second wife and his second daughter will loom large over this festive foray around quiet lanes, along the valley of the River Eden and into the High Weald of Kent. We'll even finish at a pub named after him. As we proceed to Markbeech and then to Chiddingstone and back to Hever (alas, not seeing the latter's castle) we'll encounter cosy cottages, charming churches, tranquil tracks, whispering woodlands and pleasant pastures. The Christmassyness will climax at lunchtime at The Castle Inn at Chiddingstone when we'll banquet beneath the fifteenth-century beams.\nThe sights:\nMarkbeech:\nA small hamlet with a Victorian church perched high up on the northernmost sandstone ridge of the High Weald AONB.\nCowden:\nAll we'll just see of this place is the tiny, secluded Hole Cottage which is the remaining wing of a once much larger late-medieval hall house. Now a holiday cottage let by the Landmark Trust.\nChiddingstone:\nA unique and perfect example of a Tudor one-street village, so perfect, that the whole place is in the care of the National Trust. It's quite a film star too, as it featured in the 1985 Merchant Ivory film\nA Room With a View,\nMichael Winner's 1983\nThe Wicked Lady\nand the outdoor scenes of the BBC's 1971\nElizabeth R\n, starring Glenda Jackson. St Mary's Church is opulent, C14 and C15, and has the tombs to the Streatfeild family (you may have heard of Noel, the author) who lived at early C19 Chiddingstone Castle. The village takes its name from the Chiding Stone, a Saxon judicial place or boundary marker and place of public correction or 'chiding'. Plus, we're having lunch at the C15 Castle Inn - how cool is that?\nHever:\nMore pleasant timber-framed original and mock-Tudor cottages, including our last pub stop, the Henry VIII. St Peter's Church contains the tomb of Thomas Boleyn of Hever Castle, father of Anne Boleyn and grandfather of Elizabeth I. Unfortunately, we won't see Hever Castle, childhood home of Anne.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll follow a lane to Uckfield Lane which we'll soon leave to follow a footpath south through Oak Wood. Upon recahing Cowden Poubd Road we'll turn east into Markbeech, before following a footpath round to Horseshoe Green where we'll pick up a footpath to Buckhurst farm. We'll then follow Truggers Lane east then Rywell Road and Wellers Town Road north. We'll then be on Chiddingstone Road which will take us west to the pub. A permissive path through the grounds of Chiddingstone Castle will allow us to get to Hill Hoath Road which we'll follow south before picking up the Eden Valley Walk through Hever back to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields and woods for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know).

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Total distance about 17kms (approx. 11 miles) with 300m (850 feet) ascent throughout. Approximately 5 1/2 hours, including lunch.\nStarting from the charming Weardale village of Frosterley, this walk includes a range of delights. From several stretches of the River Wear to Limestone Quarries and exposed moorland with panoramic views, this walk is a joy.\nThe initial section of this walk is along the road, so care is required. After crossing the River Wear, we climb steadily towards Hill End. We take a short detour via a ford to enjoy the Low Bollihope quarry, before continuing our ascent. Most of the walk is on an estate track, so walking conditions are excellent. The peak of our walk is the Five Pikes trig point, which sits at 479 metres. We continue crossing open moorland and are likely to see grouse as we pass. There are stunning views across the North Pennines National Landscape towards Cross Fell. We take in the interestingly named \"Elephant Trees\" before descending down through White Kirkley. This stretch includes farmland, more former quarries and a final stretch back along the River Wear.\nAfter the walk, there will be an optional trip to The Bay Horse Hotel in Wolsingham for anyone who would like a drink.\nDogs: Well-behaved, under control dogs are welcome at this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever signposted, whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. Many stretches of this walk include sheep roaming. You'll need to make sure you're carrying sufficient extra water for your four-legged friend. We will meet natural water on parts of the walk. If you're unsure, contact the leader for guidance.\nIf the event is fully booked:\nPlease join the wait list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event,\nwe’ll make sure you feel welcome.

Then in darkness a steep ascent to the ramparts of the ancient Crug Hywel hill fort to get to the top of Table Mountain (451m). Another 340m of ascent will get us over Pen Cerrig-Calch (701m), to then find a place to sleep at an altitude of about 650m if the weather is kind. We’ll get up at dawn and then to the top of Pen Allt Mawr (719m), for an early morning panoramic view across all of the Black mountains; followed by Pen Twyn Glas (646m) and Mynydd Llysiau (663m) to get to the highest summit Waun Fach (810m).

    "Summary": "This 6 mile circular walk starts off in the shadow of Caernarfon Castle from the quay where thousands of tons of slate were exported during the 19th century. We will cross the river on the swing bridge and go to a viewpoint over the town, where the mountains of Eryri form an impressive backdrop. We'll then take the Wales coast path (a minor road at this point) which has lovely views of the Menai Straits for a couple of miles. After that we will head inland crossing a small hill with further views, and through some farms to pick up the course of the Welsh Highland steam railway where the trains which are pulled by very unique locomotives which articulate in the middle and have two sets of driving wheels to cope with the bends and gradients through the Snowdon Mountain Range. A footpath follows this back into the town. Caernarfon is a walled  town with nearby Roman origins, however the castle and walls were built in the 13C by the English King Edward 1st, after the ruler of Gwynedd refused to pay homage to the English. It is now a designated World Heritage Site and the imposing castle is one of the largest in Wales. Dolphins are often seen just offshore. The little streets within the town walls are picturesque and fascinating to explore. A short tour around town will round of the event and here we can also share a meal together. The meal is optional and a booking will be set up a few days before the event for those who wish to partake. It will probably be in an old pub, subject to availability and numbers; you will be messaged through the Outdoorlads message system to reserve your place for food.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified at least 24 hours beforehand in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.

    "People Attending": "20",
    "Summary": "This walk is a more challenging route, not for the fainthearted or those with less walking experience. A lot of the sections make use of unfrequented paths and there are several climbs (some that are fairly steep) spread throughout the walk.  If you are feeling fighting fit and want to test those legs, join Steven for this near thirteen mile rewarding round in the remote Yorkshire Dales.\nWaterfalls are a big feature of this walk and several are seen at close quarters, others glimpsed from afar. The deep valley of Upper Swaledale cuts into the Pennines and was justifiably chosen by Alfred Wainwright for his Coast to Coast route.  Mother nature has truly excelled here and the abandoned farmsteads just add to the feeling of isolation.\nWe follow part of Alfred Wainwright's route for almost a quarter of the walk , The leader walked this path on his first expedition twenty years ago, so expect many tales about this on the way downhill.\nThe walk starts with a climb up above the four hundred metre contour. There will be plenty of pauses for a breather/drink or photograph, Then, as the contours become kinder, extensive views are revealed on the watershed.  A lot of the nearby high Pennines are in view. Great Shunner Fell looks lofty from here and the limestone scars are seen at close quarters on the following descent.\nThe path down in the dale wanders through the maze of dry stone walls to the other side of the valley and, after a short break, another climb on an indistinct trail rises before a very gradual descent over grouse moor leads back to the River Swale and a small waterfall by a bridge.\nSeveral stone barns are passed as the route weaves up to the remote spot of Ravenseat. The farm has featured in a television series and the Yorkshire Shepherdess might greet us here.\nAnother slower ascent follows skirting a ravine before reaching a broader moor, passing another ruin and then above a tree-covered limestone scar descends to the opposite side of the Swale to Keld and a visit to a series of beautiful waterfalls.\nIf time allows, we will walk over to the inn on the other side of the village before doing the easy gradual descent of the walk.\nIf you would like a full day out and need a good bit of exercise please come along and see a remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales , You might be inspired to walk the 192 miles of the Coast to Coast yourself some time soon.\nThis route is suitable for well behaved dogs. There is livestock in many fields and there are some sections where your pet might need to be assisted over dry stone wall crossings.\nPhoto Credits - All photographs were taken by the walk leader.

    "Summary": "Much of the interest on this walk centres on the Battle of Bosworth, which was fought on the slopes of Ambion Hill and in the adjoining fields to the west of Market Bosworth.  The route passes across part of the battlefield, now a country park and well worth a lengthy exploration, I hope to find the visitor centre by lunch time so we can have good look round.\nAfter lunch we'll take the Battlefield Trail across Ambion Hill to Shenton Station.  Along the way illustrated panels show the positions of the armies and how the day unfurled.  The Battle of Bosworth, fought between the armies of Richard III and Henry Tudor on 22nd August 1485, is regarded as one of the most critical and significant battles in English history.  It bought to an end the 30 year long War of the Roses and is regarded by historians as marking the effective end of the Middle Ages, and was the last battle during which an English King died.  The victor ascended the throne as Henry VII, the start of the Tudor dynasty (and end of the House of Plantagenet).\nThe afternoon walk includes a tranquil stretch along the Ashby Canal as well as offering some fine views over the surrounding gentle countryside.\nFor over 300 years the Dixies were lords of the Manor, owning a large estate around the pleasant town of Market Bosworth.  This is still very evident today, with signs of Dixies here, there and everywhere.  This also has an interesting tale of what happens to some hereditary titles, the Dixie Baronetcy went extinct in 1975 when the 13th Baronet died with no male heir.\nGay History and Legend\nBy the time of Shakespeare, a century has past since the defeat of Richard III.  In the Renaissance period Richard is now firmly portrayed as the villain, fairly or unfairly we'll perhaps never know.  In the first episode of Black Adder, \"The Foretelling\", it explains that King Richard III was actually a kind, benevolent ruler who doted on his nephews and that his popular image as a murderous usurper is based on lies spread by his rival, Henry Tudor.\nShakespeare portrays Richard, in his wordplay as \"unfinished,\" ultimately Shakespeare enticing the audience of the time to conclude that Richard represents a figure that transgresses the margins of sexual polarities, making him a threat to the very essence of Renaissance gender identity.\nIn 1995, Ian McKellen, an openly gay actor who has fought Britain’s homophobic Clause 28, played Richard set in a fictional fascist England, in Richard Loncraine’s film of\nRichard III\n.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage Credits: All images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.",

Winter Camp was OutdoorLads' first EVER event back in 2006 and the perfect place to kick off our year of celebratory events! This year we are making it bigger and better than ever, with a choice of tents, pods, campervans or a hostel to bring together as many members as possible to launch the celebrations!\nThere are four accommodation options for this event, please ensure you book on to the correct one:\nTent pitch\n(this event page)\nMotorhome/Campervan pitch\nPod\nHostel\nWith the towering Langdale Pikes looming above it, our campsite is a particularly dramatic spot to pitch up for an adventure in the outdoors. The award-winning site offers a wide selection of grassy pitches as well as a collection of wooden camping pods. It boasts two newly upgraded toilet and shower blocks, washing-up areas, a laundry and drying room.\nThe name should give it away, but this is camping in the winter and so it will be cold! While it's not for the faint hearted, equally it's not out of reach of anyone. It goes without saying that you'll need to make good preparations to keep warm and dry all weekend, but having done that, you'll find that winter camping can be a great experience. Think mountain view, cold, and if you're lucky some snow, but also think roaring fires in great pubs with hearty food, good conversation with new and old friends, all making a memorable weekend.\nOn the Saturday there'll be a range of walk and activity options of varying difficulties. They will vary depending on the conditions at the time, but in this part of the country, every walk is a stunner and there are lots of options - very likely there will be a harder mountain walk and something a bit easier, but there will still be lots of ascent involved - this is the Lake District after all.\nOn the Sunday we hope you'll stay around for another, shorter walk. We aim to be finished around mid-afternoon.\nDepending on the conditions, there may also be the opportunity to learn/improve your winter walking skills as we have three great winter walking leaders on hand to share their knowledge and experience.\nOur campsite has great onsite facilities including a cafe serving early morning breakfast snacks and some truly great showers which are free to use, heated by the onsite Biomass boiler. Truly environmentally friendly! You will need to provide your own food EXCEPT for Saturday evening, as that meal is included in the price!\nBirthday Celebrations\nOn the Saturday evening at 6pm we plan to host a spectacular Hog Roast with all the trimmings and some more on the campsite.  The food is fully included in the event price, and there are other options provided for those with dietary requirements, don't worry!\nWe will have some marquees up for \"indoor\" space for socialising and you can of course being your own drinks but do bring a chair to sit on, the ground will be cold and/or wet.\nThis is a great chance to relax with your OutdoorLads friends, reminisce over the last 20 years,  laugh about the good times, the bad fancy dress decisions and the challenging climbs! It's likely a trip to a local pub will follow on from the hog roast.\nDogs\n: Well behaved dogs are welcome, must remain on a lead on site and owners will need to clean up after them. Dogs listed under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 are not permitted at National Trust campsites.\nPhotos:\nTaken by event leaders and used by OutdoorLads with permission.",

Winter Camp was OutdoorLads' first EVER event back in 2006 and the perfect place to kick off our year of celebratory events! This year we are making it bigger and better than ever, with a choice of tents, pods, campervans or a hostel to bring together as many members as possible to launch the celebrations!\nThere are four accommodation options for this event, please ensure you book on to the correct one:\nTent pitch\nMotorhome/Campervan pitch\n(this event page)\nPod\nHostel\nWith the towering Langdale Pikes looming above it, our campsite is a particularly dramatic spot to pitch up for an adventure in the outdoors. The award-winning site offers a wide selection of grassy pitches as well as a collection of wooden camping pods. It boasts two newly upgraded toilet and shower blocks, washing-up areas, a laundry and drying room. Please note that there is no EHU with these campervan spaces.\nThe name should give it away, but this is camping in the winter and so it will be cold! While it's not for the faint hearted, equally it's not out of reach of anyone. It goes without saying that you'll need to make good preparations to keep warm and dry all weekend, but having done that, you'll find that winter camping can be a great experience. Think mountain view, cold, and if you're lucky some snow, but also think roaring fires in great pubs with hearty food, good conversation with new and old friends, all making a memorable weekend.\nOn the Saturday there'll be two or three walk options of varying difficulties. They will vary depending on the conditions at the time, but in this part of the country, every walk is a stunner and there are lots of options - very likely there will be a harder mountain walk and something a bit easier, but there will still be lots of ascent involved - this is the Lake District after all.\nOn the Sunday we hope you'll stay around for another, shorter walk. We aim to be finished around mid-afternoon.\nDepending on the conditions, there may also be the opportunity to learn/improve your winter walking skills as we have three great winter walking leaders on hand to share their knowledge and experience.\nOur campsite has great onsite facilities including a cafe serving early morning breakfast snacks and some truly great showers which are free to use, heated by the onsite Biomass boiler.

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The route will be around the 10 mile mark (pub diversion included) and mostly on tracks and quiet lanes.\nEwelme is one of those quintessential Oxfordshire villages off the main roads that seems like it belongs in another time, with a stream running through it, which is used to grow watercress of all things. The school building here is the oldest in continuous use as a school in Britain.\nThe walk heads east out of the village and then north towards the oddly named Britwell Salome, following the Shakespeare's Way footpath, and then on to Brightwell Baldwin, another timeless village of thatched ivy-covered cottages, 17th-century pub and a classic red phone box.\nAfter lunch, we will make our way back south to Ewelme for a well-deserved pint at the Shepherd's Hut pub.\nDogs\n: Well-behaved dogs (and owners!) are welcome on the walks, do bear in mind this is agricultural countryside so there may be livestock and they will need to be on a lead if we encounter any. There are some busy road crossings to be mindful of also, and a few stiles.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.",

A chance to connect and network with other leaders, share ideas and tips, inspiration, motivation and review our 2025 plans and plans for 2026. There will be some help and guidance on offer to help upskill our leaders, and it's also a thank you from OutdoorLads to you for all you put into the organisation, without which - there would be no OutdoorLads! But don't worry - this IS NOT a weekend sat inside with post-it notes and flipcharts. The emphasis will be very much on getting outside, partaking in activities and getting to know each other!\nWe'll be staying in a YHA venue with dormitory accommodation and good social spaces. Located in Berkshire and a 5 min walk to the River Thames, the site has easy access to lots of opportunities for walking and cycling in particular. There will very likely be chance to visit a local public house over the weekend, as part of a social evening on Saturday night. As leaders, you may well be approached to run an event over the weekend for others to join in with - you have been warned! ;-)\nWe plan to make full use of the weekend, so please plan to depart from 12 noon onwards on the Sunday. For those who wish, there will be an optional Sunday lunch trip (you will need to pay for that yourself.)\nAlthough primarily aimed at leaders in the South East and South West / South Wales regions, this is open to any  of our leaders. A similar event aimed primarily at the\nCentral, North-East and Yorkshire, and North West / North Wales\nregions is taking place in the Peak District.\nTo note:\nThis event is heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads, and all food is provided over the weekend. However, travel expenses are not provided for this event. If that cost is a struggle for you, we don't want that to be a reason for you not to join us - please apply to the\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nfor help with that cost.\nAlthough the standard refund policy applies to this event, if you need to cancel, please do so as early as possible, so we can ensure the event is as full as possible with leaders who can benefit from the weekend.\nIf you are not yet a leader you will need to have applied and be well on with your leader application to join this event. If you're not sure if you should book or not, drop the office a line on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nand we'll chat it through with you.

As leaders, you may well be approached to run an event over the weekend for others to join in with - you have been warned! :-P\nWe have use of the venue until 5pm on Sunday and we are planning to make full use of the weekend, so please plan to depart from 1pm onwards on the Sunday. For those who wish, there will be an optional Sunday lunch trip  (you will need to pay for that yourself.)\nAlthough primarily aimed at leaders in the Central, North East and Yorkshire,  and North West / North Wales regions, this is open to any  of our leaders. A similar event for the\nSouth East and South West / South Wales\nregions is taking place in February.\nTo note:\nThis event is heavily subsidised by OutdoorLads, and all food is provided over the weekend. However, travel expenses are not provided for this event. If that cost is a struggle for you, we don't want that to be a reason for you not to join us - please apply to the\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nfor help with that cost.\nAlthough the standard refund policy applies to this event, if you need to cancel, please do so as early as possible, so we can ensure the event is as full as possible with leaders who can benefit from the weekend.\nIf you are not yet a leader you will need to have applied and be well on with your leader application to join this event. If you're not sure if you should book or not, drop the office a line on\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nand we'll chat it through with you. We will remove any bookings from members who are not leaders and haven't got an active leader application in.\nPhotos:\nW Allaway and used with permission.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.",

    "Summary": "Torridon - 3 nights\nJoin us for our annual winter mountaineering weekend walking in Torridon as we go in search of snow in the mountains!\nPlease remember that this is a winter mountain environment and we will be a small group. As such you should have a good level of fitness and be comfortable hiking in challenging terrain, using ice axes and crampons, as it is intended that we will be doing mountaineering in snow. If in doubt please message the event leader for guidance. The exact nature of activities on offer will be dictated by the weather conditions on the day - in the advent of adverse weather we will be doing low level walks in the local area as being on the mountain tops is not a place to be in wild weather!\nWe are staying in a bunkhouse at the head of Loch Torridon in among a collection of mountains that are highly regarded for their location and view, the big three being Liathach, Beinn Eighe and Beinn Alligin; but be warned even some of the smaller hills such as Beinn Damh to the south of the bunkhouse are also fantastic days out - what we do will be very much driven by the weather forecast. The hope is that there will be some snow about, and for that you will need to bring crampons and an ice axe - plus be proficient in their use.\nFor this bunkhouse you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Join us for the final Friday Fells of 2025 -  an 8 mile circular mountain walk (625m ascent) in Great Langdale.\nStarting from the National Trust Car Park at Elterwater, we'll asend gradually to our only Wainwright of the day, Lingmore Fell (469m).  On the way, we'll pass Burlington Quarry, which is the subject of an\nongoing planning battle\n, as (to the horror of many) they are currently trying to turn it into a Zip World attraction.  From Lingmore Fell, we'll descend to Side Pike, a mere Birkett at 362m, but nevertheless with stunning views of Great Langdale. To get to the summit of Side Pike, we'll need to remove our rucksacks to squeeze through a narrow rock crevice, aptly named \"Fat Man's Agony\" (other routes are available).  From Side Pike, we'll descend to the valley floor and pick up the Cumbria Way to take us back to Elterwater.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at\nThe Britannia Inn\n, and a chance to reflect on the 10 great Friday Fells events of 2025, before we take a break for the winter. Don’t worry though we’ll be back again in 2026!\nYou can find the planned route\nhere\n, though we may vary this depending on the abilities and ambitions of the group and weather conditions.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell-trained dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the\nCountryside Code\n.

Alternatively, some more dramatic mountain walking can be found within a short drive.\nThe activities:\nas we'll have two full days at our disposal, there will be an opportunity to take maximum advantage of this varied, beautiful region. Exact walks on offer will depend upon leaders attending, but will likely include at least one easier and one tougher walk each day. Wales' highest waterfall (Pistyll Rhaeadr) isn't far, with the adjacent Berwyn Mountains. Llangollen is always popular, as is the fascinating Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.\nNew Year's Eve:\nwhile this event is not intended to be a \"party event\", we will, of course, mark the arrival of the new year. Think dinner with friends, silly games, and general merriment :)\nThe accommodation\n: Our accommodation is well-equipped and comfortable, across a bunkhouse and cottages, with shared rooms of varying sizes (max. 8). Bedding is provided, but you'll need your own towel.\nDogs:\nThis venue is not suitable for dogs.\nOUTDOORLADS FOUNDATION\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Summary": "The Derby '\nNomad Way\n' is an 80 km (50 mile) recreational route circumnavigating the City of Derby. The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley\n- Sat 22 November 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey - 8.8 km (5.5 miles)\nWe will visit St. Matthew's Parish Church in\nMorley\nto discover some in-built remains from Dale Abbey and view the Sacheverell-Bateman Mausoleum. The (converted) Tithe Barn and Dovecote at Morley Hall are also of interest.\nTh Church of St. Andrew, much restored in 1875, retains a few Norman features from its 12th century origin, a 14th century font and interesting Jacobean Pulpit.\nStanley\nColliery, closed in 1959, was a drift-mine or 'footrill', nicknamed 'Nibbl'um or 'Nibby Pit' due to the coal-owners constantly cutting wages. In former times, the smooth white sandstone from Stanley Quarry was used to produce 'donkey-stones' used for polishing theshold steps. The 'White Hart' is open all day for refreshments.\nReturn bus service (Black Cat) to Derby available from Stanley.\nThis is 'The Flourish' and site of the former 'Stanhope Arms', on the old Derby-Nottingham route. Legend had it that the notorious outlaw Uthlagas preyed on the traveller s but after dreaming of the Abbey in Depedale, he became a reformed character and then lived as a hermit.\nWe will take short detour from the route to visit Derbyshire's only remaining wooden post-mill - The Cat and Fiddle Windmill - built in 1788, where we will have lunch at the\nWindmill Farm Cafe\n.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

A panoramic view of the City of Derby to the immediate south can be seen from here with the granite escarpment of Charnwood Forest on the horizon.\nThe high point on the Derby Nomad Way is reached here at 'The Common', 137m (482 feet) above sea level. A detour could be made here, via Coach Drive, for an opportunity to view the Millennium Topograph on Bunker's Hill behind 'Montpelier'.\nQuarndon was visited by Daniel Defoe in 1727, by which time the medicinal and 'curative' waters of the Chalybeate (Ka-Lib-e-at) Well had aquired rame and aspirations for the development of an important 'Spa'. A series of earth tremors, after around 1863, disrupted the 'spring' and the flow finally ceased from the Lion's Head Pourer following a major tremor in 1956. The ornate, castellated stone enclosure to the spring can be seen half-way down Church Road adjacent to the 'Joiners Arms'.\nReturn bus service (109, Mon to Say only) to Derby available from Quarndon.\nSt. Alkmund's Church in Duffield is adjacent to an ancient crossing of the River Derwent, south of the main village. This religious site, during Anglo-Saxon times, was probably a refuge for travellers. The earliest remains of the existing building are from the Norman period. Duffield Bridge was constructed in 13th century and subjected to later widening for the Chesterfield Turnpike in 1812. Looking downstream, dominating the skyline on the eastern bank, can be seen the brick chimney of Peckwash Mill. Originally a corn mill in 13th century but later, a paper mill of massive importance, being the largest producer of paper in the world during its heyday.\nReturn bus service (The Sixes) to Derby available from Duffield.\nOn the other side of the bridge we pass the 'Bridge Inn' pub.\nThe 'Derby Nomad Way' begins to share part of its route here with  the 'Midshires Way' and the 'Centenary Way' passing through Eaton Deer Park which existed during the Middle Ages.\nAt this junction, on the outskirts of Little Eaton between the main settlement and Coxbench is the 'Bell and Harp' pub.\nReturn bus service (7.1, 9.2 or Amberline) to Derby abailable from 'Bell and Harp'.\nIn the field, before reaching Morley Moor Farm, the route again crosses the line of Ryknild Street on its way north to Templeborough (Rotherham).\nThe 'Three Horseshoes Inn' is available here for refreshments at the end of the walk, if desired.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n*** Please note that Beginner sessions are run every two weeks ***\nIf you have never climbed before (or need a refresher on the basics), then this BEGINNERS EVENT is ideal for you! I will happily show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nEvent pages are split into\nBEGINNER & EXPERIENCED.\nPlease ensure you sign up to the correct event as only two beginners are allowed to be signed in to be supervised per leader.\nThis event is for beginner climbers (those needing to be supervised) only!\nIf you are competent with how to tie in & belay, then you will need to\nsign up to the accompanying experienced event\ninstead.\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nIf the event is full, please join the waiting list. If other leaders are able to attend, I may be able to increase numbers.\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event. Spaces for beginners are limited & 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing (or would like a refresher), there are plenty of top-rope routes to choose from after learning the essential climbing & safety techniques with one of our friendly, experienced climbing leaders.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

From the heights, the patchwork of fields, villages, and distant hills looks especially beautiful in the softer light of autumn.\nIt’s a walk that balances gentle climbs with rewarding vistas, perfect for catching up with your fellow hikers along the way. With the colours of the season all around us and good company at our side, this promises to be a refreshing day out in the Downs.\nTotal distance is 16 km (10 miles) with a 218 m (716 ft) of ascent spread throughout the route. We will be walking over dirt, grass, mud and tarmac.\nDogs\nThis walk is very suitable for dogs. There’s plenty of open space and several fields with livestock (dogs on leads in these areas, please).\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a scenic countryside and urban fringe walk taking in the green spaces, waterways, and heritage sites around Newton-le-Willows.\nThis walk is a relaxed ramble through a mix of canal paths, woodland parks, and historic village streets, offering a great variety of scenery and plenty of interest along the way.\nThe area is rich in industrial and natural history: once dominated by coal mining and railways, the landscape has been transformed into parks, nature reserves, and waterways teeming with wildlife. Along the route, we’ll see riverside paths, historic buildings, and maybe even some swans, sheep, and other farm animals as we cross into the more rural areas.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nSankey Valley Park & Canal:\nWe’ll follow the course of the historic Sankey Canal, one of Britain’s first, now transformed into a tranquil green corridor. Expect easy walking with plenty of opportunities to spot swans, ducks, and herons along the water.\nNewton-le-Willows & Surroundings:\nPassing through the historic town and Earlestown, we’ll see reminders of the area’s railway and mining heritage before heading out to Newton Common – a broad open green space with wide views of the surrounding countryside.\nCollins Green & Vulcan Village:\nThe route then loops into quieter farmland and the historic Vulcan workers’ village, where we’ll see cottages, rural lanes, and fields often filled with sheep or other livestock, giving a real taste of the area’s industrial and agricultural past.\nThis is a relatively flat walk with gentle terrain, making it suitable for a wide range of abilities. We’ll have time to stop for snacks and enjoy the scenery along the way.\nWe’ll finish the walk back in Newton-le-Willows, and for those who’d like to continue the day, we’ll head to\nThe Pied Bull\n, just 750m from the station. It’s a great spot for a drink together, and they also serve Sunday lunch if you’d like to stay for food.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are welcome on this walk, but please ensure they are under control at all times, particularly around livestock and in public spaces. Owners are responsible for their dogs, including cleaning up after them and assisting them over stiles or obstacles.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you’re very welcome to join us! This is a sociable and friendly walk, ideal for meeting other members. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to message me. You can also check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nIf the event is full, please join the waiting list as places often become available closer to the day.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Enjoy a pre-Christmas hike around the popular Happy Valley area of Coulsdon. The terrain will be varied and we'll see some stunning scenery on route. If that wasn't enough there are plenty of historic points and landmarks to keep us entertained. Near the end we can also enjoy a Christmas drink before our return.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nFarthing Downs\nThe most extensive area of semi-natural downland left in London.  Views are offered over a great distance.  There are also cows roaming freely as they graze.  History is also paramount here.  The site is believed to go back to Neolithic times with evidence of a historical past dotted around.\nSt Peter and St Paul Church\nWork started on the church before 1086 and it is still in use today.  The church is famous for having a wall painting believed to have been done around 1170.  Amazingly, the painting was only discovered during restoration works in 1870-1.  It has been described as “perhaps the most interesting ancient wall-painting in England”.\nHappy Valley\nThe general name for the whole area.  Originally, things were known as the Coulsdon Greenbelt Lands.  That is obviously quite a stuffy name so in 1970 the name was changed to Happy Valley Park.\nSt Lawrence's Hospital Burial Ground\nThe Caterham Metropolitan Asylum, later known as St Lawrence’s Hospital opened in 1870. Between this time and 1915 the burial ground was used to facilitate the hospital.  The site is now a place of history but graves and a memorial garden remain.  The site of the former chapel is visible.\nCoulsdon Common\nAnother lovely green space where fields and woodland meet.  As with other areas we pass through it is easy to forget we are in London.\nKenley Airfield\nRAF Kenley was a main operating airfield from 1917 to 1959.  It saw heavy use during both World Wars.  Sadly, few buildings remain and the Control Tower itself was demolished following fire in 1978.  That said it is thought to be one of the best preserved Second World War RAF fighter stations.  Some land has been used for housing but the site is still active.  The RAF 2 Flying Training School are still an active presence. Due to this the site falls under the Ministry of Defence.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can attend.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you. Please message me if you have any questions.\nLooking For More:\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of other walks taking place in the South East.\nCheck out this\nLink\nfor details of provisional upcoming events in the ODL diary.\n(All photos taken by the leader and permission is given for OutdoorLads to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "If you have ever joined OutdoorLads for our Penpont Canoeing activity you will have visited Glasbury on Wye, but Christmas gives us a chance to explore the village and surrounding countryside, and it will probably be a bit cold for the canoeing at this time of year!\nThe Brecon Beacons are a short drive away, so hopefully we can arrange car sharing for those that prefer a more mountainous walk, or perhaps a more leisurely walk taking in Three Cocks (The village of).  For the cyclists amongst you there is the challenging Gospel Pass Loop, or as Glasbury is located a whole 5 miles away from Hay on Wye  you may prefer a visit to the many bookshops there.\nThe Accommodation\nThis is our first visit to this location, but you can expect dormitory style accommodation with some spare beds available allowing us to spread-out throughout the building, and with a bit of OutdoorLads festive magic, we'll soon have the common areas looking like Santa's Grotto!\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect if this is your first OutdoorLads Christmas event.\nFriday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday, and find the bed you've reserved (more details on this closer to the time). Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge, with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be jacket potatoes with a choice of fillings, but we're not completely forgetting the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. We'd like you to bring along something for desert or an offering for a cheese board to be set out on both evenings.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge, or perhaps enjoy some board games (don't forget to bring your favourites).\nSaturday\nAfter breakfast on Saturday morning you'll head out on your choice of activity (we'll list these out below as they are confirmed), returning to our accommodation early afternoon. This means you will likely need a packed lunch that you will need to bring yourself.\nFor those of you that like your ParkRun on a Saturday morning, the nearest is Hay on Wye and we'll try to arrange drivers for those that need it and time our daytime activities to give you a chance to do both.\nOutdoorLads hostel events always rely on everyone mucking in and helping in the kitchen over the weekend and Christmas is no different, so whilst a few volunteers are busy in the kitchen, we'll hopefully have some Christmas themed activities in the lounge including our traditional Secret Santa.\nIt wouldn't be a Christmas hostel without Christmas dinner. and you can expect a starter, traditional Christmas roast, vegan option and all the trimmings followed by dessert.\nWe'll need some volunteers to clear up in the kitchen and dining room, but once that's done it will be a chance to relax and digest, there could be some music on but I'm sure the board games will be in full swing again.\nSunday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nOur plan is to offer a short walk or cultural event on the Sunday for those that are not in a hurry to leave, but this is subject to volunteers stepping up to lead this for you!\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Registered assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nCar Sharing\nChristmas is the time for sharing, so if driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way.   Why not add your details to the\ncar share pag\ne and we'll provide a Telegram Chat room nearer the time.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check out the South Wales and South West Calendar\nhere\n.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

For those who can stay a while longer on the Sunday, we'll plan to have a shorter day walk option available then too.\nAfter a great day outdoors on Saturday - potentially with a quick pub stop included - we'll be returning to base where we’ll be making the most of the evening with a good hearty Christmas\ninspired\nmeal, plenty of fun and laughter, some games and tunes to get us in the mood for the silly season, as we celebrate with our existing OutdoorLads chums and make some new ones too. Word has it that Santa may send an elf to help distribute the Secret Santa presents, and our old friend Kylie will as usual, be present to keep a watchful eye over proceedings.\nIn keeping with the Ghosts of Peak Christmases past, there will be NO Friday night buffet!  We’ll have tasty jacket potatoes and a range of fillings available for you on Friday night, so keep your quiches and mini scotch eggs at home!  Breakfasts is provided on both days, just don’t forget to bring your own lunch.

    "Places Left": "0",

    "People Attending": "45",
    "Summary": "'Hurst' in a place name means 'wooded hill', and these wooded hills will be stocked with seasonal shrubs such as holly, ivy, spruce and so forth. Starting by car or bus amid such woods we'll ascend Woolbeding Common, pause to appreciate the panorama, and then descend to the valley of the River Rother and the spick-and-span timelessness of the town of Midhurst. Here we'll split up and have an hour and a bit to find places to look at and lunch at. At a set time we'll meet up to complete the walk, finding further quiet corners, fir tree forests and historic homes (chief among them the imposing ruins of Cowdray House) and generally delighting in the Christmassy company of our fellow OutdoorLads.\nThe sights:\nHenley:\nA straggle of picturesque cottages and farms on the edge of Verdley Hill. There are superb views back to Blackdown Hill. The Duke of Cumberland Arms pub is C16.\nWoolbeding Common:\nOak, sweet chestnut, birch and rowan growing on the greensand give way to bilberry, gorse and heather. These areas don't feel like Sussex but more like the edge of Dartmoor. Birdlife includes green and greater spotted woodpeckers and perhaps resident linnets and stonechats. The heath has always provided local people with heather to burn and now the\nNational Trust\nis cutting back birch trees to prevent forest taking over the biodiverse heathland. There are superb views from the highest point across the Weald to the South Downs.\nWoolbeding:\nThe first village on the River Rother west out of Midhurst. All Hallows Church is tall, unaisled, Saxon, but restoration has removed most character and the chancel is from 1870. Woolbeding Hall is a delightful house of 1700, with French-looking additions of 1875. Home from 1972 until his death in 2006 to businessman, philanthropist and art collector Simon Sainsbury, and later his civil partner Stewart Grimshaw. The National Trust opens the\ngardens\n. Woolbeding Bridge is C14. Kinetic Greenhouse (it opens like a flower), 2021, designed by Thomas Heatherwick to display plants from the Silk Road. Cedra, water sculpture by William Pye, 2011.\nMidhurst:\nTo quote my go-to topographer Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n: 'To the main road traveller, Midhurst, like Petworth, is a bewildering series of acute ninety-degree bends combined with an inexplicable cottagey cosiness in the buildings, so different from the open market-places of Hampshire. Few towns are more deceptive, few towns withhold themselves so firmly until the traveller gets out of his car and on to his feet: few towns in particular have a more exciting relationship with the surrounding countryside'. The parish church (St Mary Magdalene and St Denys) is disappointing: some parts are C13, but most seems to be from the restoration of 1882. It overlooks a pleasant if rather empty square. The Spread Eagle Hotel is 1700, the Old Market House is C16, Market Hall (Now Eagle House) is 1552 with an C18 front. The former library is a ramble of tiled and timbered cottages of the C17. The biggest building is Cowdray House, just NE of the town, the epitome of sober but splendid Tudor architecture, dating from 1492 to 1542. It was left a ruin by a fire in 1793 and so spared from being Victorianized.\nEasebourne:\nA Cowdray Estate village (identified by yellow paintwork), mostly sandstone with some timber framing. Many good C19 estate cottages. Sycamore Cottage is C16 and the best of a mile of cottages that stretches up the village's High Street. St Mary is a priory church from the C13, but almost everything is now of 1876. Easebourne Priory was founded in 1238 and what is left are the buildings around the cloister which now form an amalgam of medieval, C17 and C18 design.\nThe\nroute\n(please click on the link in red to be taken to the Ordnance Survey website):\nThe westwards Serpent Trail will take us along Verdley Edge to the highest point of Woolbeding Common. Paths heading south will bring us to Eastshaw Lane which will bring us to Woolbeding village. Heading further south over the bridge, we'll almost get to the A272 and the western edge of Midhurst. After an hour exploring the town and finding food and a place to eat it, we'll meet up again, ascend St Anne's Hill, then proceed along the River Rother past Cowdray. A gravel track in the grounds of the house will take us to Easebourne where we'll walk along the High Street, then Easebourne Street north to Whitters Copse. At Verdley Farm we'll pick up a footpath heading west back to Henley.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, except that there will be a number of stiles to cross (you may have to lift your muddy beast over them), lanes to walk along, a few fields with livestock and the town of Midhurst where they might not be welcome in cafés (although being Sussex, they probably will). Any dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Whether on the neolithic Dorset Cursus, the Roman Ackling Dyke or the modern A354, people have crossed this comely corner of Dorset for centuries. But they have also known the value of lingering in this lovely locale, whether for a lifetime in the timber-framed cottages and stone-built mansions that outnumber the modern houses, or for eternity in the burial mounds that are as thick as the winter wheat. Our crossing and lingering will last just six hours as we complete this enjoyable jaunt, planned at the sweet spot where a fertile vale of sandy clay meets an expansive plateau of chalk.\nThe plateau is Cranborne Chase, which the route will touch on. The sixth largest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the country, and at the meeting point of Salisbury Plain, the West Wiltshire Downs and the Dorset Downs. Chalk is the predominant geology and chalk downland the predominant ecology, but the Chase has much variety.\nThe downs are named after the village of Cranborne, founded by the Saxons, which had a manor house and a small monastery. The word 'chase' comes from the hunts, undertaken by royalty (including Kings John, Henry VIII and James I), which took place on the downs. The Manor House is mostly Jacobean, rebuilt by Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, minister under James I, as a hunting lodge. A later inhabitant was Viscount Cranborne, former Conservative leader of the House of Lords. The church of St Mary and St Bartholomew is large, 12th century originally, now mostly 13th to 15th centuries with a massive 15th century tower and 14th century wall-paintings.\nThe archaeology in this area is prodigious. Wor Barrow is a large neolithic (\n3500-2500\nBCE) long barrow, excavated by the pioneer of scientific British field archaeology, Sir Augustus Pitt-Rivers in 1893-4. Ackling Dyke is the Roman Road from Dorchester to Old Sarum and the most impressive and best-preserved stretch of Roman road in Southern Britain. The agger (embankment) is over 2 metres high in places and the width is over 15 metres. It crosses the Dorset Cursus (a neolithic processional path associated with ancestor-worship) near the route of the walk. There are almost a hundred barrows (bowl, bell and disc) dotted all around, dating from the neolithic to the bronze age (1500-800BCE).\nAnd what of the sixpenny of the title? It is the village of Sixpenny Handley, known as just Handley until the mid-19th century, a pretty place with a mostly Victorian church (St Mary, 1877) and some handsome houses amid all the archaeology.\nThe\nroute\nstarts at The Square in Cranborne and then heads southwest along the Jubilee Trail past the Manor House and out to Creech Hill House. The trail then proceeds along Ringwood Lane to Wimborne Up Monkton and then veers west then northwest along Harley Down, past numerous barrows and crossing the Cursus and then northwest past Chapel Down Farm and then northeast to Sixpenny Handley. Leaving the village in a northerly direction and then an easterly direction we'll join the Hardy Way, cross Oakley Down and see Wor Barrow.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

    "Summary": "This is an enjoyable autumn circular walk starting from the popular location of Petersfield.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nWe'll leave Petersfield railway station and venture south east taking in an array of  historic buildings.  As we move out of the town we'll pass Petersfield Ponds, a lovely restored pond stretching for 22 acres  The town behind us we move through woodland mirroring the path of a stream.  After some distance we emerge on to farmland taking in some lovely views.  Reaching Durleighmarsh known for its popular farm shop we follow a road before branching off towards the quarry.\nLunch will be on a grass/meadow so please bring something dry to sit on.\nOnce refreshed we continue south venturing through both woodland and farmland.  There is a great mix of scenery and we really feel like we are away from everything.  We continue like this for some distance working our way back towards Petersfield.  As we get nearer there are more stunning views and plenty of varied landscapes.  We'll know we are nearly home when we get to Petersfield Ponds.  Here we then wind our way back through the town to the railway station.  Our walk will end here but I'm sure people may wish to grab a drink before leaving.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nThis particular walk does have a lot of stiles so please ensure your dog is comfortable with these.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend. Plans do sometimes change, but remember to free up your space so someone else can attend.\nNew Members:\nIf this is your first event or you are new to OutdoorLads we’d love to see you.

    "Summary": "On this circular riverside walk through Wapping, the Isle of Dogs, Greenwich, Rotherhithe and Bermondsey, we'll admire the feats of engineering and infrastructure that made London Docklands the busiest port in the world. We’ll trace the wood-built wharves, weathered warehouses, and winding waterways that once buzzed with tea and tobacco, coffee and cocoa, sugar and spice. We’ll enjoy the crisp air and festive cheer, with twinkling lights reflecting off the Thames. We’ll cross under the river via the Greenwich Foot Tunnel, and perhaps explore the Brunel Museum’s vault ('the eighth wonder of the world'). We’ll hug and huddle, celebrate history and heritage, and look ahead to the holiday.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll start our walk at...\n1. Tower Hill Underground Station:\nFunctional Victorian design; simple brick façade, understated compared to nearby Tower of London. The station sits above Roman-era city walls.\nWe'll then head east along Tower Hill and St Katherine’s Way to...\n2. Dickens Inn, St Katherine Docks:\nReconstructed C18 timber-framed pub. It wasn’t originally located here, being relocated from Shad Thames.\nGoing east along St Katharine’s Way to the dock entrance, we'll reach...\n3. St Katherine Docks:\nGeorgian warehouses converted into luxury marina housing. Noted for harmony of classical proportions with functional dock design. One of London’s first fully enclosed docks (1828).\nWe’ll walk northeast along St Katharine’s Way to the...\n4. Hermitage Wall:\nMedieval defensive wall fragment. Architecturally unremarkable, but historically significant as a rare surviving City fortification.\nThen we'll use the Thames Path heading east through Wapping to...\n5. Wapping Pier Head:\nIndustrial brick quay with iron fittings. Utilitarian aesthetic, little ornamentation but very elegant. The pier marks the former Wapping Basin entrance to the Thames. Used as a filming location in the Doctor Who story\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977), where the villain's henchman Chang searches for his master's Time Cabinet in the foggy London streets.\nGoing east along Wapping High Street, we'll get to...\n6. Wapping Old Stairs: C17\nriver steps. Narrow, picturesque, evocative of historic river commerce. Once a notorious smuggling spot. Used as a filming location in\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977) where an old crone leads the police to a mutilated body floating in the river, exclaiming: \"On my oath! You wouldn’t want that served with onions! Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Ugh! Make an 'orse sick, that would!\"\nHeading north along Wapping Lane, we'll find...\n7. Wapping Woods:\nA small green space amid former industrial land.\nWe’ll walk east along Wapping Lane and Thomas More Street, following the Thames Path to...\n8.\nTobacco Dock:\nAn 1811 warehouse designed by John Rennie the Elder whose use of brick and iron was praised for its elegance and durability. Later event-space conversions sometimes clash with its original proportions. Originally for imported tobacco, one of London’s largest bonded warehouses.\nGoing east along Wapping Lane and Narrow Street, we'll continue on the Thames Path through Shadwell to...\n9.\nShadwell Basin:\nC19 dock basin with simple brick warehouses. Now residential.\nWe’ll then walk north along Wapping Wall, following the Thames Path to...\n10. Prospect of Whitby:\nEvocative C16 riverside tavern with timber beams and low ceilings. Once frequented by sailors and smugglers.\nHeading north along Wapping Wall, we'll reach...\n11. Wapping Hydraulic Power Station:\nBrick and iron industrial structure, built 1890. Supplied hydraulic power to London docks originally by coal and steam, then by electricity. Exterior now overshadowed by surrounding modern developments.\nGoing east along Wapping Wall, using the Thames Path, we'll reach...\n12. The Grapes:\nEarly C18 riverside pub; elegant Georgian frontage. Charles Dickens referenced it in\nOur Mutual Friend.\nWe’ll walk east along Wapping Lane, Limehouse Link, and Aspen Way, following the Thames Path near the dock edges to reach...\n13. West India Docks:\nEarly C19 dock complex; William Jessop’s engineering praised for functionality. Major hub for Caribbean sugar and rum trade. Plain but elegant warehouses contrast sharply with nearby modern Canary Wharf.\nHeading northeast within West India Docks. we'll get to...\n14. Brown's Building:\nFormer warehouse with red brick and steel. Adaptive reuse for offices preserves industrial feel.\nGoing north along Hertsmere Road is the location of the...\n15. Museum of London Docklands:\n1802 sugar warehouse with John Rennie’s brickwork praised for its proportion. Preserves Docklands history and is converted sensitively.\nWe’ll walk east along Hertsmere Road and West India Avenue into...\n16. Canary Wharf:\nA landmark postmodern financial district masterplanned by César Pelli and Norman Foster in the late 1980s. Towering skyscrapers, including One Canada Square (235 m, 1991) and HSBC Tower (200 m, 1990). The glass-and-steel façades convey sleek modernity. Elevated plazas, public art, and interconnected pedestrian routes offer civic spaces, yet some feel the uniformity prioritizes corporate aesthetics over human-scale warmth.\nHeading adjacent to Canary Wharf we'll get to...\n17. West India Quay:\nC19 warehouses. Preserved dockside character amidst modern commercial redevelopment.\nGoing southeast along Aspen Way and Millwall Dock we'll reach....\n18. Millwall Docks:\nFunctional C19 dock basin. Now residential; retains water and quay walls. Warehouses’ architectural charm largely lost in redevelopment.\nWe’ll walk southeast along Manchester Road and Tunnel Approach, heading to Greenwich through the...\n19. Greenwich Foot Tunnel:\nEdwardian cast-iron pedestrian tunnel designed by Maurice Fitzmaurice. The elegant tiled interior seems narrow and constraining, but still a great engineering achievement.\nWe'll emerge from the tunnel to see the...\n20. Cutty Sark:\nAn 1869 clipper designed by Hercules Linton. Fastest tea clipper of its era. Sitting in a purpose-built dry dock which is partially successful: it preserves the ship for public viewing offering tourist-friendly walkways and interpretive spaces. However, the surrounding modern glass 'float' feels intrusive and the maritime connection is lost.\nGoing west along the Thames Path we'll cross Deptford Creek and cut across the Rotherhithe Peninsula and reach...\n21. Greenland Dock:\nC19 dock designed by James Walker. Now a marina with residential blocks.\nWe’ll continue west along Quebec Way and Albion Street to the...\n22. Brunel Museum:\nCommemorates the pioneering engineering of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his father Marc Isambard Brunel, particularly the construction of the Thames Tunnel (1825–1843). This was the first underwater tunnel beneath a navigable river, a groundbreaking achievement in civil engineering termed 'The eighth wonder of the world' by an American journalist. Entrance costs £9.50 and you get to experience the deep, wide Victorian tunnel shaft.\nHeading southeast along the Thames Path towards Rotherhithe Street, we'll see....\n23. St Mary’s, Rotherhithe:\nPretty brick exterior with classical detailing, designed by architect John James, an associate of Sir Christopher Wren. Construction began in 1714 and was completed in 1716. Due to financial constraints, the tower was not finished until 1747, when it was completed by Lancelot Dowbiggin.\nHeading west, we'll walk along...\n24. Shad Thames and Butler's Wharf:\nWarehouses built late C18–early C19 for tea, tobacco, and spice storage, feature tall brick façades, cast-iron galleries, bridges and hoists, They now house apartments and offices. Redevelopment preserves industrial character, Used in 1983 to film scenes from Doctor Who:\nResurrection of the Daleks,\nnotably the shooting of the prisoners and the pushing of a dalek out of a window.\nHeading north along Tower Bridge Road we'll cross...\n25. Tower Bridge:\nCompleted in 1894 by Horace Jones and John Wolfe-Barry, this bascule-and-suspension bridge combines Gothic revival detailing with functional Victorian engineering. Its twin towers, steel framework, and lifting mechanism exemplify industrial ingenuity, while its dramatic form creates a globally recognizable London landmark.\nGoing west beside the Tower we'll finish at the...\n26. Tower of London:\nFounded by William the Conqueror (1078), this fortress and palace evolved through Norman, Tudor, and Victorian additions. Its White Tower, defensive walls, and medieval towers reflect military strategy and royal authority. Historically a prison and treasury, it symbolizes monarchy, law, and London’s evolving urban landscape.\nTower Hill Underground Station is a little walk north up Petty Wales.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome on this walk but it's in an urban setting and so they won't be able to go off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

To keep your game-playing energy up the café serves food, soft drinks and alcohol. We usually have lunch there and then start playing (but there's no obligation to eat, if you don't want to!).\nI've booked a table at 1pm for eight for four hours. It's £8 each (paid to the cafe at the end of the session). We're a friendly bunch and it's always a good laugh. If you're new to Outdoorlads it's a great way to hang out with and get to know other members but in a cosy indoor setting.\n[Photos downloaded from Pexels or taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.]",

The full balance must be paid by 1st June 2026.\nFrom Friday 26th September, this event page will revert to showing the full price so people can book on and pay in the usual way, but we will also accept people contacting the office to ask to pay in instalments.\nSpend a week in the beautiful hills outside Rome and #getoutmore in Italy!  After almost 9 years, ODL returns to this beautiful 1,600 year old monastery 45 minutes northeast of Rome.  Fully modernised and capable of accommodating 12 guests, this building will be our base for a week of hiking and cultural immersion in the Lazio region.\nThis is a week away in Italy where the focus will be on getting out more and exploring the area on foot, enjoying the views and sights and the company of fellow OutdoorLads members; and a chance to enjoy the culture and tourist sights of Italy, too, rather than a chill-out holiday. So come and enjoy fantastic break away with us and get acquainted with this beautiful region!\nOur accommodation at the monastery features four twin-bedded rooms, and two double rooms (if you are coming as a couple or friends who don't mind sharing, please let the leader know!) and a full kitchen. Simple breakfasts, and tea and coffee are provided all week, as are two group evening meals. For the other evening meals you can self-cater, eat out, or those that wish to can shop, cook at eat together as a group - we can make arrangements for that when we arrive.\nNo transport is included, you will need to book and pay for all your own travel including flights and transport to the accommodation, and any transport whilst there. There is parking for four cars at the monastery if you wish to hire a car, but this would be at your own additional cost.\nItinerary and arrangements\nThe (adjustable) itinerary will look something like this. Please note that most tickets for attractions cannot be booked until at least 75 days in advance.  You would need to book and pay for tickets for any of these yourself, they are not included in the price.\nFriday 24 July\nShould you arrive at the monastery before 16.00, you will need to wait in the courtyard as there will be no access into the building.  I will meet the housekeeper at 16.00 and will need time to go through the preliminaries before allowing everyone in.\nThe train from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (Fiumicino Airport) to\nTivoli\ntakes around 2.5 hours, with a change required in Rome. Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around €11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli. Make sure you do not book to Tivoli Terme, as that is 30 minutes before Tivoli itself.\nThere are no activities planned for today, other than a communal dinner buffet.\nSaturday 25 July\nPlan on an early start to enjoy this (slightly longer than) 8.15km\nGrotto delle sirene\nloop through the village of Tivoli. We will walk down to the village from the monastery to the \"official\" starting point. This route covers very gently rolling village streets and paths, with an elevation gain of 160 metres and a loss of 150 metres.  Good trainers or walking shoes should should be adequate.\nLunch can either be brought from the monastery or can be purchased from one of the local shops.  Alternatively a trattoria lunch can be arranged at the end of the walk, as we will be in the village.\nSunday 26 July\nAs this is the last Sunday of the month the Vatican Museums\nMIGHT\nbe free (at least they were in 2025). If we decide to do this, the last entry into the Museum is at 12.30 so we would plan on leaving the monastery early, to try and avoid the queues as much as possible. Please note that shorts are\nNOT\nallowed inside the Vatican.\nThe Sistine Chapel is included on the free day, St Peter's Basillica is also free to enter but there will be security queues.\nAdditionally, for those interested there may be the option of attending the\nSunday Angelus\nin St Peter's Square, starting at 12.30. Please note that this only takes place when the Pope is in residence at the Vatican.  I will check the schedule as this day gets closer.\nFor those that prefer to stay at the monastery you will need to ensure that you have all your daily supplies as the shops and stores in Tivoli will most likely be closed today. There is the option of visiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n, but cannot be booked until Spring 2026.\nDinner may be a cookout at the monastery or some restaurants may be open.\nMonday 27 July\nAnother early start will see us exploring this 11.5km\nPonte Nomentano\n\"linear\" loop along the Aniene River. This requires the use of public transport (50 minutes by bus each way) or private car to the start / end point and that will be advised upon during the event.\nThis walk is completely flat, along the banks of the Anien River.  Good trainers or walking shoes should be adequate, but bear in mind there may be mud if there has been any rain. There are several restuarants / cafes at the 6km turn-around point that might work for lunch; we will just need to see what is open.\nTuesday 28 July\nToday will see us venturing into Rome to explore this ancient city.  Independent options could include:\nRome \"hop on - hop off\" bus tour;\nTickets\nshould be purchased in advance, starting at €26 per person.\nExplore the city on your own, taking in sites like Vatican City, the\nColosseum\n(multiple ticket options, starting from €53) or the \"\nEat, Pray, Love\n\" movie\nfilming locations\ntour.\nExplore\nSt Peter's Basillica\n(free to enter but there will be long security queues)\nFor the foodies you can try and visit the 13 best\ngelaterias\nin Rome!\nExplore the\nJewish Ghetto\n, which actually dates back to 1555 when it was created by Pope Paul IV Carafa.\nBe the ultimate tourist and toss coins into the Trevi Fountain (one coin \"ensures\" your return to Rome, two coins increases your chances of finding true love in the near future, and three coins ensures coins 1 and 2, as well as ensuring marriage in the Eternal City - coins must be tossed over your right shoulder using your left hand), walk down the Spanish Steps, or stroll down the\nVia Condotti\n(Rome's luxury shopping street).\nPartake in any one of the free (only pay what you want)\nwalking tours\nof Rome.\nAs the streets are virtually all cobblestone, good, solid soled shoes are highly recommended. Dinner this evening will be a special event (paid individually), at a restaurant in Rome to be decided upon later.\nWednesday 29 July\nToday we venture \"uphill\" from the monastery, taking in this 12.8km\nSughereta di Sirividola\nloop. This hike starts just down the main road from the monastery so no transport is needed. This hike is mostly on mountain paths, with an elevation gain of 460 metres and a loss of 450 metres.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nAnother option, if you so desire, could be returning to Rome to attend the free\nPapal Audience\nin St Peter's Square.  Again this is obviously ties to the Holy Father's summer schedule.`\nDinner this evening can either be communal back at the monastery or at any of the local tavernas.\nThursday 30 July\nToday is our last full day in this incredible location so let's make the most of it! For those that are not too knackered from yesterday's hike, there is this 8.45km\nTivoli to Monte Catillo\nloop through the hills above Tivoli. This hike should be a bit less strenuous than yesterday's but still has an elevation gain of 330 metres, and a loss of the same.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nFor those not interested in hiking today, cultural options include:\nVisiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n. Please note that you cannot book tickets until Spring 2026.\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the village, following any one of these 3\nitineraries\n.\nCompletely spoil yourself at the\nAqua Albule\nthermal spa, about 20 minutes by train from Tivoli. Use of the pool is around €17; full access to the thermal spa is around €45 and includes use of the sauna, \"flavoured\" and \"sailing\" showers (don't ask as I have no idea!!!) and hydrotherapy. Please note that ODL accepts no responsibility for your use of these facilities.  As always you should check with your GP to see if these services are right for you.\nDinner tonight will be a communal affair at the monastery, with a special \"theme\" to be announced early in the week.\nFriday 31 July\nSadly, our Roman adventure comes to an end today.  We will need to check out of the monastery by 10.00am, before which we will do the traditional \"ODL hostel clean\".\nIf you are flying back to the UK today please try not to book your departing flight before 16.00, as it is at least 2 hours on the bus / train, including a change in Rome.\nIf you are staying on in Rome for any additional days, please do not book your transport from Tivoli before 11.00, in order for everyone to participate in the clean-up.\nRome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is served by virtually every major airport in the UK, using EasyJet, RyanAir, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling and WizzAir.  Rome Ciampino Airport (approximately 1 hour south of Rome) is served by RyanAir (from Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and London Stansted - please note that flight days can vary).\nShould you wish to arrive in Rome before the 24th, or stay after the 31st, please note that all costs will be your own to incur and you will not be able to stay on longer at the monastery.\nIt is strongly recommended that you secure travel insurance to cover not only the hiking activities, but also flight delay or cancellation, baggage delays, medical care and, if necessary, repatriation.\nPay in instalments\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. This is how the event leader has chosen to pay - so it's no hardship.\nExamples of instalment options, but we're happy to discuss options with you:\nBook during October: Eight payments of £64.50\nBook during November: Seven payments of £73.72\nBook during December: Six payments of £86.\nYou will need to have fully paid up by the start of June.\nPhotos:\nPhotos provided\nwww.unsplash.com\n, OutdoorLads members and the monastery and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for an evening of Indoor Bouldering at Big Rock Bond in Milton Keynes!!\nIf you have not been to one of the Big Rock climbing centres you will need to pre-register\nHERE\n.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before...\nAs above, everyone attending the event must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nHow Do I Sign Up?\nIf you are not already registered with Big Rock, please do so\nHERE\n. As well as signing up to this OutdoorLads event page you will need to pay Big Rock for a session. This can be done on the day of the event at entry. As before, we'd ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n. Alternatively, stay updated on upcoming events using the social media channels below:\nTelegram\n(Climbing and bouldering only):\nOutdoorLads (SE) Climbing\nFacebook:\nhttp://fb.com/OutdoorLadsSouthEast\nTwitter:\n@OdlSouthEast\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Experience a magical world of Cotswold fairy-tale villages and a Christmas market! An idyllic start to the Christmas season.\nThis event is a day walk including a visit to the market. The walk starts and ends in the small town of Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, close to the border with Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. The town is full of historic yellow-stone buildings, some dating to the 1200s when a market became established. The Christmas market is open on this day only, with 60 little stalls selling hand-made wares and tasty treats. We will call by at the start and end of the walk. In the afternoon, music is planned led by the Cotswold Choir, and there is a light switch on.\nLeaving Moreton, we follow Monarch’s Way crossing farmland to the sleepy village of Longborough. This will be our lunch stop. You might be tempted in the little café at the village store, awarded\nbest Village Shop\nin the South West 2025. The centuries-old\nCoach and horses\npub also provides food and there is a bench on the corner here, and another by the churchyard, if you bring a packed lunch.\nAfter Longborough, the walk takes the Heart of England Way passing\nSezincote\nHouse. This extraordinary Cotswold stone mansion was built by the Cockerell family, some of whom had been to India with the British East India Company in the late 1700s. The house resembles an Indian Mughal palace, and you can clearly see the domes from the path just outside.\nThe next village we walk through is Bourton-on-the-Hill. This is a picture-postcard Cotswold village with listed cottages and church. Just outside the village the way skirts around Batsford Arboretum, an estate including Japanese maples, magnolias and pines.\nThe walk then returns to Moreton-in-Marsh where you can choose how long you wish to enjoy the flavours of the market and hear the music, before your return train or drive home. A most pleasurable Cotswold experience to prepare for Christmas!\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check our our\nSouth Wales and South West Calendar\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "About 14.5 km (9 miles) with 263 metres total ascent.\nThis is a proper north London hill walk that includes wonderful views from Alexandra Palace, Highgate (near Muswell Hill), Parliament Hill, Kenwood House, Hampstead Heath, and Golders Hill Park.\nFrom Alexandra Palace station we begin with panoramic views of the metropolis from Alexandra Park before heading to higher point near Highgate Village, on the brink of Muswell Hill, for more spectacular views. Much of the walk is through woods or on rolling grassland with several famous views out across London. We follow the picturesque route of an old railway line, through the ancient Highgate Wood, Queen's Wood, and on to elegant Waterlow Park with a glimpse of Highgate Cemetery. From there we head to Hamstead Heath, one of London's most glorious green spaces, climb Parliament Hill, then on to Kenwood House via Highgate Ponds. From the hamlet of North End, the final flourish of the walk is the Hill Garden Pergola and Golders Hill Park before we arrive at Golders Green station.\nAlexandra Park\nwas laid out in 1863 on the site of the ancient Tottenham Wood, part of the Great Forest of Middlesex. In 1868 it incorporated a racecourse, open until until 1970, the only course within London.\nAlexandra Palace\nwas built as a theatre, entertainment venue and ice rink. By an Act of Parliament, in 1900 it become publicly owned. The site is most famous for its association with the BBC, and the iconic transmitter mast from 1935. After (another) serious fire in 1980 the building was reconstructed and reopened in 1988.\nThe southern flank of\nMuswell Hill\noffers spectular views of the City and beyond from the top of a 17-arch viaduct.\nThe\nParkland Walk\nfollows the course of the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway's branch line which opened in 1873 to connect Alexandra Palace with Finsbury Park. At 4km is now the longest linear nature reserve in London.\nTry not to think of the infomous serial killer, Dennis Nilsen, who lived on Cranley Gardens nearby before we head into\nHIghgate Wood\n.\nWaterlow Park\nis something of a hidden treasure where, beyond the gorgeous slopes of green, there are views over the City and, depending on tree cover, even the dome of St Paul's Cathedral.\nHampstead Heath\nowes much to the Common Protection Society, and the founder of the National Trust, Octavia Hill, who helped to raise funds for the public purchase of more land, as well as the Hampstead Heath Extension Act in 1888.\nParliament Hill\nis one of the finest viewpoints in London. Originally part of twelfth century Tottenhall Manor, it got its name during the English Civil War when it was occupied by Parliamentarian soldiers.\nHampstead Heath's\nHighgate Ponds\nare the source of the River Fleet, now hidden away in the sewers of north London and the City until it reaches the Thames at Blackfriars. The ponds include single-sex swimming ponds and the Model Boating Pond.\nKenwood House\nis a Palladian masterpiece created by the renowned architect Robert Adam from 1754. In 1922 the house and its contents were auctioned. The (Lord) Iveagh Bequest Act of 1929 stipulated that Kenwood and its contents should be open to the public, free of charge.\nFormer Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder lived at\nNorth End\nbetween 1708 and 1788, and it is the location of The Old Bull and Bush pub, immortalised in the famous music hall song by Florrie Ford in 1904.\nHill Garden and Pergola\nhas been recently restored to embody the opulent spirit of the Edwardian Age. It was built by Lord Leverhulme who made his fortune from Lever Brothers. There are great views from here.\nGolders Hill Park\nis lush, green and undulating. A popular place, it boasts formal gardens, a deer enclosure, children's play area and zoo. The final view point of the walk is the top terrace and cafe.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

    "Summary": "Another exploration of the beauty of the Bradford district to celebrate\nBradford 2025 – UK City of Culture\n. This invigorating linear hike blends moorlands, the tranquility of woodlands, farmland with grazing animals. This is voyage through the rich heritage of the area.\nStarting in Shipley, the walk begins with a gentle climb through Baildon, tracing the course of Lode Pit Beck as it winds through wooded glades and past remnants of industrial heritage. The beck offers a tranquil start, with mossy bridges and shaded paths leading you toward the open fields above Baildon. As we ascend, stunning views are revealed across the Airedale valley and the landscape shifts from urban fringe to rolling countryside.\nFrom Baildon, the route continues through quiet lanes into Eldwick, passing stone cottages and the edge of Shipley Glen. The climb onto Burley Moor marks a dramatic change—heather and gritstone dominate, and the wind carries the scent of peat, bracken and wild heathers in bloom. The path leads to the Twelve Apostles, a Bronze Age stone circle perched high on the moor, offering sweeping views across Wharfedale and beyond.\nCrossing the moor, we'll reach Cragg Top, a large pictureque farmstead nestled on the edge of the uplands. The descent into Burley-in-Wharfedale is gentle and scenic, winding through wooded tracks and grassy lanes. The village welcomes you with its stone buildings and a sense of calm, marking the end of a richly varied and rewarding walk.\nThis route blends natural beauty, ancient history, and rural charm—perfect for those seeking solitude, inspiration, or simply a good stretch of the legs.\nWe'll take the Bradford bound train back from Burley-in-Wharfedale to our starting point in Shipley (£4.30 for a single ticket). For anyone travelling by rail via Leeds, you'll take the Leeds bound service (£6 for a single anytime ticket, advance tickets may be available).\nDogs:\nWell-behaved, socialised and under-control dogs are welcome on this event.\nWe'll be crossing some high stiles and farmers' fields with livestock so may not be suitable for all dogs.

    "Summary": "The Derby '\nNomad Way\n' is an 80 km (50 mile) recreational route circumnavigating the City of Derby. The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey\n- Sat 13 December 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley - 16 km (10 miles)\nThe Tower House, built in  1715 as a corn mill, was once th home of former Health Minister Edwina Currie whilst MP for South Derbyshire. The sails are gone.\nThe modern A38 trunk route follows the line of the Roman 'Ryknild Street' which is a branch of Fosse Way running from Boughton-on-the-Water in the Cotswolds to Templeborough (Rotherham) via the Fort of 'Little Chester' in Derventio (Derby).\nThe Toyota Factory is built on the former estate of\nBurnaston\nHall, purchased by Derby Corporation in early 1930's to build Derby Airport. During WWII it was a USAAF base and post-war became home of \"Derby Aviation\", the forerunner of British Midland Airways and bmibaby. The inadequacy of the grass-strip landing field and increase in civial aviation precipitated the construction of East Midlands Airport on the former RAF WWII Castle Donington Aerodrome which opened in 1964.\nThe Parish Church of St. Hellen contains the tomb of Sir John Port, founder of Repton School and also the adjacent Port Hospital Almshouses here the magnificent wrought iron gates by Robert Bakewell of Derby are now preserved. They originally stood at the entrance to Etwall Hall. Well-dressing was revived in 1970 and takes place annually in the middle of May. Public Houses serviing refreshments are the 'Hawk and Buckle' and the 'Spread Eagle'.\nReturn bus service (V1/V2) to Derby available from Etwall.\nThe Early English 'All Saints' Church largely dates from 13th century but contains 12th century stained glass of St. Michael, reputedly the oldest example in the country. The porch stonework shows evidence of arrow sharpening dating from the time of compulsory archery practice on Sundays.\nA new community grew near to here, at Lees, after\nDalbury\nwas abandoned during the time of The Black Death in the 14th century. A short detour into the village will lead you to the 'Black Cow' on the Green.\nAt Langley Common, the Roman Road of 'Long Lane', between the forts of Rocester and Little Chester, passes near to the 'Blue Bell Inn'.\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but owners must ensure they are kept under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked,\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

In the evening there are parties every nite some are themed (fancy dress) and are great fun. In between there is apres ski at the end of the day and the spa (if you have access) .\nFor more info:-\nEuropean Snow Pride website\n.\nEuropean Snow Pride on facebook\n.\nPLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO EUROPEAN SKIING EVENTS THIS ONE, (EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE ESP) AND EUROPEAN GAY SKI WEEK  EGSW SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNING UP TO THE ONE YOU WANT TO ATTEND , ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE BOOKED ON ONE. THIS EVENT IS FOR EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE in TIGNES\nThere is a WhatsApp group to assist people in communicating to book / share accommodation and to communicate and arrange to meet up whilst there. See the link in the location information below to join.\nPlease read the info on here carefully and on the ESP website, feel free to ask questions on the comments section below or in the whatsapp group.\nACCOMMODATION\nThere are lots of options see the\nEuropean Snow Pride website\nfor details.\nWhen booking for accommodation is open. I recommend booking ASAP as the best accommodation offers sell out early and the cost increases a little every month !\nThere are standard accommodation options that are eligible for the outdoorlads discount (\n€35 pp for non special offer accom booked with an Event Pass+6 day lift pass see\nODL Discount\n.), and there are the special offer accoms ranging from approx £400 to £700 these are already really good value so they are not discounted.\nYou will need to pay 25% on booking and the remainder 1 month before the event.\nI will be booking the deluxe special offer (£764pp (increases monthly)), a lot of the outdoorlads book this as is really good value and it makes shareing with other outdoorlads simple. The apartments are great, it is close to the slopes and it has access to the fantastic spa. This includes both event and lift passes. So just flights, transfers and spending money on top.\nThe apartments are for 5 people but you don't need to arrange who you are sharing with till later so I recommend booking to secure a place as this will sell out. (There are lots of other options and the non special offer accom is eligible for discount). If you are on a tight budget the standard special is great value at £500.\nIf you have got your own group together then great , if not message on the WhatsApp group , see link in the location information below to join the group, ask if any other outdoorlads are looking to share. With the special offer accom , snowpride will allocate you an apartment with others you request to share with and/or will fill spaces with others on snowpride. I have shared with others i didn't know in the past and found it a great way to make new friends.\nSKIING/SNOWBOARDING\nThere are daily guided groups for intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders and ski school available for beginners. This year each guided group will be accompanied by an ESP promoter and a professional ski guide from evolution 2.\nEuropean Snow Pride Ski options\n.\nYou can hire  your equipment  from ESP also.\nEVENT PASS ETC\nTo participate in the ski groups, a client must either purchase an Event Pass Premium, or an Event Pass Standard plus a supplement for ski and snowboard groups.\nThe standard includes the evening parties but not the daytime guided ski groups or the pool party.\nThis makes it more flexible so that if you do not use the guided ski groups or go to the pool party it will be cheaper for you. You can add the pool party or the guided groups to the Standard pass as an optional extra.\nIf you are intending to do the guided ski groups and pool party then it is more cost effective to get the premium.\nFull details on the types of event pass here;:\nhttps://www.europeansnowpride.com/fr/pass-evenement-gay-ski-week/\nGETTING THERE\nYou need to organise your own transport .\nSee\nEuropean Snow Pride travel options\n.\nWhen booking flights to the resort the transfers usually leave the airports before 3pm on Saturday and are not likely to arrive back at the airport until after 3pm on the return journey. So please bear this in mind when booking flights. (As in, early flight on arrival and late flight on return. There have been many occasions with a late return transfer as Saturday is change over day for the whole of the french alps! The traffic is usually extremely congested, do not be misled by google travel times that are not for Saturday! Several people have missed flights booked too early in the day.)\n(ESP photos copyright Franck Weens\nwww.weens.fr\nand Andréa Emmanuelli - Lezak\nwww.andrew-grey.com\nand European Snow Pride)",

    "Summary": "I sometimes have more than thirty attendees on my walks, but I will limit the numbers on this walk to thirty to make it manageable in a busy urban setting. If you're among the first few on the wait list, you should still get a place once folk start cancelling.\nWith 2000 years of history (sextons found Roman remains digging graves in St George's Cemetery), five centuries of architectural innovation, around ten architectural styles, and a reputation for radical, intellectual, affluential and regal characters, Bloomsbury is a fascinating area in London's West End. The architectural diversity has jeopardised the area's essential character, with modern and brutalist designs being built not just on bombsites but where Georgian and Victorian buildings were wilfully demolished, but despite this, the district is still known for its numerous elegant Georgian garden squares, and the brutalist intrusions have improved with age or now seem democratic.\nBloomsbury timeline:\nC1-C4:\nRoman remains show settlement near Londinium.\nC12:\nName 'Blemondisberi' appears, after William de Blemond was given land by William the Conqueror.\nC13:\nEstate passes to Carthusian monks.\n1530s:\nHenry VIII grants the abbey and its land to the Earl of Southampton.\n1660s:\nBloomsbury begins urban development; Bloomsbury Square laid out.\n1753-1759:\nBritish Museum founded and opens in Montagu House.\n1775–1783:\nBedford Square constructed by Thomas Leverton for the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford.\n1800–1804:\nRussell Square designed by Humphry Repton; Tavistock, Gordon and Woburn Squares follow.\n1823–1852:\nCurrent British Museum building constructed.\n1828-1836:\nUniversity College London and University of London established.\nEarly C20:\nBloomsbury Group meets in Gordon and Tavistock Squares.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll meet outside our first sight, which is...\n1. Russell Square Underground Station\n: Architect Leslie Green, built 1906. Distinctive oxblood-red terracotta façade, iconic of early Underground stations on the Piccadilly Line.\nWe'll then go west along Bernard Street and south down Russell Square to...\n2. Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel:\nOriginally the Hotel Russell, by Charles Fitzroy Doll, built 1898. Lavish terracotta building in French Renaissance style. The four queens sculptures are noteworthy. It is said to have inspired the interiors aboard the\nTitanic\n.\nWe'll then walk around...\n3. Russell Square Gardens:\nLandscaped by Humphry Repton for the Duke of Bedford in 1804. One of London’s largest squares, with fine plane trees and fountains, although some newer buildings (such as the UCL School of Education and the Imperial Hotel, which is being refurbished) have intruded.\nWe'll then walk south down Montague Street, west along Great Russell Street and south down Museum Street to the A40 and...\n4. Church of St George, Bloomsbury:\nBy Nicholas Hawksmoor, built 1716–31. Eccentric stepped tower or ziggurat topped with a statue of George I as a Roman emperor. Considered one of Hawksmoor’s finest Baroque works. Dramatic and wayward, elephantine at street level, and increasingly delicate as it ascends.\nWe'll then walk east along the A40 to...\n5. Bloomsbury Square Gardens:\nLondon’s oldest surviving garden square, laid out in the 1660s. Once fronted Southampton House, a Jacobean mansion that gave Bloomsbury its aristocratic roots.\nWe'll then walk east along Theobalds Road and north up Boswell Street to...\n6. Great Ormond Street Hospital\n: Britain’s first dedicated children’s hospital, founded by Dr Charles West in 1852. J M Barrie donated the rights to\nPeter Pan\nto it in 1929, funding the hospital in perpetuity.\nWe'll then walk east along Great Ormand Street to...\n7. Lamb’s Conduit Street:\nNamed after William Lambe, who funded a conduit here in 1577 to bring fresh water to Holborn, so a rare Elizabethan survival in Bloomsbury’s urban memory. Today has lively independent shops and cafés.\nAnd then to Millman Street for...\n8. Rugby Tavern:\nA rare survival of a historic pub on Great James Street, dating to the C18. Named for Rugby School, which once owned the land here.\nWe'll walk north up Millman Street, and west along Guilford Street to the...\n9. Site of the Foundling Hospital:\nSet up by Thomas Coram, a retired shipwright and sea captain was so moved by the plight of children abandoned starving in the streets that he campaigned for 17 years start a foundling hospital. Many of rank and nobility supported it, including Thomas Gainsborough, William Hogarth and Georg Frederic Handel. It was the first purpose-built children’s charity hospital in Britain (1739). We'll see the spot where the children of destitute mothers would be abandoned into the care of the hospital. The hospital was demolished in the 1920s, but some of its interiors survive. The Coram Foundation Playing Fields are unique in that adults using them must be accompanied by a child rather than vice-versa.\nWe'll go north across Brunswick Square to the...\n10. Foundling Hospital Museum:\nThe building dates from 1935-7 to house the collections and interiors from the demolished Foundling Hospital. It contains many works of art from patrons such as Gainsborough and Hogarth. Some of the most moving objects are the tokens - coins, buttons, jewellery and poems – left by mothers with their babies on admission, enabling the Foundling Hospital to match a mother with her child should she ever return to claim it. The overwhelming majority of the children weren't, and the tokens are in the care of the museum. The adjacent sculpture of Coram is by William Macmillan from 1963.\nGoing back on ourselves west to Hunter Street, we'll turn east down Handel Street to...\n11. St George’s Gardens:\nLaid out as a burial ground for St George’s Bloomsbury and St George’s Hanover Square, and a rare survival in that it is unchanged. Atmospheric Georgian garden cemetery. Contains the grave of Anna Cromwell, granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\nGoing back down Handel street, westwards, we'll enter the...\n12. Brunswick Centre:\nDesigned by Patrick Hodgkinson from 1966 to 1971. Brutalist 'streets in the sky' development, now Grade II-listed. There's a Waitrose here in which you could get lunch.\nLeaving the Brunswick Centre, we'll be on Marchmont Street, which we'll head north along to find...\n13. 57 Marchmont Street:\nChildhood flat of comic actor and diarist Kenneth Williams, above his father’s barber shop. Marchmont Street retains much of its C19 shopfront character.\nWe'll then walk west down Coram Street and south down Herbrand Street to get to the...\n14. Daimler Garage, Herbrand Street:\nFormer Daimler Car Hire Garage, by Wallis, Gilbert & Partners, built in 1931. Bold and suave Art Deco design with faience cladding.\nWe'll then go north back up Herbrand Street to Tavistock Place to see...\n15. Mary Ward House:\nA lovely Arts and Crafts design from 1897 by Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Claude Brewer. The Mary Ward foundation supports education, social reform, and community activities. Its architecture features handcrafted brickwork and masonry. Mary Ward worked to improve education and representation for the poor, but was a staunch opponent of giving women the right to vote, and in 1908 she became the founding President of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League.\nWestwards around the corner is...\n16. Tavistock Square:\nPart of Bloomsbury’s grid of Georgian terraces. Leads towards Tavistock Square, long associated with writers and reformers. The headquarters of the British medical Association is on the Square. We'll have lunch here in the gardens (or in the Pret opposite). The bronze bust of Virginia Woolf is a casting of Stephen Tomlin’s original 1931 sculpture from 2004. The statue of Mahatma Gandhi - depicting him in a meditative lotus position - is by Fredda Brilliant, unveiled in 1968\nWe'll then head further west to...\n17. Gordon Square:\nBuilt in the 1820s by Thomas Cubitt as part of the Bedford Estate’s expansion. Its residents gave the Bloomsbury Group its name. Virginia Woolf lived at no. 46, Lytton Strachey, essayist and biographer, also lived in the square as did the economist John Maynard Keynes and the author E.M. Forster. Other intellectuals regularly visited.\nAnd see at the corner of the square...\n18. Church of Christ the King:\nDesigned by Raphael Brandon in a Gothic-revival style, chiefly Early English. Now home to various Christian communities but under the Catholic Apostolic Church. Incomplete, lacking two bays on its liturgical west side (which prevented the construction of a façade), and the spire and full height of its tower are missing. We'll have time to explore.\nWe'll go up Gordon Street, then west along Gower Place, then south down Gower Street to...\n19. University College London:\nBy William Wilkins from 1826–30 who also designed the National Gallery. The neoclassical dome and portico (akin to his design for the National Gallery) were a symbol of progressive, secular education. It was the first English university to admit students regardless of religion, the first in the world to admit women, and the first to have an LGB society (thanks go to Steve Rowett for this information).\nWe'll then turn east along Torrington Place then south down Malet Street to...\n20. Senate House:\nBy Charles Holden (1937), soaring Art Deco limestone tower. Served as the Ministry of Information in WWII and famously inspired Orwell’s 'Ministry of Truth' in\n1984\n. It became 'Stuyvesant Towers' in New York, the location for Bertie Wooster's New York apartment in the ITV\nJeeves and Wooster\n. It is unlikely that Hitler personally wanted Senate House to be his headquarters in the event of Operation Sealion being successful, but being imposing and defensible it was identified by Nazi planners as a suitable headquarters for the German occupation government.\nWe'll continue down Malet Street to Montagu Place, then go west along it to...\n21. Bedford Square:\nThe most complete surviving Georgian square in London from 1770s. Uniform terraces, once fashionable residences, now mostly academic offices. 'Bedford Square' local lad Kenneth Williams enthused '...really is what Bloomsbury in its heyday was all about. Lovely rows of Georgian houses surrounding a garden. The garden itself providing an oasis against all the hubbub of urban life and aesthetically pleasing too.'\nAfter going round that, we'll head south along Bloomsbury Street to Great Russell Street and the...\n22. British Museum:\nBy Sir Robert Smirke, 1823-1852. The Greek Revival design is monumental and famous, but rigid. The collections inside are vast, diverse and iconic, yet often criticized for colonial acquisitions and a lack of contextual interpretation. Ian Nairn wrote in\nNairn's London,\n'Smirke was under the impression that architecture could be created by wrapping and great number of ionic columns around a big E shaped mass. It is putting together a building from the outside, instead of designing it from a central idea, and it never comes alive for a moment’. You'll get most of the afternoon to browse the museum if you want.\n(Picture credits: British Museum from the NE:\nPhoto\n©\nHam\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); Pediment, The British Museum:\nPhoto\n©\nPhilip Halling\n(cc-by-sa/2.0); Russell Square station, Bernard Street:\nPhoto\n©\nBryn Holmes\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bedford Square by Jeremysm (Public Domain); Hotel Russell, Russell Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Sones\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The cafe in Russell Square:\nPhoto\n©\nRod Allday\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Former Daimler Garage, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nSteve Cadman\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Mary Ward House, Tavistock Place, WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nMike Quinn\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Senate House, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nStephen McKay\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Church of Christ the King, Gordon Square, London WC1:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Osley\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Wilkins Building:\nPhoto\n©\nDiliff\n(\ncc-by-sa/3.0\n); St George, Bloomsbury:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "At 1550ft above sea level, Skiddaw House is the highest hostel in Britain. It was built around 1829 as a 'Keeper's lodge' and grouse shooting base for George Wyndham, the third Earl of Egremont. The building was originally divided into two separate dwellings; one side for the gamekeeper and his family and the other for a shepherd's family. The Earl and his shooting parties also had a few rooms to stay in when they came to visit. In 1986 the two dwellings were converted into the hostel it is today.\nSkiddaw House operated as a youth hostel from 1987 until 2002, when it closed and began to fall into disrepair again. But with the help of the previous hostel manager, many volunteers and the Skiddaw House Foundation, the hostel was renovated and reopened in 2007. The building retains many original features, which combined with its interesting history and remote location make the hostel a unique place to stay.\nOne of the great features of Skiddaw House is its remote location, offering stunning views of the surrounding Lakeland fells. This venue is an OutdoorLads favourite and is truly special, right from the moment you park up you'll understand why this is so glorious!\nHowever, the remote nature of the hostel means it is lacking the mod cons we may be used to, such as heating. Don't panic, there are a number of open fires throughout the building which helps keep it warm, but the bedrooms do not have any heating. Full bedding of 15tog duvets and pillow are provided but some may prefer to pack their own sleeping bag. Boots are also not allowed to be worn inside so we recommend packing slippers too!\nItinerary\nFriday Afternoon/Evening -\nArrive at the car park for 2:30pm, meet the rest of the group and we will hike up to the hostel together, sharing the load of weekend food supply bags. Please have your head torch handy in case we start to lose the light!  Once we have arrived and found our beds, there will be a briefing and we'll have the usual OutdoorLads buffet so please bring something that can be shared between two people (doesn't need to be complicated).\n(\nImportant note: You need to plan to be there at 2:30pm as we will then hike in together. We won't have scope to come back for stragglers and there is no phone signal at the car park. If you know you won't be able to meet at 2:30pm, please message the event leader before you book to discuss any other possibilities.)\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast will be available.  The main activity will be mountain walks (how many options we can offer depends on how many other mountain leaders book on). With hits like Skiddaw and Blencathra on our doorstep there are excellent options all around.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop your feet up and unwind from the days activities. We will be putting together a two course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.  While the hostel has a few, if you have a favourite travel size board/card game why not bring it?\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided once more then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am.  Once done we will take everything we brought back to the car park and then people might want to head home, into Keswick for an afternoon touristing, or if there is the demand there could be another walk offered.\nOther information\nBeds:\nThere are two double beds in the hostel (not in private rooms sorry!). Please let the leader know when you book if you are coming with a partner or friend you are happy to share a bed with, so that we can enable as many people as possible to join this weekend.\nDogs:\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs.\nSkiddaw House requires a 1 hour hike to access it from the car park. To ensure everyone arrives safely we ask that all attendees meet at the car park for 2:30pm Friday so that we can hike up together. You will need to carry everything you need for the weekend including food and drink, in one trip - so pack light!\nPhotos:\nProvided by event leader Neil (pacer142) with permission for use.",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "This hostel is aimed at mountain walking, and requires an hour hike carrying all your supplies plus an added bag, so a good level of fitness is needed",

The hospice was built in 1050 to shelter and rescue travellers crossing the pass.  Since the 17th century, the Saint-Bernard dogs have been bred by the monks of the hospice to come to the aid of travellers caught in snowstorms.\nNo prior snowshoe experience is necessary. You will be taught how to use the snow shoes on the first day on an easy trek into the Swiss mountain winter wonderland. If you have always wanted to get into the snowy mountains of the Alps but not been a skier take a look at this trip.\nThis trip starts at\nMartigny train station\nat 16:00 on the 12th March. There is a direct train from Geneva airport which takes about 2 hours.\nOur trip organizer (and OutdoorLads Member) Nick Read, is a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs\nPride Expeditions\n.  He first led an OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and a white water raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012.\nWhat is included?\nAll Accomodation\nUIMLA International Mountain Leader\nAll Breakfasts and Dinners\nEntry to\nBarry Land\na theme park dedicated to the dogs\nSnow shoes and walking poles\nSafety equipment  (including avalanche transceiver and shovel)\nWhat is not included?\nFlights to and from Geneva airport\nTravel to and from Martigny train station\nLunches and drinks\nInsurance - you will need winter sports insurance\nSledging or visit to Spa (optional extras are 25 CHF)\nMore information on this trip is available from the\nPride Expeditions website\nItinerary\nDay 1  (12th March 2026) Arrival and travel to Martigny for 1600\nOn arrival in Geneva there is a direct train from Geneva Airport to  Martigny train station which takes about two hours. We will be picked up there and settle into our hotel for the night. You will be given all the equipment you need for snowshoeing.\nDay 2 (13th March) Snow shoe skills journey  10km 500m of ascent and descent\nWe’ll complete a short journey into the Swiss wilderness in order to learn to use the snow shoes and how to move with ease. We will also cover safety aspects to ensure you stay safe during the trip.\nIn the afternoon you can relax with a glass of wine or visit the local spa. We will overnight for a second night in the hotel near Martigny.\nDay 3 (14th March) Journey to the hospice 7km with 600m ascent\nToday after packing our bags for the night we will ascend to the Grand Saint Bernard Hospice. We will have lunch with the monks then continue the journey crossing into Italy before heading back to the hospice for the night.

You will need to organize your own flights to Geneva and train ticket to Martigny from\nSwiss Rail\n.\nHow fit do I need to be?\nWe will be moving at a gentle pace when snowshoeing. Although it is a bit harder than walking it is not an extreme sport. We will be out in conditions that could be very bright and sunny or cold and snowy. It is more the ability to cope with these conditions that is important. If you would be happy going for a gentle winter walk in any conditions in the UK mountains you will find this trip straightforward.\nPhoto Credits: Tom Brodie for use to promote the event.\nHow to Book\nTo book your place on this trip (or secure a place on the waiting list) please pay a £215 deposit directly to\nPride Expeditions\n.

It is situated in the Northern part of Tanzania easily accessible from Kilimanjaro international Airport (JRO).\nMoshi, our base for the trekking phase of the expedition is right at the base of the mountain and caters well to tourists with lively bars and a comfortable hotel for us. This trip is a 7-day Machame route and includes a 2-day Safari to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.\nThis price for this iconic trip is £2850 per person including food whilst trekking and on safari.\nThe 7-day Machame route is a beautiful route that comes highly recommended. Due to its ascent profile and longer duration it offers plenty of opportunity for acclimatisation. It has a high summit success rate and get’s you off the well-trodden routes. We will be fully catered in our camps by a team of chefs who will prepare all our food in a cook tent and serve us in a dining tent.\nWe will be camping for six nights on the mountain.
