We will meet at Southwick Station, with frequent trains stopping along the Southern Coastal line and is also on the London Victoria mainline to Littlehampton via Hove. The walk is easily accessible by coastal bus routes from Littlehampton, Worthing, Shoreham-by-Sea and Brighton.\nWe will walk for 50 minutes or so to reach the beach at Shoreham Harbour (unofficially clothes optional), at which point we will pause for 20-30 mins a dip in the sea for those who might fancy it. We will reach the Railway Inn, Portslade at around 8-8.15pm and stay there to eat, drink, and socialise. From there, there are trains aplenty back to the start point, or home, or it's a 10 minute walk back to the coast to take the 700 bus back to Southwick.",
    "Difficulty & Distance": "We will be walking 3.2 miles on shingle and tarmac. The event is suitable for most abilities and levels of fitness but you do need to be comfortable walking on shingle..",

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement.

We have a choice of routes to Alderley Edge, either a short very steep climb or a much longer gentler climb, either route brings us to the ridge where we can make a short walk to a fine view point from the sandstone cliffs over the Cheshire Plain. The route can be decided on the day, based on the group preference.\nAfter descending from the Edge, we can take another short break at Redesmere Lake, before passing through the villages of Siddington, Lower Withington and Goostrey en route to a cafe/lunch stop at the Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope.\nOur return journey will take us through Chelford before an off road section to avoid main roads, before another visit to Alderley Edge, but no climbing this time as we pass through the village.\nThis event is around 27\nmiles\nand is reasonably flat except for the hills around Alderley Edge. Whilst the majority of the route is on quiet lanes, please note we do pass through Wilmslow on some busier roads.\nWe have plenty of time to complete the route and we will take it at a relaxed pace and no one will be left behind.\nRoad cyclists:\nPlease be aware some paths might be a little rough and bumpy for thin tyres, but doable none the less.\nMountain bikers:\nThe majority of the route will be on paved surfacing, so knobbly tyres will be a little over kill for the ride, but don't worry it will be at a slow pace.\nPace and Terrain\nThis will be a leisurely cycle suitable for those of all levels of fitness. The majority of the route is on quiet rural lanes, with some short off road sections. This event is open to cyclists of all abilities and bike types. There is a significant climb near the start to Alderley Edge, otherwise the majority of the ride is relatively flat, with just a couple of small hills en route, but nothing too long, and no harm if you need to walk up them.\nIf you're not a regular cyclist, please do make sure your bike is in good condition - check the tyres are well inflated, chain is oiled, and you've got a spare inner tube, drinks and snacks with you.\nEvent images:\nAll images were taken by the event leader and permission to use them is granted to OutdoorLads.\nKeep in Touch\nIf you'd like to hear about our cycling events as soon as they are published, then subscribe to our Social Media & Instant Messenger channels.\nFacebook\n,\nTelegram\n,\nTwitter\nYou can chat with our members on\nFacebook\nand\nTelegram\n, and join our\nStrava\nclub\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event.",

It's fairly flat route through inclosures and across open heath and woodland. A little bit of road where they will of course need to be on a lead. There will be livestock in areas - so please be aware.\nFrom the shattered hulks of ancient trees come new life. Bracken fiddleheads unfurl from mats of brown fronds. The air rings to the sounds of bullfinch, goldcrest and Dartford warbler. The miracle of summer comes round again.\nAll of the New Forest's landscapes will be seen: from bog and stream to heath and wood, from grazed grasslands and enclosed parklands to oak thicket and pine plantation, while at the centre of it all, and at half-time and lunchtime, we'll see the 'capital' of the Forest: Lyndhurst.\nThe first half of our\nroute\ninvolves heading west to Lyndhurst. We'll walk through Longdown Inclosure, over the railway line, across Matley Heath and along a path parallel with the Beaulieu Road over White Moor. This stretch of the walk contains some of the best scenery in the Forest. We will have lunch at the Beaulieu Road Inn, I won't book a table as we'll probably eat outside, they welcome well behaved dogs. We will then make our way back across the heath to Longdown.\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "The Climbing Academy is one of the best bouldering centres in the South West. With over 200 problems in a 750 square metre area there is enough to keep even the avid of boulderers occupied.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' as they are referred to tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport. For this reason, it is often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nTo come along, you will need to register via the event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive. For entry fee prices go to:\nhttps://www.theclimbingacademy.com/prices/\n. As we start at 8pm you will pay the off-peak price.\nFor your first time climbing with us, especially if you are a novice climber, please contact the event leader in advance to let him know what your skills and experience are.\nIt is important that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nClimbing and Bouldering Participation statement\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement, here\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Outdoor Lads for a summer hike in the north of Eryri National Park, ascending the mountains of the Northern Carneddau.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nLlyn Anafon:\nDuring our ascent, we'll follow the Anafon River to Llyn Anafon. The river itself is a habitat to many freshwater invertebrates and fish. The llyn is currently the site of a rewilding project to restore it to a more natural state, encouraging the growth of native water plants and the reestablishment of a thriving trout population.\nLlwytmor:\nStanding at 849m, our first hill translates to English as the 'Ash Sea', due to its flat grey boulder strewn summit. From the top, we'll have panoramic views over Anglesey, The Irish Sea, and even The Lake District and Isle of Man should the weather be clear.\nFoel-fras:\nAt 944m, our highest point during the walk translates to 'Broad Hill'. We'll again be greeted by stunning sea views to the North, as well as views of the Carneddau to the South. The mountain is also of ornithological interest, being one of the best places in Wales to see Dotterels on their spring migration, which also peaks the interest of upland raptors such as Peregrine Falcons.\nDrum:\nAt 771m, our final summit translates as 'Ridge', despite it being a very rounded hill. From here we'll get more sea views and mountain panoramas as we make our descent.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants. If we do see them, make sure not to approach too closely, as they are wild and shouldn't be frightened.\nAber Falls Distillery:\nAt the end of the walk, we can visit the local distillery, which has a cafe, selling cakes, hot drinks, and of course, whiskey.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Help Cumbria Wildlife Trust maintain the network of paths around this amazing reserve - between Coniston and Morecambe Bay. The reserve is a lowland of heath, grassland and fen areas which are home to a range of specialist species. It's dotted with ponds containing the rare medicinal leech.\nThe day will involve clearing the network of paths which cross the Common, helping visitors to explore the area and directing footfall to less sensitive areas, so benefitting wildlife too.  All tools will be provided, just bring along a pair of work gloves if you have them.\nLowick Common Nature Reserve is made of a number of special habitats. The eastern half of the reserve is characterised by the ponds and meres that follow its length, and the craggier, rocky nature of the ground. The western half of the nature reserve is different, with a more rolling, undulating ground crested with several ridges that run down the slopes here. The ponds are one of the few places in Cumbria to have medicinal leech.  They're also habitat for great crested newts and 15 species of dragonfly and damselfly, including beautiful demoiselle, emperor and black darter. The rest of the nature reserve is a mixture of lowland heath, lowland acid grassland and some lowland fen areas. These habitats are home to a range of specialist species including butterflies like Small Pearl Bordered Fritillary, and reptiles like slow worms and adders. The scattering of trees and shrubs across the main area of reserve see bird species like redpoll, spotted flycatcher and yellowhammer during the summer months.\nThe view from the top of the beacon towards the south of the nature reserve is spectacular. From the top you can look north to the dramatic hills and passes of the Lake District.  To the south you have the whole of Morecambe Bay before you, with the distant Pennines and Forest of Bowland on the horizon. On a clear day you can see over 15 miles north and at least 30 miles to the south.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a Participation Statement, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a summer hike along the Dane Valley Way, through the countryside and nature reserves of Cheshire.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nThe Dane Valley Way:\nThis 77km long distance footpath follows the River Dane from Buxton to Northwich. We'll be walking along the section between Congleton and Holmes Chapel; hiking through a mix of farmland, woodland and wetland along the way.\nAstbury Mere Country Park:\nFormally a sand quarry, the country park was opened in 1991, and is now home to an impressive mere, where wetland birds and mammals live. The mere is also a large water sports and outdoor education facility, making it an import asset for locals.\nBrereton Heath Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve consists of mainly silver birch and oak woodland surrounding a large lake, as well as areas of heathland, a wildflower meadow and wetland areas. Many bird species live in the reserve, including great spotted woodpeckers, nuthatch, treecreepers, kingfisher, heron, great crested grebe and goldfinch. This will also be our lunch stop, with a farm shop onsite run by the local dairy farmers, selling homemade milkshakes and ice cream.\nSwettenham Village:\nThis lovely little village was founded in the 12th century, and also has an impressive 13th century church, St Peter's. Next to the village is the Lovel Quinta Arboretum, with a huge collection of trees and plants, some of which we'll be able to see as we walk around the village.\nHolmes Chapel:\nThis is where we'll end the walk. The village has another interesting old church, St Luke's, a grade 1 listed building dating to the 15th century. We'll also pass the impressive Hermitage Viaduct as we walk into the village. There a several pubs we can go to for post walk drinks.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We’ll then descend to the river and reservoirs at Oak Dale (watch out for the pheasants…..just think Jurassic Park with very small vegetarian Velociraptors!). After a short ascent through the trees we’ll then descend and make our way along the river at Middlestye bank into the village.\nAfter a stop in Osmotherley, we’ll head up to Lady’s Chapel. Built by Carthusian Monks in the 15th Century, it’s a great place to stop to absorb the tranquillity with views through the vegetation across to the eastern Yorkshire Dales! We’ll then continue along the Cleveland Way, again with views across to the Dales and Roseberry Topping as we wind round to the northern extent of the North Yorkshire moors.\nWe’ll then descend along the bridleway at Swinestye Hill back to Cod Beck Reservoir and the car park……hoping the ice cream van is there….and the coffee/tea van if that’s your thing after a long walk!”\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The aim is to reduce the vigour of bracken, which if left unchecked would smother other flora beneath it.  Without management, grass growth would be suppressed resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Bracken bashing enables flowers such as orchids and common harebells to thrive and to provide nectar sources for bees and butterflies.\nOur day will start with a safety briefing from Forestry England before we are let loose on the bracken.   We'll have a break for some lunch and after a few hours of hard work we'll find a local pub to enjoy a well deserved drink.\nAnd of course there will be cake!\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

With panoramic views across Weymouth and Portland to the south and Dorchester and surrounding areas to the north. Walking along the chalk down then down through the valley back to Dorchester.\nThe massive ditches and banks of Maiden Castle, stretching across a saddle-backed hilltop 914 metres long, are the end result of many centuries of modification and enlargement during the Iron Age.\nThe first early Iron Age (800–550 BC) hillfort enclosed only the eastern end of the hill, with a single rampart and a V-shaped ditch. The original rampart was probably dumped earth, stone and chalk from the ditch, but a complex timber revetted wall flanked the two entrances.\nIn the middle Iron Age (550–300 BC), a much larger area of 19 hectares was enclosed including the western end of the hill, allowing more people to live within the defences.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Lancing also has a train station served by trains stopping along the Southern Coastal line and is also on the London Victoria mainline to Littlehampton via Hove.\nWhilst we will be meeting at 6.30pm, the hope is that the weather and tide will favour a dip in the sea for those who are keen. So we will likely chill on the beach for half an hour, and start walking towards Shoreham around 7pm. We will reach the Longshore pub within the hour, and stay there to eat, drink, and socialise. From there, it is a short 15 minute walk via the Shoreham houseboats on the River Adur, before arriving at our end point in the heart of Shoreham-by-Sea.

Therefore numbers are limited due to capacity and I have booked us in.\nWe will take the ferry across the river (£2 payable per person), which may involve a wait.\nNo dogs are allowed due to the visits to Marble Hill House and Pembroke Lodge/Gardens.\nOverground and District Line closed that day, but accessible by mainline trains.\nThe route\nLeaving Richmond station, we’ll walk across the Green via the remains of the Palace to the River Thames. Following the busy river path, we’ll reach historic Marble Hill House for our visit and early lunch. We will cross using the foot ferry to Ham House, then head through Ham Common and Woods to enter Richmond Park. In the Park, we will take in Isabella Plantation, Pen Ponds and Pembroke Lodge Gardens and King Henry’s Mound. On the return to Richmond, we’ll stop to admire the views from Richmond Hill Terrace Gardens, before returning to the river and an optional pub stop in town.\nThe sights\nRichmond on Thames\nDespite being just 8 miles from London, Richmond preserves its character with an expansive green surrounded by Queen Anne and Georgian houses leading to an archway, which is all that remains of the former Palace. The Palace was rebuilt during the 1440s: Henry VII died here in 1509, Henry VIII used it until Hampton Court was acquired, it was given to Anne of Cleves and Queen Elizabeth I died here in 1603. Most of the Palace was demolished by 1660.\nMarble Hill House (visit included)\nhttps://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/marble-hill/\nPlease note we are booked in for a free flow visit (not guided), admission free. We will have 1 hour to explore\nwith time for an early lunch and you may wish to visit the gardens and cafe.\nWe will visit the Palladian Marble Hill House, which was built in 1702 for George II’s mistress Henrietta Howard. In her earlier life, her father had died in a duel, and her marriage was a disaster, but she rose to become the King’s official mistress with her own court. The restoration of the House and Park was completed by English Heritage in 2022.\nRiver Thames ferry and Ham\nThere is a £2 charge per person and we may need to queue to cross.\nWe will cross the Thames using the foot ferry.  We will see the outside of Ham House, which was built originally in 1610 following the gift of land by Charles I, and its interiors have hardly changed since then. Elizabeth, the daughter of the original owners, secretly helped Charles II in exile during the Civil War, but retained the house by keeping Oliver Cromwell on side. 17th century gardens have been recreated and surround the house, which we can see through the gates.\nWe will NOT visit the interior or gardens of Ham House (NT).\nRichmond Park\nRichmond Park was originally enclosed by eight miles of walls by Charles I, but public access was only secured in 1758 by John Lewis, a local brewer (not the retailer). There are over 600 deer, and the Isabella Plantation was created in the 1950s with streams, and a colourful collection of azaleas and rhododendrons. It’s London’s largest Royal park, largest Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve.\nAt Pembroke Lodge Gardens, we will visit King Henry’s Mound which boasts a 10 mile direct and protected view of St Paul’s Cathedral, enjoy the views over the Arcadian Thames, and look for Poet’s Corner with a bench dedicated to Ian Drury (“Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick” and “Reasons to be Cheerful”). There are two cafes here also.\nA map of the park can be seen here:\nhttps://www.royalparks.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/Richmond-Park…\nRichmond Terrace\nThe Royal Star and Garter Home adjoins the terrace and was built by funds (and jewels) donated by women as a memorial of men who went to war, opening in 1924.  The view from Richmond Hill is protected by Act of Parliament.\n“Here let us sweep\nThe boundless landscape... to where\nMajestic Windsor lifts his princely brow\nIn lovely contrast to this glorious view\nCalmly magnificent, then will we turn\nTo where the silver Thames first rural grows...\nHeavens! What a goodly prospect spreads around\nOf hills, and dales, and woods, and lawns and spires,\nAnd glittering towns, and gilded streams, till all\nThe stretching landscape into smoke decays.”\nFrom THE SEASONS, James Thomson\nThe route\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website):\nhttps://explore.osmaps.com/route/22975802/richmond-marble-ham-and-park-updated\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring walks get really busy so please only book if you know you can make it.

There will be an optional visit to the wine shop at Denbies at the end of the walk.\nThe route\nWe will leave Dorking surprisingly quickly and the first part of the walk is dominated by Denbies vineyard, which we will walk through. After climbing gradually on a quiet lane on the North Downs Way, there will be extensive views over the vine covered slopes to Box Hill and Dorking. Passing the monumental St Barnabus church, we’ll reach Denbies Hillside for views southwards stretching from Gatwick, Dorking and the Greensand Ridge to Leith and Holmbury Hills, where we’ll stop for a picnic lunch.\nTurning north, we will descend through the National Trust’s Ranmore Common estate through managed woodland and narrow paths. A gradual descent on a quiet lane takes us to Westhumble.\nI plan on stopping at the Stepping Stones pub for a drink. You have some options here: (a) Stay with the group for a drink and walk back the picturesque route via Westhumble village and Denbies vineyard; (b) return by yourselves early to Dorking station by walking 20 minutes along the main road (pavement); or (c) stay yourselves at the pub and take the train from Box Hill & Westhumble station next to the pub (to London Victoria or Horsham).\nOption (c) above reduces the walk to 6.75 miles for those returning by train to London.\nThe sights:\nDenbies Vineyard:\nDenbies is the biggest (single estate) vineyard in the England covering 265 acres and producing over a million bottles of wine. It has developed into a major tourist attraction and we will walk via public footpaths through the vineyards with views over its slopes to Box Hill as we climb up the chalky hills, reminiscent of the Champagne region.\nRanmore Church and Denbies Hillside:\nThe estate was once owned by Thomas Cubitt, the architect who designed Queen Victoria’s Osborne House and nearby Polesden Lacey, before it was finally broken up in 1984 between private ownership (including the establishment of the vineyard) and the National Trust. Ranmore is known as the church of the North Downs, designed by George Gilbert Scott and contains a memorial chapel to Cubitt’s three sons who died in the First World War. It may not be open, but is rather striking from outside. The hillside is protected chalk downland and there are sweeping views of the Mole Valley, the tower at Leith Hill (which takes that point to over 1000ft or 305m) and the nearby towns of Dorking, Wooton and Westcott.\nRanmore Common and Westhumble:\nThe woods are managed by the National Trust as part of the much larger 1600 acre Polesden Lacey estate. The village is quiet other than the station (which has fewer trains than Dorking) and the Stepping Stones pub. We plan on visiting the pub; the name is misleading as the stepping stones over the River Mole are further down the road, and we’ll need to save those for a Box Hill walk.\nThe route\n(please click the link\nhttps://explore.osmaps.com/route/17183380/go-west-to-wine-and-woods-and…\n; to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website).\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is ideal for them, although there may be agricultural equipment at the vineyard, some fields with livestock and some roads to walk along, though they will be quiet lanes. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The Smestow Valley - A brief history\nThe Smestow Valley\nwas formed at the end of the last Ice Age. The Smestow Brook flows through the area opened up by glaciation, which removed part of the ridge, creating the\nAldersley Gap.\nIt effectively forms a boundary between the catchments for the Trent and Severn rivers. In fact the glacial action shifted the Smestow Brook from the Trent to the Severn catchment.\nThe Smestow Brook\nrises from it's source at Water Street in Park Village at the site of the old Springfield Brewery. It drains, Wolverhampton, South Staffordshire and parts of Dudley , and it is the most important tributary of the river Stour, forming part of the Severn catchment. The brook flows over glacial gravel beds, but for the greater part runs over sandstone deposits. These are permeable and the size of the brook is deceiving as most of it's water flows underground. This is further evidenced by the number of it's tributaries that may be familiar to you: The Spittle Brook, Dawley Brook, Holbeche Brook, Wom Brook, Black Brook, Perton Brook, Finchfield Brook and Graisley Brook.\nTwo\nRoman sites\nwere built along the Smestow, with the larger Greensforge, where two camps utilised the brook as part of it's fortification.\nThe\nAnglo-Saxons\ncleared this land for farming. They were the first permanent settlers in the valley. From the middle ages, locally produced charcoal and the availability of water gave birth to a local Iron industry.\nThe first references to the valley were made in the 14th Century, when the area was known as \"smetheslall\" and\n\"Smethestalle\",\nand even by the 19th Century, it was still referred to as\n\"Smestall\"\nin surveys, meaning\n\"place of the Smiths\".\nThe lower Smestow was lined with bloomeries and forges, with the brook water being used for cooling and later to power forge machinery in the local areas.\nThe\nFoley family and Dud Dudley,\nmade fortunes locally and the latter carried out the first trials using coal as a substitute for charcoal in Iron production.\nThe Oxley to Kingswinford Railway\nwas originally owned by the\nGreat Western Railway\nand one of the last stations to be constructed by the company now forms the ranger station at the main entrance to the Smestow Valley Local Nature Reserve, off Henwood Road. Work began on the station in 1913.\nThe railway ran as a passenger service  between 1925 and 1932, before becoming a goods service until it closed on 24th June 1965. The line had also served as a World War 2 ambulance train service.\nThe Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which runs along the length of the valley was designed by\nJames Brindley\nand opened in 1772. Water power was so important to the valley, that when the canal was being constructed, Brindley's plans to cut off the natural flow of Smestow Brook were blocked  and he was forced to construct the\nDunstall Water Bridge\nto carry the brook over the canal, so maintaining it's natural course. The canal served to heighten the attractiveness of the valley to industry, allowing major Iron works to be created at Swindon and Gothersby, the former continuing until 1976.\nIt maybe potentially muddy in places and recommend walking boots or appropriate footwear to be worn.\nDogs\nare welcome on the walk, however will need to be on a lead at times.\nThe route\nis 11.1 miles / 17.8km\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nPhotos:\nAll photos taken by walk leader and other ODL members used with permission.",

It can be made easier or harder depending on the line taken - if you follow the ridge line closely, it is a more difficult scramble but, if you take one of the lower by-pass paths, it is less challenging.  If you have never scrambled before, this could be a good one to try because of the flexibility.\nAfter warming up by walking across the lower slopes, we will start to climb steeply up Hall's Fell - at first, on a mountain path, but soon reaching the ridge and the scrambling section.  We will probably split the group into two for  this section with one group following the ridge line and the other taking the easier options.   Once we get to the top, we'll join back up and enjoy exploring the summit area and coast back down the easy graded path the car park, enjoying the views as we go.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at the\nHorse & Farrier Inn\nin Threlkeld.\nYou can find the route\nhere\n.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nEveryone's dog is different, but this walk unlikely to be suitable for most dogs due to the nature of the terrain.\nImage\n/\nphoto\ncredits\n:  All images (c) JPV with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A leisurely loop from Levenshulme\nTake it easy on this relaxed 19-mile circular ride to Park Bridge and Daisy Nook Country Park, with plenty of green views, quiet trails, and time to soak it all in.\nWhether you're new to cycling or just in the mood for something gentle, this ride is for you. We'll roll along at a friendly 8–10 mph pace, with no one left behind.\nThe Route\nStarting in Levenshulme, we’ll follow the scenic Fallowfield Loop to Fairfield and on to Ashton town centre. Then we’ll join a converted railway path towards Park Bridge—a former ironworks site now surrounded by greenery and history. We can pause here for a breather, depending on how the group feels.\nNext up is Daisy Nook Country Park, a beautiful mix of woodlands, canals, meadows, and lakes. From there, we'll wind our way through Failsworth’s Woodhouses area and into the nature-filled trails of Clayton Vale, following the River Medlock to Phillips Park. Then, it’s a calm cruise up the Ashton Canal and back onto the Fallowfield Loop to Levenshulme, where we can round off the day with a well-earned drink or bite to eat.\nTerrain & Suitability\nThe route is mostly traffic-free or on quieter roads, though we may briefly encounter some busier sections. There are a few gentle climbs and mixed terrain: ideal for hybrids or mountain bikes, but still doable on a road bike with care. Some areas can get muddy, especially after rain.\nPlease ensure your bike is in good working order—you’ll be responsible for fixing any mechanical issues that arise during the ride.\nImportant: Participation Statement\nBefore attending your first cycling event, you\nmust complete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition to booking your spot.\nPhoto credits: All photos taken by OutdoorLads leaders and used with permission.",

It would be a joy to welcome\nODL members\ninto our inclusive group, which embraces\nall genders and sexualities,\nwith regular participants from Hampshire and frequently visitors from far and wide. Together, we can create\nheart-warming experiences\nand nurture new connections within our community.\nIf you can’t make it on\n6th June\n, don’t worry!

I look forward to dancing with you!\nW̲h̲a̲t̲ ̲i̲s̲ ̲B̲i̲o̲d̲a̲n̲z̲a̲?̲\nDuring Biodanza sessions we bring our awareness back to our body, which helps us to discover and experiment with new forms of movement expression in fun ways, and open us to giving and receiving consensual touch, which can create a strong sense of comfort and affirmation for each other.\nIn Biodanza there are no set dance steps to learn - we are not seeking to perform, the key is to connect with rhythm and our creative expression.\nBiodanza is open to all experience levels - from those who could be curious to try Biodanza to those who are on a deep development journey through the practice. Biodanza is full of choice and invitations, which means that it can be adapted for people from all ages, backgrounds, fitness levels.\nBiodanza FOR GAY, BISEXUAL and TRANS MEN\nBiodanza can be particularly beneficial for men for several reasons:\nEmotional Expression\n- it encourages emotional openness, helping men to connect with their feelings and express them within a safe space.\nStress Relief\n- Biodanza features movements and music that can reduce stress and promote relazation, fostering our overall well-being.\nImproved social connection\n- Biodanza promotes bonding and community, it's a non-verbal practice, where everybody's individuality is recognised and celebrated. This can help to circumvent typical barriers that may be otherwise present in our everyday social environments.\nEnhanced Body awareness\n- Biodanza fosters deeper connection with one's own body, this can improve our body image and self-esteem.\nCreativity and playfulness\n- Biodana encourages creativity and spontaneity, to help explore and experiment with our playful side.\nSupportive Environment\n- The inclusive and supportive nature of Biodanza can allow that men feel safe whilst exploring and understanding our vulnerabilities.\n𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘆𝗲𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗕𝗶𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗻𝘇𝗮?\nYou are welcome to contact me to ask any questions.

According to legend, each knight has a horse - pure white in colour. However, at the time the knights were placed in their enchanted sleep, the wizard whose job it was to watch over the king and his men found that they lacked one horse. One day, a long time ago, he encountered a local farmer taking a pure white mare to sell at the market.  After the farmer's initial refusal to sell, the wizard bought the horse and the farmer was paid a generous price in gold from the king's secret store of treasure under the Edge.\nWhilst the Wizard may be legend, there is no disputing the fact that\nAlderley Edge\nis a great location for walking.  The Edge is a dramatic red sandstone escarpment, clothed with attractive woodlands.  It rises from the Cheshire plain with impressive views west, north to the city of Manchester and to the Pennines beyond.  There is a long and fascinating history of small-scale\ncopper mining\nin the area, with activity dating back to the\nBronze Age\n.  Mining continued intermittently from Roman times to the 1920s.  Below the Edge and the surrounding countryside lie an extensive network of underground natural caves and mines.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs may come on the walk, but must be under control at all times and on a lead when walking through fields with livestock or where wildlife might be disturbed.\nWe will be walking through fields where there will be sheep and cows, so if your dog becomes excited in the presence of livestock, this walk is not suitable for them.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPhoto credits\n: photos by the event leader with permission given to OutdoorLads for their use.",

This will also be my first lead as a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader so please come along to support me!\nThe Sights:\nHenley-On-Thames:\nis a town renowned for its vibrant river life and Georgian architecture. The world famous Henley Royal Regatta will be commencing the week after this hike so no doubt preparations will be well underway\nHenley Park:\nis a historic country house and landscape garden, originally established in the 13th Century as a deer park. We will be walking through the parkland as we leave Henley-On-Thames\nStonor House And Deer Park:\nhas been the home of the Stonor family for 850 years, making it one of the oldest family residences still in use. The deer park is home to a herd of fallow deer. Although we won’t be visiting the house or Italianate-style gardens, we will still get views of the house and grounds may get to spot some deer\nSouthend:\nno seaside, pier or references to TOWIE here, this is a small and unremarkable hamlet (marking the halfway point and lunch stop) and is part of the parish of Turville, synonymous with The Vicar of Dibley\nHambleden:\nis a picturesque Bucks village known for its brick-and-flint cottages and has a rich history dating back to the Domesday Book of 1086. It’s a popular movie and TV film location with productions including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, 101 Dalmatians, Goodnight Mister Tom and Midsomer Murders. Option for tea, coffee and cake here at our three-quarter mark\nMill End And Hambleden Lock:\nwe access the Thames Path crossing a wide section of the river across a bridge and weir at Mill End to Hambleden lock, with views back to Hambleden Mill\nThames Path And Henley Royal Regatta Course:\nthe final stretch will include the world-famous rowing course measuring 1 mile and 550 yards over a straight racing line and in use since 1839. At the start of the course you’ll find Temple Island with its Etruscan-style temple designed by James Wyatt in 1771.\nHenley Royal Regatta:\nduring this period Henley hosts one of the highlights of the English summer social season with world-class rowing, elegant hospitality tents and a black-tie music festival. The regatta and festival will be commencing the following week, so as we return to Henley, you will see the various tents and stands being readied\nThe Route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Henley-On-Thames Railway Station we will briefly walk through the town headed for the Oxfordshire Way, taking us North-East, firstly up a steep hill and then a flat stroll through the parkland of Henley Park. Continuing along the Oxfordshire way we will eventually go steep downhill into Middle Assendon.\nFrom Middle Assendon we continue through roads, paths and tracks to Stonor, where we join the Shakespeare’s Way, following a steep uphill section skirting past Stonor House and Deer Park. After a long climb ascending 400 meters we will eventually reach the hamlet of Southend where we will stop for lunch.\nAfter lunch we continue on trails, with a number of wooded sections, to eventually arrive downhill into Hambleden, which is a scenic village and has a shop where we can get refreshments including tea, coffee and cake.\nFrom Hambleden, it’s flat for the remainder of the walk, firstly a meadow section following the Hamble Brook and finally we will follow the Thames Path back to Henley-On-Thames including the regatta course section. Optional pub visit to the Anchor Inn at the end!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This walk uncovers some beauty and interest (and allows a swim) amid the sprawling seaside suburbia typical of the south coast. Half the walk will be suburban but half will be rural. First, we'll cross Highdown Hill, which is more prominent topographically (the views are superb) and mythically (the resting place of Saxon kings) than its modest height of 81 m suggests. Second, and after a visit to the freebie Highdown Gardens, we'll cross bungalowland to see flint cottages and farms and a private estate. In the latter, a house designed by a Bauhaus master and then an art deco garage will bring a dash of international chic to all the mock-Tudor mansions.\nThe sights:\nAngmering:\nBuilt inland on two hillocks with a green inbetween. Not yet swamped with houses like its seaside suburb of Angmering-on-Sea at East Preston. St Margaret's Church is mostly by noted architect SS Teulon, as is the school and vestry hall opposite. All display his characteristic complex planning and polychrome brick, except for the C12 chancel arch and tower. A very pretty village centre with flint cottages, manicured lawns and lush planting.\nHighdown Hill:\nA small but isolated promontory off the main South Downs belt, just 81m high but giving great views. In the property of the National Trust and the traditional burial-place of the Saxon kings of Sussex. Late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC) enclosure and early Iron Age (around 600 BC) hill fort. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery with around 90 graves has been excavated. In the C18, local miller John Olliver had his tomb built on the hill 27 years before his death in 1793. It is said that he was the leader of local smugglers and used the tomb to store contraband. He would set the sails of his windmill at different angles to indicate the absence of customs men to his followers out at sea. A runaway millstone from Ecclesden Mill is said to have given its name to a local farm and now garden centre.\nKingston Gorse:\nIn Angmering parish, a private estate of 'individually designed houses built after 1930 but mostly 1960s or later larger replacements offering a good chance to see many cliches of domestic design' (The Buildings of England - Sussex: West (Williamson, Hudson, Musson and Nairn)). Of the three best houses of the Modern Movement, only one is visible: Sea Lane House, 1936-7 by Marcel Breuer with FRS Yorke. Marcel Breuer worked at the Bauhaus where he was mentored by Walter Gropius before working in Britain between 1933 and 1938. His most famous work is the Wassily Chair.\nFerring:\nAn old flint cobble village swallowed up by seaside bungalows, typical of the Sussex coast from the Witterings to Lancing. The core, by the C13 roughcast church of St Andrew, along Church Lane is quite pretty.\nEast Preston:\nA few old cottages near the church among the well-to-do suburbia. St Mary the Virgin, C12 with a C19 aisle added by Sir George Gilbert Scott as the population expanded. Actor and comedian Stanley Holloway (1890-1982), famous as Alfred Doolittle in\nMy Fair Lady\n, is buried in the churchyard. Private estates were built between the old centre and the sea as part of Angmering-on-Sea Garden Village. Mostly big thatched cottages built at the end of the Arts and Crafts style, some mock-Tudor houses and a remarkable survival, a garage of 1929 given an up-to the-minute frontage in 1934 in a cool\nmoderne\nstyle. The Shell petrol pumps from the late 1930s/early 1940s remain. Now converted into flats.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe start by heading north from Angmering Station up Station Road to Angmering village centre. Heading east along the High Street ascend Highdown Hill which we'll descend after seeing the fort ramparts and having lunch. After crossing the A259 and railway line we'll briefly head west and southwest through the suburbs of Ferring and cross Ferring Rife to go to Kingston Gorse and the beach. We'll then head east along the beach and turn inland at Sea Road. After detouring to see the garage we'll head north through East then West Preston and go back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this is a near-perfect summer walk for them if it is not too hot: it'll be cool in the trees, even cooler in the sea, and it's not too long. There are some lanes to walk down and busy roads to cross but they can run free on Highdown Hill and Kingston Gorse beach. Dogs are not permitted in Highdown Gardens, so dog owners will have to wait in the tea rooms or bar.\n(Picture credits: Beach Huts, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n;\nLooking Eastwards down Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; The Nineteen Acres, The In Close, Upper West Field by\nSimon Carey\n; Trig point on Highdown Hill by\nRobin Webster\n; Highdown Hill by\nSimon Carey\n; The Miller's Tomb by\nDavid Martin\n; Highdown Hill by C\nhris Thomas-Atkin\n; Looking West from Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; Windmill on the downs above Angmering by\nDavid Martin\n; Post box in the wall by\nSandy B\n; Enjoying the Coastline by\nSandy B\n; Kingston Beach by\nSimon Carey\n; Ferring Rife by\nPeter Webster\n; Maytree Cottage/ Evergreen Cottage, Church Lane/Ferring Street, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n. Images permitted for use under Creative Commons License\nCC BY-SA 2.0\n.

It’s the only place in the world where full size steam engines can be seen passing each other – just as it was when steam ruled the rails.\nWe plan to arrive by 10am, but the steam train does not go until 11:20am, this will give us enough time to look around the museum before getting on the train. We will be able to get a single ticket from the Loughbrough booking office on the day, priced at £10 each at the time of writing.\nWe'll be getting on the steam train in time for its departure at 11.20am sharp (£10 one-way. Buy your ticket at Loughborough station on the day).\nWe’ll travel from Loughborough to Rothley about a 20min ride. The 11.20am train also has the Griddle Car (see food and drink below), which means you could get a late breakfast onboard, if you wish. We will board the train at 11am to give us enough time to order and eat food.\nAfter a jolly good ride on the train, we'll find ourselves in Rothley, where we'll  start the 10mile walk back.\nThe route will take us through Mountsorrell and around Swithland Reservoir, where hopefully we'll see the steam trains in operation from the sidelines (calling all Train Spotters) while heading back towards the Grand Union Canal, for the last leg to bring us back to Loughborough Central Station where we started.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This is one of the events organised as part of\nBig Spring Camp 2025.\nWhat is Touch Rugby?\nEver wanted to be a rugby player but the thought of being tackled kept you from joining in? Then Touch Rugby is for you! Touch Rugby is a minimal contact version of rugby where tackling is replaced by touching the ball carrier. It’s a fun sport that emphasizes skill, strategy and teamwork! A Touch rugby match only lasts about 15mins, 7 mins each half with a minute water break in between.\nWhat to expect?\nFrom 4:30pm on Saturday we will do an hour of training to get ready for the OutdoorLads Big Spring Camp Touch Rugby Tournament. You will learn techniques and skills to help you have fun and beat the competition! Then at 5:45pm we will split into teams and have a tournament to see which team is the winner of the first ever BSC Touch Rugby Tournament!\nDo I need previous experience?\nNo. Touch Rugby is fun and our coach Simon is a fully qualified England Rugby (RFU) coach who has previously coached the Kings Cross Steelers team in the IGR league, he will help you with any questions/skills, so come along and give it a go.\nCan I come along and just watch?\nIf you want to come and cheer on all those taking part, then absolutely, please do! (but don't sign up to this event page if not taking part!)\nWho's running the session?\nSimon Stewart (SCAPS)\nI am a qualified England Rugby (RFU) coach and have previously coached 3XV Kings Cross Steelers in the International Gay Rugby (IGR) League. I am also a new member of OutdoorLads looking forward to many new walks, hikes and camping adventures!\nPlease note: Touch rugby can be quite fast so if you have any respiratory issues remember to bring inhalers, etc, with you.\nPhotos provided by Simon Stewart and are free to use for OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Pease feel free to attend and leave as an when you feel comfortable.\nThere’s a coach that runs an informal training session to teach us a few moves and techniques when it comes to problem solving on the wall.\nIf you’re new to The Climbing Hanger it’s a fantastic indoor bouldering centre with plenty of routes caves, slabs and a monstrous overhangs that will give you the PUMP your arms crave.\nCards/contactless ONLY  - this venue does not accept cash\nIf you haven't been to The Hangar before, please click\nhere\nto pre-register. Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times.

    "Summary": "This is one of the events organised as part of\nBig Spring Camp 2025\n.\nSo, the plan for the day is a fairly technical hike with a fair bit of scrambling.\nFrom wikipedia\n:\n\"\nScrambling\nis a\nmountaineering\nterm for ascending steep terrain using one's hands to assist in holds and balance.\n[1]\nIt can be described as being between\nhiking\nand\nrock climbing\n.\"\nWith this in mind, the day will be best suited for people with experience of climbing or having done some scrambling events before.  A key point is that you'd be steady on your feet and have a good head for heights.\nThe route, depending on weather conditions (if it's raining, we'll unlikely do this route as the conditions under foot cold become a right mess) would be to ascend pretty steeply up to Pen yr Ole Wen straight from Llyn Ogwen.  This is quite a demanding section, and we're straight into it from the get go.  Once up on Pen yr Ole Wen, we've got a few options which could include Carnedd Dafydd, potentially another scramble of Crib Lem and we'd likely get back to the cars via Cwm Lloer.\nSo the crux of it, is that it's likely to be a pretty long day, though we have many options to tailor it once we start off.\nPhotos provided by OutdoorLads members and used with permission\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The initial ascent of Elidir Fawr at 924m is a challenging 800m uphill walk to its summit. The reward is some of the finest views over the Arfon plain towards Anglesey and the surrounding mountain ranges of northern Snowdonia.\nWe will pass Marchlyn Mawr reservoir, which is the upper reservoir for Dinorwig Hydro-Electric power station, a pump storage facility hidden inside the mountain.\nWater from this lake flows through huge tunnels into the lower reservoir Llyn Peris, which is used to generate electricity at times of peak demand.\nThe walk is on marked paths with some scree paths but nothing technical, however this is a challenging walk which requires a good degree of fitness to muster the energy to then conquer Y Garn at 947m.\nHowever, all this effort is worth it for some of the most spectacular views of the neighbouring mountains, before a steep gradual descent back to Nant Peris.\n*Please note this walk has been marked as difficult due to the nature of the mountainous terrain* You will need a good level of fitness ability for this walk.\nIs this your first walk event with Outdoorlads?

All topped off with an award winning ice cream at the end.\nStarting off in\nBeddgelert\n, a charming Snowdonia village at the confluence of two rivers to form the River Glaslyn and home of the legend of Prince Llewelyn’s dog, Gelert. After parking in the main car park, we will walk through to the riverside and past\nGelert’s grave\n. Then crossing the Welsh Highland Railway track, proceed riverside through the\nAberglaslyn Pass\nalong the narrow but picturesque\nFisherman’s Walk\nto Pont Aberglaslyn. Following the path through the\nNantmor forest\nand the ascent out into\nCwm Bychan\n, navigating the abandoned mechanical remains of the\n17th Century copper mine\nfacilities. At the summit of the Cwm, we will descend down to the lake\nLlyn Dinas\n, the site of an Arthurian mythological battle; walking along its banks to start a second ascent, weather and time dependent, partly via the\nWatkin Path,\nstopping at the ancient ruins of\nDinas Emrys\ncastle, a relic of Iron Age history and Arthurian legend that was said to be built upon a giant dragon's tomb. We will then cross\nMerlin's Pool\n& waterfall before following the River Gwynant past the\nSygun Copper Mine\nback to Beddgelert for some refreshments and amazing ice cream can be found (highly recommend the strawberry cheesecake flavour!)\nThis event is a circular walk, meeting at the BSC campsite first at 8.30am before driving to the nearby village of Beddgelert; carpooling available. It will be a full day so you’ll need a packed lunch, some snacks and plenty of fluid to drink. Walking boots are essential, as the ground is rough in places and may be wet and muddy, depending on the weather.\nNote that this is not a stroll in the park: it’s a serious 18km walk with 2 ascents as we climb through the Cwm Bychan valley (ascent is approx 400 meters) - you will need a decent level of fitness. On the day, I may need to shorten the hike if the weather is not ideal, but it will still be a great trip.\nApprox Itinerary\n8.30 - meet at BSC assembly point, leave for Beddgelert 8.40.\n9:15 - arrive at Beddgelert.\n13:30 - stop for lunch.\n15:00/16:00 - Arrival back at Beddgelert for ice cream, maybe a beer/beverage, then back to camp\nYour First OutdoorLads Walk Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the My First Event page on the OutdoorLads website.

We can begin through a forest, or we could take a direct path straight up via deserted quarry buildings. Either way, we will ultimately find ourselves at the foot of an\nimpressive ridge\nwhich offers walking or scrambling (where you need to use your hands) to the summit. Don't let the idea of\nscrambling\nput you off - this is a great place to try it for the first time as a few steps to the left will immediately find yourself back on two feet! that said, if it is wet or icy we will, of course, take the safer, walking option.\nFrom the summit (where, if the weather is kind, the views are truly superb) we will descend the gentle slope toward Plas y Brenin.\n***All photos taken by Mark House and used with permission***\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Run alongside the venue's Special LGBTQ+ event - Join us for an evenings bouldering at Liverpool's premier Bouldering Wall @ their Sandhills venue.\nThe centre do a Meet + Great session for the group at 6:30pm (with a free cuppa!) so feel free to come along for that, or if you'd prefer to just come for climbing, that will start at around 7pm with a warm up. (*please note event leader may not arrive in time for the meet & greet at 6:30, but will be definitely be there by 7). The Tues-Gay climbing ends around 9, but the centre is open till 10pm if you have the energy to do a bit more! Any questions, please message the event leader.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' as they are referred to tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the 'hassle' of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and any member is welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nTo come along and join in with us, you will need to register via the event page, and to climb you will need to pay the usual entry fee directly to the centre (pay this on arrival at the centre). You don't have to pay anything to OutdoorLads for this event- just register for free. I will meet any new faces at the till to help get you checked in.\nPlease complete your registration on The Hangar's website (\nclick here\n) before your visit\nif this is your first time\n(this will save you having to do this on their tablets in centre, which will save you time when you arrive. Its also necessary to pre-book your climb currently (entrance is still limited due to Covid, so best to pre-book to avoid disappointment if full on arrival.\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the North West -\nClick here\nto see all the current events.

Originally composed to accompany a ballet of the same name, this musical series depicts various weather formations throughout the four seasons.\nAn epic finale to SSO’s 2024/2025 repertoire, the orchestra will be performing the magnificent Planets Suite by Holst, featuring some themes you will probably recognise. The most recognisable is arguably ‘Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity’ though keen ears will spot some of the other Planet themes too - both John Williams and Howard Shore took influence from the suite when composing music for ‘Star Wars’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’ respectively.\nTickets can be purchased online\non the SSO website\nan will also be available on the door. The cost is £12'.50.

We are close to the famous Sgwd Yr Eira waterfalls.\nOutside the bunkhouse there is a circular area with large fire pit and eating area (weather permitting) from where there are beautiful views of the Brecon Beacons. There's also a small stone built roofed building seating 6 people with a log burner. So we will have plenty of space both inside and out.\nOn Sunday we need to check out of the bunkhouse by 11am, but there may be the option to then head out for a Sunday walk and /or a pub lunch.\nDuties\nThe event is run by ODL volunteers who will need all participants to share in our domestic duties: food preparation, table setting and clearing, emptying bins, dishwashing, ongoing tidying of our space, cleaning of our dorms and bathrooms before departure.\nBedding\nBedding is provided for you, but don't forget to bring a towel.\nFriday Evening\n: Arrive anytime after 4pm, meet the rest of the group and socialise.

    "Summary": "An evening walk along the old Balerno railway\nLong before the phrase Active Travel entered government lexicon Lothian Regional Council started buying old railway trackbeds from British Rail, as BR went about removing the railway network in the 70s and 80s that had existed across the north of Edinburgh. This foresightedness has left a legacy of a network of popular paths crossing the city.\nThis linear walk follows the Balerno loop from Currie into Edinburgh. We start from Curriehill station and drop down through Currie to cross the Water of Leith and pick up the old railway line just east of the former station location. Apart from a small detour where the city bypass crosses the route and has changed the landscape, we are on a surfaced route of the railway which is largely on a downhill gradient until it reaches the existing railway between Kingsknowe and Slateford. The remainder of the walk into the west end of Edinburgh is on the Union Canal towpath to Lochrin Basin.\nPhotos :\nTaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event will open for bookings on Friday 16th May. We are trialling delayed booking for all day walks in the Northeast and Yorkshire Region to reduce waiting lists and late cancellations. We know that a significant number of members who book places on our walks eventually decide not to attend the event. This causes long waiting lists and makes it harder for those who wish to attend an event to obtain a place. If you are interested in attending this event, please click the ‘bookmark’ button to add this page to your list of bookmarked events. This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nExplore the beauty of the Bradford district and celebrate\nBradford 2025 – UK City of Culture\nwith a circular walk through the village of Haworth, Brontë country. Take in the wild wilderness and the spectacular views from the moorlands, following in the steps of the Brontë sisters.\nWe begin in Haworth, taking in the heritage railway, and the cobbled streets with quaint shops and tea rooms. A short walk out of the village and we'll pass a reservoir before tracing the moorland path to the Brontë bridge and waterfall.\nNext, we'll climb around 150m onto Withens Flat, passing by\nTop Withens\nan old, ruined farmhouse which is said to have helped inspire Wuthering Heights (it's not the house featured in the book though as you'll see on the walk). We'll hopefully have lunch up here (weather permitting) so you can experience the landscape in all its rugged beauty.\nFinally, we'll cross the moorland into Penistone Hill Country Park and back into Haworth. It tends to be a bit boggy up on the moorland even without rain.\nThere’ll be an optional trip to a café at the end of the walk, and you're free to explore the quirkiness of the village.\nThis event is timed to ensure those planning on\nattending the Leeds Summer social\ncan get there for the evening.\nDogs:\nWell-behaved, socialised and under-control dogs are welcome on this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted and whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. If it's hot, you'll need to make sure you're carrying sufficient extra water. If you're unsure, contact the leader for guidance.\nIf the event is fully booked:\nPlease\njoin the wait list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads walk event:\nIf this is your first event, we’ll make sure you feel welcomed.

It's a beautiful area and over the weekend we can do some great hikes, relax and have a few beers around the campfire.\nOur venue for the weekend is a little village not far from the pretty town of Dartmouth, with miles of the stunning South West Coast Path stretching out in either direction. It's a perfect spot for hiking, chilling, and exploring.\nOn Saturday and Sunday we'll probably hike along the coast. Expect plenty of up and downs but also some spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way, with wooded valleys, rocky coves and stunning beaches including Slapton Sands and Blackpool Sands.\nThe spacious campsite was once used as an airfield by American marines to practice for the D-Day landings. Sadly the marines have long gone, but the campsite is in a great spot and we'll have our own field just for us! There's toilets, hot showers (20p for 5 mins), a small kitchen (with fridge) and washing up sinks. Camp fires and BBQs are allowed providing they are off the ground.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on the campsite but will need to be on a lead. Dogs are £1 a night, payable directly to the site on arrival. Well behaved OutdoorLads too please...this isn’t a party event and we'll need to be quiet after 11pm (the owners are super strict about this).\nThere's a couple of pubs a short stroll away and Slapton Sands beach is a further ten minutes down the road.  There’s a clothing optional beach too, if that’s your thing.\nPhotos:\nAll photos from OutdoorLads Members and permission is given for use by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at The Climbing Hanger in Sheffield.\nCards/contactless ONLY  - this venue does not accept cash\nIf you haven't been to The Hangar before, please click\nhere\nto pre-register. Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

    "Summary": "What is the SE500 Challenge?\nThe SE500 is a proposed series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 meters of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement? Along the way, see some of the South East’s most beautiful countryside, dramatic hills and natural panoramas along the way. Look out for more of these walks around the South East over the coming months.\nThis route definitely plays into the ascent and decent aspect of the challenge, with two thirds of the route either ascending or descending the Watlington SE500 is up there when it comes to calorie burning!\nWe start the walk in the charming town of Watlington which is nestled in the scenic Chiltern Hills. The town boasts a history dating back to the 6th century, with medieval streets and historic buildings creating a unique atmosphere. Watlington Hill is a popular spot for nature enthusiasts, offering stunning views and ideal walking paths. The town has a growing reputation as a creative centre with a lively community of artists and musicians, hosting a range of annual events celebrating the arts, music, TV, and film, including Midsomer Murders, Inspector Morse, Poirot, Great Expectations, Sherlock Holmes, Philomena, and many more. Watlington is one of the few remaining market towns to have its own award-winning butchers, artisan chocolatiers, fresh fruit and vegetable market, florists, and boutique shops. This walk offers beautiful views and a variety of landscapes, including woodlands and open fields. The area is rich in history and natural beauty.\nThe\nroute\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome on this walk, there will be livestock on route.

Little ringed plovers, avocets and oystercatchers sometimes breed, while in winter the lagoons are home to pintails, wigeons, goldeneyes, snipe and shovelers. Rarer visitors include bitterns.\nThere will be ample opportunity on this walk to stop and view birdlife etc from the various hides on the site. The walk will not be wholly on the reserve but include field paths and tracks in the countryside surrounding the reserve, where you can enjoy the redkites as they glide majestically across the skies.\nAfter the walk there's an option to enjoy tea and cake at the Yolk Farm cafe before your journey home.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this event.

    "Summary": "Welcome to 2025!\nOur monthly London pub socials are the perfect gateway to Outdoor Lads and our busy diary of brilliant events!\nTypically our socials have a rich mix of regulars, occasionals, and newbies, not only from London and the South East, but dropping in from across the country.\nWe will have space to ourselves in this friendly venue, and you'll be very welcome to indulge in a soft drink even though we are meeting in a bar!\nWhether it's hiking, camping, cycling, climbing, or a range of other activities - we do it!  Outdoors is our focus, but our socials are the chance to catch up with lads you've already met, find out about the group, and meet new members and event leaders.\nLook forward to seeing you!\nIs this your first ODL event?\nIf you have never been to one of our events before, attending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like. Check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nFollow my ODL London Social Events on\nTelegram\n---\nFeedback from our London Social:\n\"it was my first ever event and I was super nervous walking in, but I was really welcomed, and ended up having a good evening, the guys were great. I heard about the ODL activities, I'm in!\"\n\"I don't live in London, but was down for work that day, so I came along. Brilliant to catch up with some of the lads I haven't seen in a long while\"\nPhotos:\nProvided by the leader and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Come join OutdoorLads for indoor climbing in North London!\nAt the biggest climbing centre in North London, there are 450 routes over 95 lines set across 1000 square metres of wall offering top-roping, lead climbing and bouldering on a wide range of slabs, cracks, overhangs, off-widths and chimneys - there really is something to suit every level of climbing ability!\nI've never climbed before, can I come along? YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

    "Summary": "Change of date due to clash with London Pride - this event was 5th July, now 19th July.\nAt just over 14 miles, this day of walking is more challenging than your average walk. But you are rewarded with a lot of forest and a sense of being away from it all.\nWe'll start near the River Deben, and pass through beautiful Suffolk countryside before heading into the woods. Miles of pine forest await, as we make our way around the perimeter of an old airbase. We'll stop for lunch in a Forestry England car park where a refreshment van serves drinks and snacks for those who need them. We'll then continue our journey out of the forest, passing Gobblecock Cottage, where the forest opens up to acres of beautiful farmland.\nAs we near the end of the walk we will arrive at Sutton Hoo, the famous site of Anglo-Saxon burial mounds. We will have time to go up the viewing platform to take in the full view (all for free) but we will skip the visitor centre. We will then finish off with a final woodland walk back to where we began.\nThe day promises to deliver lovely settings, great company and tired legs! There may be an opportunity for a drink at the end of the walk for those who want to.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but they'll need to be fit and able to cope with 14 miles in their stride. Please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n).  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nDon't waste that space\nBear in mind that both new and existing members are excited to be getting out more. So please only book if you know you can make it. Please note the relatively early start time and reasonably remote location too. Should your plans change, please free up the space immediately for someone else who could attend.

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.",

This walk is also one of a pair of walks this weekend in the vicinity of Porthmadog. The other one can be seen here\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/railway-ramble-blaenau-ffestiniog-tan-y-bwlch-250503\n.\nIf you are making a weekend of it there are hotel options in Porthmadog including a new Premier Inn, and for camping There's the\nShell Island Camp\ntaking place that weekend or contact the leader for advice.\nOn this coastal walk we will follow the Wales Coast Path all the way from the historic port town of Portmadog, where thousands of tons of slate were once exported, to the Victorian seaside resort of Criccieth Famous for its ruined thirteenth-century castle standing proudly on a rocky headland.\nOur return journey will be aboard the Scenic Cambrian Coast line and\ncosts £3.80 pp\n.\nWe start our walk in the town of\nPorthmadog\n: Nowadays a bustling town catering for Welsh speaking locals as well as tourism, with the well known Portmerion gardens and Italianate estate nearby. There are no less than 4 railway lines serving the town - the Cambrian coast line is the 'main line' that connects the terminus of Pwlhelli with places as far afield as Birmingham, The Welsh Highland Heritage line - a little branch line with ocassionals services, The Welsh Highland Line - created in the 1980's the narrow gauge steams all the way to Caernarfon through the heart of Eryri National Park, and The Ffestiniog Railway, that carried so much slate down from the mountains. You'll see all of these as we begin our route. We will also see the famous barrage or Cobb that was built to take the steam trains across the Glaslyn Estuary. Keep an eye open for the Ospreys that spend summer nearby.... We then follow the shallow harbour that is home to yachts these days and take a footpath and back road out of town .\nThe next place we encounter is\nBoth Y Guest\n, a sleepy little beach resort with a small harbour and some very scenic coves looking back towards the mountains.\nContinuing along the beach we come to\nBlack Rock Sands\nwhich is one of the few places in the UK where you can actually drive cars onto the beach (If you don't mind getting it wet and sandy). If the tide is too high we might need to deviate inland around the rock, but otherwise it is around the corner that we will catch sight of\nCriccieth\nand its castle. The Castle was both built and destroyed by Welsh princes 200 years apart, so now its just a ruin. Depending on the speed of the group there are options at Criccieth for sea swimming (bring trunks), visiting the castle, the famous Cadwalladers Ice cream shop, Tea and Cakes or a pint in a pub. If its tight on time then we will wait till we are back in Porthmadog for tea.\nAll photos:\nAndyM, event leader.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved  and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.  Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Dogs are accepted on the train.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help, also please be sure to fill in the participation statement.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The other walk can be seen and boooked here\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/railway-ramble-porthmadog-criccieth-250504\nIf you are making a weekend of it there are hotel options in Porthmadog including a new Premier Inn, and for camping There's the\nShell Island Camp\ntaking place that weekend or contact the leader for advice.\nOn this walk we will use the service of the famous Ffestiniog Narrow Gauge Railway to return to the start. Our walk zig- zags down the valley and crosses the track 5 times. It begins in the 'Town that roofed the World' as it is known, Bleanau Ffestiniog and initially passes rows of terraced miners cottages so typical of the area,  We will then have some height gain to do as we rise up to the flank of the Stwlan Dam on the Moelyn Mountains and gain a commanding view. Back down at the railway line our next place of interest is the spiral track at Dduallt - the only one of it's kind in the UK. we continue down passing waterfalls in the Meantwrog Nature reserve to our destination at Tan Y Blwch. A steam powered train will haul us back up to the start.\nTHE FARE WILL BE £10pp, payable on the train please bring cash to make life easy.\nThe Festiniog Railway:\nis the world’s oldest narrow gauge railway with almost 200 years of history. Originally a gravity railway taking slate down to the port of Porthmadog for export, the historic and unique steam trains climb over 700 feet from sea level into the mountains through tranquil pastures and magnificent forests, past lakes and waterfalls, clinging to the side of the mountain. The Ffestiniog Railway and it’s infrastructure are now an integral part of the UNESCO “Slate landscape of North Wales” World Heritage Site.\nAll photos:\nAndyM, event leader.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but please note this walk sometimes passes reas of livestock so your dog needs to be well behaved and on a lead, and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.  Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Dogs are accepted on the train.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help, also please be sure to fill in the participation statement.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Tucked between the hills, this narrow glen is a hidden gem filled with mossy boulders, tumbling waterfalls, and the unmistakable sound of water making its way downhill—often faster than you are.\nHalfway into the glen, keep an eye out for\nJohn Knox’s Pulpit\n, a craggy sandstone outcrop where the reformer is said to have preached in secret. Whether it’s history or Highland myth, it adds a dose of drama to the already magical surroundings.\nFrom Glen Vale, the trail takes a turn skyward, leading you on a steady 200m climb to the summit of\nBishop Hill\n. At 461m, the top offers big-sky views over\nLoch Leven\n, the patchwork of reservoirs below, and—on a clear day—stretching all the way to the\nFirth of Forth\n. It’s a great spot to stop, snack, and admire the world from a bishop-approved altitude.\nThe descent is kind to the knees, winding gently back down grassy slopes and open moorland, eventually rejoining the quiet reservoir track that loops you back to where you started.\nExpect a good variety of scenery: leafy woodland, airy hilltops, and the calming presence of water almost throughout. With a bit of history, a few climbs, and a healthy helping of scenic drama, this route is ideal for walkers looking to earn their picnic—and maybe a story or two to tell with it.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but please note and abide by the\nScottish Outdoor Access Code\n.  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nPhotos :\nTaken by event leader Marvin16\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "We’ll make our way through shaded woodland walks (the trees will be in leaf!), alongside rivers to open moorland.\nStarting in Yelverton I’ll take you south, briefly picking up the route of the old Plymouth/Dartmoor tramway, before heading into the Meavy valley. Continuing mainly through woodland alongside the disused Plymouth/Tavistock GWR railway downstream to Hoo Meavy, passing old copper mines, signs of charcoaling platforms and long abandoned head weirs for leats to provide water power to distant mines.\nFrom Lower Goodameavy we’ll ascend an outstanding example of an inclined plane (what’s left of it), pass the disused Dewerstone granite quarries, located in lovely temperate rainforest, before continuing to rise out of the woodland to summit Dewerstone Rock itself.\nAn open moor walk of a mile or so, offering views of the south west Dartmoor tors and no doubt an encounter with some of the Dartmoor ponies, brings us to Cadover Bridge. Lunch (maybe a paddle in the river) before we set off again following the River Plym back through woodland along the line of the old china clay slurry pipeline from Lee Moor. Passing the old workings of the Shaugh Prior clay drying kilns, we’ll drop down to the confluence of the rivers where there is yet more industrial heritage.\nA short upward walk along a back-road brings us out onto the open moorland of Roborough Common with views back to the Dewerstone and across the local farmland. Now a relatively level walk across the Common brings us to Drake’s Leat and thence (perhaps after an optional call into the Skylark Inn at Clearbrook) to the Dartmoor/Plymouth tramway. From there a flat walk takes us back to Yelverton.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nPlease also be aware of the\nrules and guidance from the Dartmoor National Park Authority\non visiting the moor with your dog\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Date": "Saturday Jul 19 2025",

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "40",
    "Summary": "When I checked out the area on a cold, bleak day in February, Chilling lived up to its name. When we stroll round the area on a lazy, hazy day in July, 'Chilling' will suggest relaxation. The only settlemen is Titchfield, far from bleak, which grew in prosperity in Georgian times as that of its Abbey dwindled, leaving the Earl of Southampton's ex-monastic mansion to be plundered for its stone. And on matters geological, the landscape is formed of Ice Age gravel outwash overlying sand, and this makes for a flat terrain which the sea and River Meon have quickly eroded. The Meon's mouth is a tiny, pretty harbour with a café, an ice cream van and a beach where we can have our lunch and a swim.\nThe sights:\nTitchfield Abbey:\nFounded in 1232 by Prémontré Abbey in France, the 'White Canons' lived a communal life observing monastic vows, farming the land, caring for the sick and preaching. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537, Henry VIII granted the abbey to his Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. The wealth of his new domain aided Wriothesley's ascent as a courtier, and he transformed the abbey into a handsome home. Wriothesley’s grandson Henry, 3rd Earl of Southampton, was a patron of Shakespeare, some of whose plays were premiered here. On the death of the 4th Earl, the abbey passed through several families, until 1781, when most of the building was demolished for building stone, leaving the gatehouse intact. It is free to enter. Nearby is Titchfield Great Barn, 48m long, in which the timbers have been dated to 1370.\nSt Peter's Church, Titchfield:\nEstablished 680, making it one of the oldest used churches in England. Though only a few parts of the original structure survive, the church contains a mixture of building styles. There is a sumptuous tomb to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, his son Henry, and grandson Henry, the patron of Shakespeare.\nTitchfield:\nLong a centre for business, with the town once having a small port. There were also tanneries, a market (in a fine market square), a fair, breweries, and craft workshops. A market hall was built in the Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early C17, but in 1970 it was bought, in a derelict state, by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. Titchfield is quite a gracious place.\nChilling and Brownwich Cliffs:\nPleistocene deposits (2.5 to 1 million years old) of gravel washed out from glaciers to the north overlies Eocene (50-40 million years old) sands and clays giving a flat relief to the area. These are unconsolidated rocks, easily eroded by the sea and rivers. The profile of the cliffs with gravel atop sand is obvious, with some disturbance of the gravel by ice wedges developing under periglacial conditions, a process called cryoturbation. Some erratics (rocks deposited by melting ice bergs) dot the beach, which are sarsen stones composed of sandstone, probably from Salisbury Plain.\nTitchfield Haven:\nThe estuary of the River Meon. The 'Visit Hampshire' website states: 'Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve is a wetland nature reserve with a rich habitat of rivers, marshlands and scrapes. It is excellent for birdwatching and attracts many people hoping to spot a rare species. From any of the eight easy-to-access viewing hides visitors can see all kinds of wildlife such as deer, foxes and wetland plants.' We will walk around the edge of the reserve, not entering it as a fee is charged, and still see many of these habitats. There is a shop, café and exhibition centre and nearby a small beach. The mouth of the Meon is controlled by lock gates and a small, pretty harbour has been created.\nTitchfield Canal:\nPossibly the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611. Close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. It was used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated although for a while Titchfield was a small inland port.\nSeawater quality:\nThe most recent bathing water quality at the bathing location was rated 'Excellent'. The water quality has always been deemed 'Good' or 'Excellent', but check\nhere\n(Environment Agency) or\nhere\n(Surfers Against Sewage).\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. Dogs are permitted on Hill Head Beach which is where we'll have lunch and a swim. Drawbacks of the walk for dogs include some roads to walk along and cross which may be busy, and summer heat which could be exhausting for them. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll go north up Mill Lane to see the abbey, then head back, using a footpath behind the recreation ground and crossing the A27 to enter Titchfield by an alleyway. We'll walk through the centre of Titchfield to Bellfield, then walk south along the canal to Great Posbrook Farm, where we'll go west along footpaths to Brownwich Lane, which will take us north to Warsash Road.

    "Title": "SE500 Challenge: Satanic Scenery - A Devilishly Fine Walk from Jumps to Punch Bowl",
    "Date": "Saturday Jun 21 2025",

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "35",
    "Summary": "And a quite diabolically demanding one too. This event covers two set-pieces of southwest Surrey scenery, both ascribed to Beelzebub because of their bizarre beauty: the huge wooded amphitheatre that is the Devil's Punch Bowl at Hindhead and the isolated outcrops of sandstone that are the Devil's Jumps at Churt. Surrey heathland and high-class suburbia connect the two. One extra highlight will be the decidedly un-dark, un-Satanic Barford Mill. The infernal inheritance of our Luciferan labours will be vast views, prodigious pride, cracking camaraderie and heightened health and happiness, and all gained without any pacts with the Prince of Darkness. Consult the forbidden lore below.\nSelections from the grimoire:\nBarford Mill:\nA pretty little mill on the stream that drains down Whitmoor Vale to Frensham Great Pond.\nThe Devil's Jumps:\nThree small hills, more prominent than their heights (around 120m) suggest, topped by crags of hard ironstone (sandstone). William Cobbett wrote about the Devil's Jumps in his\nRural Rides\n, first published in 1830, \"At Churt...three hills out upon the common, called the Devil's Jumps...in the shape of three rather squat sugar-loaves, along in a line upon this heath...with a rock-stone upon the top of one of them as big as a church tower.\" Back in the Jurassic Period, when layers of iron-rich greensand were laid down on a river delta, periodic floodwaters disturbed the beds, contorting them. As a result, the Jumps look to me like the ends of giant Cadbury's Flakes jutting from the ground. It was said that Mother Ludlam of Farnham (who was a witch) had her cauldron stolen by the Devil, who kicked up the hills as he made off with it.\nThe Devil's Punch Bowl and Hindhead Commons:\nThis is a large hollow of sandy heath, fringed with oak woodland and thronged with birdlife including redstart and wood warbler. Legend has it that the Devil tormented the god Thor by pelting him with enormous handfuls of earth, leaving the great ravine. In reality it was created by glacial meltwater percolating down through the sandstone until it hit an impervious layer of clay and so eroded the sandstone out. See more\nhere\n.\nWhat the Devil is SE500?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average Lowland and Hill Walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nHounds of Hell:\nThere'll be none of these on the walk, as dogs will be welcomed who are obedient and tolerant of walking along lanes and on leads when livestock are present. The walk could be exhausting for them in hot weather. Otherwise, it will be a great dog walk with abundant woodland and heathland for them to roam in.\nRoute 666\n(please click the\nlink\nto see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll follow Wey Hill west until Farnham Lane and The Avenue heading northwest to Lion Lane, where we'll leave the tarmac and cross Polecat, Craig's Wood and Nutcombe Down before using the footbridge over the A3 to Grayshott. A path along the edge of Whitmore Vale will take us to Beacon Hill and and Whitmore Vale Lane will take us to Barford Mill all the time heading northwest. At Kitts Lane, we'll turn east and follow Green Lane to Hale House Lane, then a track north to Jumps Road. After lunch on the jump and a drink at Bel and the Dragon, we'll follow Tilford Road south to Hyde Lane where a footpath will then take us from Hyde Hill to the Devil's Punch Bowl. At Coombe Head we'll go on to cross Bunch Lane down to Farnham Lane where we'll retrace our steps back to the station.\n(Image credits: The Devil's Punch Bowl, from the viewpoint: Photo ©\nMr James D\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Stony Jump, Surrey, England: Photo ©\nweesam2010 | Flickr\n(\ncc-by-nc-sa/2.0\n); Polecat Copse: Photo ©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Coniferous woodland: Photo ©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Whitmore Vale, Pondside: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bell & The Dragon, Churt: early July 2024: Photo ©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Rocky terrain atop the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View south east from the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Grazing by Highcomb Copse: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Sun and Shade at the Devil's Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Looking down on the Devil’s Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

For those arriving by car - there is plenty of free street car parking - suggest to spread out a little into nearby streets as well for courtesy to neighbours.\nThe closest train station to the meeting point is Eastleigh - about 1.3 miles away.\n**** Closer in time I will check with the Ship Inn - to see about accommodating numbers, in case of increased demand for joining this walk ****\nI've not yet done a recce, but I would estimate that the circular route will be 12-13 miles. There will be some moderate climbs.\nHeading from\nBishopstoke\n, a suburb of Eastleigh, we will cross into\nStoke Park Wood\n(part of the Ancient Forest of Bere) which was a private deer hunting ground for King Henry VIII.\nFrom here we head east to, and cross, the Portsmouth Road (B2177) where Red Lane and Hatchley Lane will take us north past Deeps Copse, Sladford's Copse, before turning left into Laybushes Copse and Austin Copse where a forest trail leads us to Owslebury.\nAtop a hill,\nOwslebury\nis on the Pilgrim's Trail from Winchester to Mont St Michel and the Monarch's Way. This leafy area during the 1830s was the scene of the Swing Riots. Across Southern England agricultural workers formed mobs and threatened to damaged machinery and property demanding money. One of the local Owlesbury farmers John Boyes took sympathy for the workers, he accompanied the mob and wrote a letter petitioning landowners to increase pay. He was tried and sentenced to transportation in Van Diemens Land (Tasmania), but he was later pardoned and returned to his farm.\nFrom Owslebury we will head south towards Colden Common, before walking through the enchanting\nUpperbarn Copse\n, back to Stoke Park Wood and our meeting point at Bishopstoke.\nDogs are welcome, but please have them under control. At some points the path is quite narrow and you may need to step aside should anyone else be passing. Be prepared you may need to call you dog to heel on occasion. From what I can see on the Ship Inn webpage it is a dog friendly pub  but please do feel free to check yourselves.\nPhotographs\nThese images are my own taken whilst doing a route recce on 12 April 25.

    "Summary": "**Please note change of date from 18 May\n**\nJoin me on this spectacular circular walk from Lewes around the South Downs. After a steepish climb near the start, the walk offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and beyond.\nWhen I led this walk in 2023, it was a very hot day, and the majority of us ran out of water. Fortunately we found a water tap in a local church yard. Hopefully it will be cooler this time, but do remember your water!\nWhat is SE500 Challenge?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nPlaces\nof interest\nLewes\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nSouth\nDowns\nNational\nPark\nThis is England's newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010, covering an area of 1,627 square kilometres (628 sq miles) and stretches for 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.\nOffham\nPronounced \"Oaf-um\", the \"new\" St. Peter's Church was built to replace the Church of Old St. Peter in 1840s. Offham hosts two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Clayton to Offham Escarpment and Offham Marshes.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\nWe leave delightful Lewes and pass over the railway line and A27 to pick up Jugg's Road (track) which we follow past the windmill at Kingston Hollow. With a steepish climb of 197m, we're graced with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the South Downs. After passing under the railway and over the A27 again, we climb Long Hill, where we'll stop for lunch, enjoying views of the surrounding countryside. We'll continue over Balmer Down and along the South Downs Way, before starting our gradual descent to the village of Offham. The walk then follows the River Ouse, and the outskirts of Lewes, climbing towards the castle before descending past The Fifteenth Century Bookshop and the quaint houses along Keere Street, and back to the station.\nPlease join me if you wish, for a drink at The Depot, next to the station.\nPlease note, the walk does not allow time to visit Lewes Castle.\nDogs\n:\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and be prepared for a couple of stiles/hills on the walk.

    "Summary": "Join us for a weekend camping at Nantcol Waterfalls, nestled at the foot of the Rhinog mountains.\nFar less well known than the areas in the north of the\nEryri National Park\n, the Rhinogydd are a wild range of hills in central Snowdonia that are rougher than anything else south of Scotland.The Rhinog mountains are popular with hillwalkers looking for a more isolated, wilder walking experience and we plan to put on a strenuous walk to explore these hills properly.\nIf mountains aren't for you, Cwm Nantcol has beautiful woods and spectacular waterfalls to explore, and we're also not far from the beach.\nShowers -\nthe showers operate on a shower card system which allows a 5-minute shower per card. These cards will be issued to campers at Reception.\nCampfires\n- Nantcol Waterfalls allow campfires but the site is within a Tree Preservation Area and as such we can only allow the burning of manufactured logs – the collection of deadwood and live wood is not permitted. Fires require the use of Fire Baskets only, which can be bought on site or hired from Reception. We will sort a communal fire.\nMobile signal\n- signal is weak at this site but, if you're desperate to get online, you can pay for wifi access. Alternatively, if you venture 100 metres up the hill on the same side as the waterfalls you should obtain 4 bars from most signal providers.\nDogs\n- the site permits dogs with well behaved owners. There is a charge of £4 per dog for the weekend payable on arrival to the site in cash. Dogs must be on a lead at all times when on site as this is a sheep farm - no exceptions can be made.\nMusic\n- This campsite does not allow music to be played.\nSummit area of Aran Fawddwy and view to Rhinog range\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nAndrew Hill\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/5752120\nRhinog Fawr Trig\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nRude Health\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/3358007\nRhinog Fawr\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nJohn Lucas\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4118611\nRemaining images courtesy of Bryan Cosgrove and of Nantcol Waterfalls Campsite\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Walk around the top end of the lake and the wildlife is plentiful. You'll likely see goosander, tufted ducks, graylag, and mute swans at the mill end.\nAfter this we head for the village of Wellow which boasts one of the tallest maypoles in the United Kingdom, towering an impressive 60 feet (20m)! Today, on the Spring Bank Holiday, the village will be alive with celebrations.\nWe continue out of the village past Wellow Dam, a man made pond used for fishing, which is said to have been created by the monks from Rufford Abbey. The village of Wellow is also unusual as it has over 40 acres of common land, second only to Southwell in Nottinghamshire as the largest acreage of common land north of Watford. Wonderful woodland is where we'll find Cocking Moor Wood.\nOn route back to Rufford we pass the circular earthworks around Jordan Castle Farm, once the site of a moated Norman Castle; it is believed the castle was once owned by a knight called Sir Richard Foliot, whose characteristics bore great resemblance to Robin Hood's ally, Sir Richard of the Lee, who was mentioned in many ballads and ledendary tales.\nFinally, we return to the splendid site of the once Cistercian abbey, Rufford Abbey.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a 9-mile / 15 kilometre walk on the South West Coast Path, around the Isle of Portland!\nThis circular walk begins near the Olympic Rings and circumnavigates the island in an anti-clockwise direction. The route mostly follows the official South West Coast Path.  Ascent is around 340 metres, resulting from ups and downs along the way, and with a gradual rise from Portland Bill back to the Olympic Rings.\nHighlights of the walk include:\nOutstanding views from the top of West Cliff of\nChesil Beach\nand\nFleet Lagoon\n, which is the largest tidal lagoon in Britain.\nThe extensive fortification of the\nVerne Citadel\nwhich was built in the 19th century overlooking Portland Harbour, which it was built to defend.  If you’re interested in military architecture, there’s more info\nhere\n.\nThe “\npirate graveyard\n” at the ruined old church of Saint Andrew, so-called because of the skull-and-crossbones design which can be seen on a number of tombstones.\nPulpit Rock\nand\nPortland Bill\nat the southernmost tip of the island, from where spectacular views extend to Start Point in Devon and to Durlston Head in the east.  On a clear day, you can probably see more of the English south coast than from anywhere else.\nPortland Bill Lighthouse\n, which was built by Trinity House in 1906 to guide vessels heading for Portland and Weymouth and acts as a waymark for ships navigating the English Channel.  If you’re interested in lighthouses, there's more info\nhere\n.\nNear the end of the walk, the sculpture park at\nTout Quarry\nis a showcase of modern sculptures created in an old quarry. There’s more info\nhere\n.\nWe may meet other OutdoorLads along the way who are climbing on the Portland cliffs this weekend, if so we'll stop for a chat and maybe watch them climbing for a short while.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs are welcome on the walk, but must be under close control at all times and on a lead in the vicinity of livestock or where wildlife may be disturbed.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to join us, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the event date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "While most of us in ODL are probably perfectly happy experiencing the vibrancy, opportunity and anonymity of the city, some might yearn for the calmness, spaciousness and neighbourliness of a village. If you come on this event, you'll sample the latter for one idyllic summer afternoon.\nIan Nairn, writing in\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n, briefly describes Grayswood as: \" A trim, triangular green, largely Victorian, in picturesque hilly country near the Sussex border.\" The National Open Gardens website additionally invites us to \"Visit Grayswood's gorgeous gardens - all very different, [from] informal cottage style, [to] larger more formal and varied village gardens. Visitors will have an illustrated garden trail to follow through the village [and] there will be homemade cakes and tea at the Village Hall.\" There is also a modest display of classic cars at Grayswood garage, and a plant sale.\nThere will be no set plan for visiting the 10 or so gardens and we won't go round in a big group: you're welcome to go wherever and with whomever you choose. You're also welcome to leave earlier or later, but there will be an agreed meeting place and time should you wish to depart as part of a group, perhaps to catch a particular train. In fact, you don't even need to book on this event to see the gardens of course; we'll just happily bump into you in the village! If you do come by train (or car but want a little more exercise), Haslemere Railway Station is a hour's walk from the village, so we'll have a pleasant walk through the swish suburbs and rough heaths while viewing Hindhead Common to get there. (Please see the route\nhere\n.)\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is somewhat suitable for them. I have asked the organiser and most gardens admit them on leads. They'll enjoy the walk to the village along lanes and through woodlands.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIf all you know of Micheldever is the railway station stranded miles from anywhere, then boy are you in for a surprise if you come on this relatively easy little walk. Once we've covered a few miles of undulating arable fields we'll reach the River Dever and the sequestered stretch of idyllic little villages, fine manor houses, ancient remote churches and vintage watercress beds that it trickles through. This is where the chief interest of the walk will lie: watching the trout skulking beneath the sparkling surface, gazing at rambling roses over cottage walls and dawdling amid weathered willow trees. A line by AE Housman springs to mind: 'On the idle hill of summer, sleepy with the flow of streams'.\nThe sights:\nWest Stratton:\nA pleasant hamlet of cob walls and timber-framed cottages.\nMicheldever\n: A moderately-sized village of black and white cottages around a road junction. St Mary's Church has a perpendicular gothic tower that leads through to a delightful octagonal nave by George Dance the Junior (architect of St Bartholomew the Less in Smithfield, and the façade of the London Guildhall) from 1806.\nStoke Charity:\nA once larger settlement but much diminished, with the church standing alone in water meadows. It was once accompanied by the manor house of the De la Charité family from whom the village took part of its name. St Mary and St Michael is a picturesque but rather plain building from the C14 and C15, but its glory is internal, as no other church in Hampshire has such a collection of medieval and later monuments. There are brasses to the Hampton and Waller families and a remarkable sculpture of the Mass of St Gregory from c1500. Michaels is a C16 timber-framed house and Old Rectory is mid-C19 neo-Tudor. Norsebury House is from 1919 by Ernest Newton, a neo-Georgian encasing of a Victorian villa, with a matching wing of 2001.\nHunton:\nA small settlement with a church alone in the water meadows. St James is a small chapel, c1500.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll walk west along the Andover Road and turn south along Weston Down Road. At Weston, we'll turn west along Winchester Road and soon pick up a footpath to Hunton where we'll take Hunton Lane. At Hunton Church, we'll take a footpath over the River Dever southeast to Stoke Charity for a possible earlier lunch. We'll then head east along Sloe Lane and follow a loop around Micheldever to have a possible later lunch and a pub stop. Footpaths and bridleways will take us east to West Stratton and a lane will take us north to Larkwhistle Farm Road which we'll walk west along back to Micheldever Railway Station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "PLEASE READ ALL SECTIONS, INCLUDING WHAT TO BRING AND FOOD & DRINK\nYou can find out more about wild camping on this page:\nMy first wild camping event\n. You need to have mountain walking experience, good equipment and a good level of fitness to carry your food, sleeping bag, sleeping mat and small tent or bivvy bag for around 80 km (50 miles). We’ll walk about 20km (12.5 miles) each day. Sometimes it will be easy walking, other times we’ll be crossing parts of Dartmoor where there are no paths, rivers with no easy crossing points and rough boggy ground. The route will be partially determined by the water levels on the moor; we may need to change the route or walk late into the evenings if water levels increase. We may need to camp on exposed, wet, uneven ground.\nDartmoor has the best preserved prehistoric landscape in north western Europe. There are remains of over 5000 roundhouses, over 1500 cairns, and a remarkable set of ceremonial monuments dating from the late Neolithic to early Bronze age, including over 20\nstone circles\nand over 75\nstone rows\n. This trek visits the most impressive of these monuments. The\nfour day linear route\ncrosses Dartmoor from north to south, from\nOkehampton\nto\nIvybridge\n. Participants will need to make their own transport arrangements to the start and from the end. Trains run from Exeter St David's to Okehampton and Ivybridge. If coming by car, leaving the car in Exeter looks to be the best option (see the Location section below for details).\nOn the first day we'll visit Nine Maiden's Stone Circle, Cosdon Stone Rows (the most impressive prehistoric triple stone row in Britain), White Moor Stone Circle, Buttern Hill Stone Circle, Scorhill Stone Circle (Devon's finest stone circle) and Shovel Down Stone Rows.\nOn the second day we'll visit Fernworthy Stone Circle, Assycombe Stone Row, The Grey Wethers Stone Circles, Postbridge (shop and visitor centre), Lakehead Hill Stone Row & Cist, and Wistman's Wood (one the highest oakwoods and last remaining temperate rainforests in Britain). Depending on progress we might stop at the pub in Merrivale at the end of the day.\nOn the third day we'll visit the Merrivale Stone Rows & Stone Circle, Hart Tor Stone Rows, Down Tor Stone Row, Yellowmead Concentric Stone Circle, Ringmoor Stone Row and Brisworthy Stone Circle. On the last day we'll visit Drizzle Combe Stone Rows, Grim's Grave Cairn Circle, Erme Valley Stone Row (3.4 km long, the longest prehistoric stone row in the world) and Stalldown Stone Row.\nImage / photo credits:\nPhotos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 19 © Patrick Revell, used with permission.\nAll other photos\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n:\nPhoto 6 ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6359382\nPhoto 8 ©\nPete Cruse\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7990264\nPhoto 9 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406301\nPhoto 10 ©\nIan Capper\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7090708\nPhoto 11 ©\nVieve Forward\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6131085\nPhoto 12 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406389\nPhoto 13 and banner ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155589\nPhoto 14 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6404933\nPhoto 15 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410273\nPhoto 16 ©\nGuy Wareham\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/1911220\nPhoto 17 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6417803\nPhoto 18 ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155580\nPhoto 20 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410089\nPhoto 21 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6409234\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nSpurn point is what geologists call a 'spit', formed from the movement of sand and rocks down the coast by the tide over many years. This has resulted in a peninsula jutting out into the Humber estuary offering fantastic panoramic views across the north sea, mouth of the Humber, Northern Lincolnshire and west up the Humber estuary.\nWe'll take a walk out and back along the peninsula, which is a\nYorkshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve\n. In addition to the wildlife, throughout the walk we'll see reminders of the impact that WWII had on the area (e.g. tank traps, ruins of buildings, anti-aircraft gun mountings).\nThose of you who wish can visit the Easington Lighthouse (the tallest in Northern England) if it is open on the day. Access to the ground floor is free but entry to the upper levels is £4 adult/£3 concessions.\nPlease see the website for further details\n.\nContinuing on, we'll go past the RNLI station houses and boat launch which, sadly after 213 years of sea rescues, is now\nclosed\n. Toward the end of the peninsula we'll see the ruins of Spurn Point gun batteries and other defence-related structures.\nThere is a visitor centre and cafe near the car park, which has toilet facilities.\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the parts of the reserve that we will be accessing.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

In beautiful Rosedale, the charitable Ross Foundation and world renowned artist Andy Goldsworthy have combined to restore a series of ten barns, many formerly derelict, and turn them into a mind blowing art installation. This is not about a statue, or a painting, or poetry. Prepare to be amazed.\nHanging Stones has been conceived by Goldsworthy as a single artwork – the walk between each building is as much a part of the artwork as the buildings themselves. There are no images of the artwork on this event page in order to allow for maximum WOW factor on the walk.\nIt's a beautiful walk in its own right, using paths that are not public rights of way and only available for pre-booked groups. There are streams, meadows, pockets of woodland, moorland, all under glorious June sunshine (we hope).

    "Summary": "3 Nights - Friday to Monday\nYour event leaders Ian & Ste look forward to welcoming you to this stunning part of the Yorkshire Dales.\nVenture into the upper reaches of Swaledale for a three night stay in the scenic, quiet, less populated part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nThe campsite is both a working farm and brilliant well thought out site, with great facilities. The villages of Muker, Keld and Thwaite are not too far away, and all have either a pub or a nice teashop for those cream tea lovers! Did someone mention cream tea!!\nThere are several different easy lower routes branching out in deep cut valleys, well marked tracks ascending to the higher fells and many well used paths and bridleways for a decent selection of hiking and strolling options between villages.\nThe campsite sits in a narrow part of the valley close to a flowing beck with the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast National Trails only a short stroll away.  The main camping field has a gentle slope extending from the foot of the hill slope to the farm and facilities. The ground is well drained and the grass well managed for really good pitches. A quiet path avoids the roads to either of the two close villages a fifteen minute stroll away.\nThis is limestone country with waterfalls, limestone escarpments and deep gorges & wonderful wildflower meadows that carpet the landscape.\nGreat Shunner Fell, Kisdon and Lovely Seat are the nearest high ground and the steeper slopes offer picture postcard perspectives. There is plentiful evidence of mining here especially at Gunnerside Gill and the Cow'us (stone barns) are dotted about the drystone walled enclosures dating back hundreds of years.\nThere will be a small  selection of walks each day for those who like a challenge, or a mid level wander. If you would prefer to just relax and explore this area at a slower pace you are also welcome to join us here.\nWalk/activity options will be discussed at the event briefing on Friday evening once everyone has arrived & settled in etc.\nThe campsite facilities include lockers with phone charging, modern showers and plenty of toilets in a block in the centre of the site.  The on-site shop is well stocked with local produce and handy if you’ve forgot something.\nFire pits can be hired from the on-site shop along with firewood.\nIf you chose to bring a fire pit or BBQ then these must be raised off the ground, so to not damage the ground. Open fires are not permitted!\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nCampervans, Motorhomes, caravans:\nThese are permitted at no extra cost.\nDogs:\nThe site welcomes dogs as long as they are kept under close control as the camping field is beside the working farm.\nPhotos:\nThe photos used are courtesy of event leaders Steven & Ian and OutdoorLads member Craig B and are all used with their permission.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a big day in the mountains as we complete a circuit of some of Eryri's tallest hills, summitting six of the Carneddau's many peaks.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nYr Elen:\nAt 962m, this is the Carneddau's least visited peak, being a diversion on most classic routes. Our route takes us directly over the summit, giving us a great panorama of the rest of the Carneddau ridge.\nCarnedd Llywelyn :\nAt 1065m, this is our tallest peak and the summit of the Carneddau range; which is the highest area of upland habitat in the British Isles outside of Scotland. Due to it's vastness, the mountains are home to a large number of rare upland species, such as Hen Harriers, Ravens, Peregrine Falcons and Dotterels.\nFoel Grach:\nAt 976m, our third summit means the scabby hill, due the shattered rocks strewn over the summit. The summit also has a well built refuge, which will be a great lunch spot should the weather turn.\nCarnedd Gwenllian:\nAt 925m, our fourth hill has an interesting etymology. It's name was recently changed to be named after Gwenllian of Wales, the only daughter of the legendary Prince Llywelyn, from whom Carnedd Llywelyn gets it's name.\nBera Bach:\nAt 807m, this summit, our fifth, may be one of the most geologically interesting in the Carneddau, with rock stacks and shards shooting off in multiple directions. Scrambling to the top is good fun, provided the rocks are dry.\nDrosgl:\nAt 758m, our final summit may be the shortest, however may offer the most spectacular views. If the visibility is good we'll be able to see all along the North Wales coast and even as far as the Isle of Man.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants. If we do see them, make sure not to approach too closely, as they are wild and shouldn't be frightened.\nOther Information:\nSunday Walk:\nIf you want to make a weekend of it, come and join the Sunday walk to Aber Falls.\nAber Falls via The North Wales Pilgrim's Way | OutdoorLads\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility.

To the South, we'll have views into Eryri and the Carneddau mountains.\nAber Falls:\nThe highlight of the walk is this magnificent waterfall that crashes down from the Carneddau mountains. We can get close enough to get right by the falls, so make sure to bring some waterproofs.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants.

    "Summary": "Join Dan and OutdoorLads for a quiet weekend in the North Lakes!\nNewlands Valley\nOriginally called Rogersat or Rogersyde (derived from the Old Norse “Roger-Saetr”,\nSummer pasture belonging to Roger\n)\nthe Newlands Valley is one of the most picturesque and peaceful in the Lake District, with the settlements Keskadale, Skelgill, Birk Rigg, High Snab and Uzzicar all having their name origins from early Viking settlers.\nAfter a draining of the large marshy and swampy land at the foot of the valley between Portinscale and Braithwaite in the 13th century made it usable, the more modern name of \"Newlands\" came into being.\nAlong with its natural beauty the valley is home to one of the Lakes most famous mines, Goldscope, on the lower slopes of Hindscarth, and operated from the 16th to the end of the 19th century. It yielded such large amounts of lead and copper that it was called “Gottesgab” (God's Gift) by the German miners brought over to develop the mine in its early days.\nOur accommodation\nThis great little Lake District hostel is nestled in the quiet Newlands Valley, in the shadow of Cat Bells, Hindscarth, Robinson and Dale Head. The hostel itself is compact but well equipped, with a large kitchen, large boot/drying room, three dormitories and toilet/wash facilities. There's a nice common space for us to use that will lend itself well to decent conversation and board games!\nPlease note: Attendees will need to bring their own bedding (sleeping bags and pillowcases)\nItinerary\nFriday Evening -\nArrive at the hostel from 4pm and get settled in. A buffet supplied by everyone will be our evening meal (please bring something that can feed 1-2 people, it doesn't need to be complicated), followed by a welcome briefing from the Leader.\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast of cereals/toast/fruit will be available, and we will be looking to put on two, or possibly three, big walks for the day, depending on available Leaders and weather conditions. For a more relaxed day there is also the lovely town of Keswick and Derwent Water on our doorstep.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop the feet up and unwind from the day's activities. We will be putting together a two-course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided for once ,then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am. At this point some of our number may wish to return home while others may want to enjoy another smaller walk or visit to Keswick.\nWe are very sorry, but unfortunately Stair Cottage does not accept dogs. I know, I'm sad too.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Plus, we can go paddling in the sea and have a leisurely stroll along the miles of golden sand. Options will be discussed in more detail on the Friday evening. Do as much or as little as you like !\nThere are also two other walks on the same weekend should you wish to attend those;\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/railway-ramble-blaenau-ffestiniog-tan-y-bwlch-250607\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/events/railway-ramble-porthmadog-criccieth-250608\nOn Saturday evening we will aim to have a\nfire on the beach and my infamous Big Gay Musicals Quiz !\nDogs:\nWell behaved dogs are welcome, but must be\nkept on a\nlead at all times\nand owners must clean up after them.

This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

    "Summary": "Come and explore the Waterfall Country at the heart of the Brecon Beacons. Nestled into the southern slopes of the Fforest Fawr Massif, west of Merthyr Tydfil, Waterfall Country is one of the most beautiful and popular parts of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark, with steep, tree-lined gorges and an abundance of tumbling water.\nKnown in Welsh as Coed-y-Rhaeadr (Wood of the Water), Waterfall Country lies within the triangle formed by the villages of Hirwaun, Ystradfellte, and Pontneddfechan, where old red sandstone and a long belt of outcrop limestone have created a highly distinctive environment of wooded gorges, caves, swallow holes and waterfalls.\nOur campsite for the weekend is situated on the hillside above the Afon Hepste and very close to the spectacular four best known Ystradfellte waterfalls of,  Sgwd Clun-Gwyn (Falls of the White Meadow), Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn (Lower White Meadow falls),\nSgwd y Pannwr (Falls of the Woolen Washer) and the iconic Sgwd Yr Eira (Falls of Snow) where you traverse the naturally carved path behind the thunderous curtain of water.\nOn the Saturday I will be leading a 16km waterfalls walk from the campsite, taking in not only these spectacular four waterfalls, but also an additional four named waterfalls, as well as numerous cascades along the route.\nIf you don’t fancy joining us for our walk and/or want to do your own thing, there is always the option to just relax at our campsite with views overlooking the scenic Welsh countryside, or perhaps drive to one of the local attractions such as  Penderyn Distillery visitor centre (15 mins), Mountain Biking at Bike Park Wales (35 mins) or the National Showcaves Centre for Wales (25 mins).\nDogs\n: Dogs are welcome on the campsite but you will be expected to be considerate of other campers and clear up behind them.  There may be sheep in adjacent fields so please take this into account if you are thinking of bringing your dog, which will need to be under control at all times when on the site.\nCampervans, Motorhomes\n: Whilst this event is primarily a camping event, it should be possible to cater for these, but please be aware that the surrounding roads are not ideal for wider/longer vehicles.  Please message the leader to discuss.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The ferry is included in the event price.\nFind out more...\nYou can read more about the island and its history on the\nNational Trust's website\nand on\nWikipedia.\nThe\nNational Trust's access leaflet\nincluding a map is also available.\nDogs\nSadly dogs are not allowed on the island nor in the hostel.  If you need to bring an assistance dog for a disability please let us know so this can be arranged.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Summary": "Note: Please only join this event if you're happy to pay £5 to visit Lowfield Heath Windmill (pay closer to the day of the walk or on the day itself).\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\n...And other such aeolian/barometric clichés about success. The two main selling points of this walk are a private tour of Lowfield Heath Windmill, a Grade-II listed post mill of 1737, and a stretch at the end of Gatwick's runway where the planes seem to brush one's scalp as they ascend. Charlwood has over 80 listed buildings, including a church with extensive wall paintings from 1350, and central to which is a ghostly depiction of 'The Three Living and The Three Dead'. Upmarket suburbanisation and the roar of planes gaining or losing height may have erased most feeling of the past, but the views, woods and fields are charming, the low-flying planes exciting and what history remains, fascinating.\nThe sights:\nCapel:\n'One long and rather nondescript street along the [old] Worthing Road, a mixture of Weald cottages and the cheerful C19 brick of hamlets like Holmwood' (Ian Nairn:\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n). St John Baptist Church is C13, but rebuilt in 1865. Lots of good Weald farms from the C16 and C17.\nCharlwood:\n'A Weald village on the Sussex border, near Crawley New Town (and now even nearer to Gatwick...). Plenty of old cottages remain, both tile-hung and timber-framed, but the remoteness and sense of place have gone' (Nairn). St Nicholas Is Norman, with a C13 aisle and windows. Grade I-listed. Wall paintings from c.1350, which include the story of 'The Three Quick (Living) and the Three Dead' in which three proud young kings meet three skeletons as a\nmemento mori\n. A common Black Death-era trope and now quite faded. Large medieval rood screen.\nLowfield Heath Windmill:\nThe website says: 'The survival of Lowfield Heath Windmill is almost as remarkable as the story of its restoration in the hands of a dedicated and committed group of local people. The Mill was originally built at Lowfield Heath in 1737-8 and now stands on the edge of Charlwood village [it was moved when Gatwick's runways were extended]. It took thirteen years of hard work and great skill to dismantle, repair and re-erect the Mill. It has four floors, with an external staircase leading to the second floor, from where internal ladders rise to two further floors. It also has a small visitor centre within the roundhouse.' The windmill isn't normally open on the day of the walk but I have arranged with the manager for him to open it for us and provide tours in shifts during our lunchtime.\nGatwick Airport:\nThe second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow, and the eighth busiest in Europe. It covers a total area of 674 hectares (1,670 acres). 'Gatwick' was from a farm, long lost, meaning 'goat farm'. The airport opened as an aerodrome in the late 1920s, and it has been in use for commercial flights since 1933, becoming a major airport in 1958. The airport has two terminals, North Terminal and South, and a single-runway which is 3316 metres long. A subsidiary runway is available but, due to its proximity to the main one, can only be used if the main runway is not in use. In February 2025, the government announced plans to move the secondary runway by 12 m north and open it to continuous use. Planes currently take off and land alternately. Although Gatwick is reportedly one of the worst in the UK for watching planes landing and taking off, a footpath we'll follow will allow great views.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll head east from Ockley Station along Coles Lane and cross the A24 in two goes as there is a wide grassy central reservation. We'll then follow The Street to Capel church where we'll proceed along Vicarage Lane. At Temple Lane we'll turn south before turning east and using footpaths to go from Aldhurst Farm to Tanhurst Farm. At the Rusper Road we'll continue east along Duke's Road. At Boothlands Farm, we'll pick up Charlwood Lane, then Russ Hill Lane to go to the windmill for lunch. At Charlwood Church we'll veer round and follow a path south, almost to Ifield. At Ifieldwood we'll follow a path west to The Manor Farm then Langhurst Farm almost to Rusper. Capel Road and then footpaths past Lyne Farm and Pleystowe Farm will take us north back to Capel where we'll walk down Coles Lane back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them (unless the weather is really hot), but there will be some stiles, busy roads and fields with sheep and cattle. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nIMPORTANT!

Then later it becomes a lively space with entertainment, and a well-stocked bar open into the early hours.\nOur OutdoorLads bar will be full stocked with a range of real ales, lager, cider, wines, a whole smorgasbord of spirits and soft drinks to delight and tantalise. There will be two spaces - the clubhouse with a DJ and entertainment, and the marquee will be a more chilled out space in \"The Outdoor Inn\" - our very own OutdoorLads pub, where you can chat, socialise, and play board games without the disco dancing.\nSaturday Night Disco\n🕘 Step Back in Time 🕒\nFrom Cleopatra to Cave men, Romans to Royalty and Greek Gods to Lady Godiva and everything in between. The BSC Saturday Night Disco theme this year is… Step Back In Time!! History is coming to a dance floor near you!\nFood\nYou can cook for yourself camp-style, (BBQ's and camping stoves MUST be raised off the floor by a minimum of 50cm to prevent damaging the grass - open fires are not permitted). Or, you can purchase breakfasts and evening meals from the clubhouse.  You'll even be able to grab yourself a packed lunch to take out on your activities with you! We'll be keeping the menu simple and focussing on quality ingredients, delivered to you with short waiting times.\nProvisional Menus >\nSaturday Packed Lunch >\nSunday Packed Lunch >\nTents and Campervans\nBIG Spring Camp is primarily a camping event, by which we mean in tents. If you don't have a tent, we will have some available for you to hire at a cost of £15. Booking for these will open on Monday 3 March 2025 at 7pm.\nBorrow a tent >\nFor those of you with caravans, campervans, and motorhomes - we have a\nvery limited\nnumber of pitches (max 20) available at an additional cost. Demand for these spaces does always exceed supply, so we can't guarantee you'll get a space, and we are unfortunately unable to make more spaces available due to the limitations of the venue. Booking for these will open on Monday 3 March 2025 at 7pm.\nBook a campervan spot >\nCommunity!\nNew Members\nIf you're new (or relatively new) to OutdoorLads and worried about not knowing anybody when you get to BIG Spring Camp, then worry not! This is a super friendly event, and through taking part in activities, volunteering, or joining in the fun on-site, it's so easy to get to know others at the event. You can join one of our smaller new member camps, led by some of our amazing, approachable volunteers, who'll help introduce you to others on the first evening. You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent.\nSign up >\nChat Group\nJoin our chat group on Telegram to catch up with others attending BIG Spring Camp, arrange lift shares, share photos etc.\nOutdoorLads.events/BSC25Chat\nVolunteering\nOutdoorLads is built upon people volunteering, and BIG Spring Camp is no exception! This event's success is dependent on volunteers stepping forward to help it run.  We have our BIG Events Team, who's primary purpose of being at the event is to help out. But, we also need additional volunteers to help out with with registration, car parking, bar work, and food service / kitchen portering. Volunteering is a great way to get to know others at the event, as you'll talk to so many people throughout your shift.\nRegister your interest in volunteering >\nPrevious Email Communications\n7 March >\n11 April >\n28 April >\nCampsite Information\nSite Map\nThe camp is in a fantastic spot near Betws-y-Coed in the Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, North Wales.

    "Summary": "WOW This event filled quickly!  If you are disappointed that you've not managed to secure a place, please can you use the waiting list functionally, and then if there is sufficient demand we will attempt to secure additional accommodation.\nCity breaks are less formal and structured than our usual hostel breaks, you’ll have free time or time to do the suggested activities below but they are all suggestions, city breaks do not have the usual Friday night buffet but places to eat as a group will be suggested. Of course you may wish do your own thing, or break into smaller groups as preferred.\nAn elegant city full of traditional heritage, contemporary culture, green spaces and a few surprises.\nBuilt for pleasure and relaxation, beautiful Bath has been a wellbeing destination since Roman times. The waters are still a big draw today, both at the ancient Roman Baths and the modern Thermae Bath Spa, which houses the only natural thermal hot springs in Britain you can bathe in. Bath’s compact centre is full of places to eat and drink, plus some of the finest independent shops in Britain, making it the ideal city break.\nBath's stunning, honey-coloured Georgian architecture is straight from a Jane Austen novel; highlights include the iconic Royal Crescent and the majestic Circus which we will visit in our guided tour on Saturday morning.\nWhat’s going to happen\nItinerary:\nDay 1:\nArrive at our accommodation at 5pm Friday afternoon, meet & greet reception before heading off out for local dinner and drinks.\nPossibility of a Ghost tour before or after evening dinner :\nBath Ghost Tours - Visit Bath\nDay 2:\nAfter optional breakfast in our accommodation we will head out on a leisurely city walk with a local guide -\nWalks for groups\nThis is followed by an optional afternoon tour of\nBath Abbey\nor visit to the\nAmerican Museum & Gardens\n-\nIn the evening we will reconvene at the hostel before we join up with a local outdoor lads social at\nThe Real Italian Pizza Company.\n.

    "Summary": "Come queen of months in company / Wi' all thy merry minstrelsy / The restless cuckoo absent long / And twittering swallows chimney song / And hedge row crickets notes that run / From every bank that fronts the sun / And swathy bees about the grass / That stop wi' every bloom they pass\n(John Clare: 'The Shepherd's Calendar - May')\nStarting a walk at a busy railway station means that the convenience of the trains is offset by the drag of walking along suburban streets before getting to the countryside. Twenty percent of the walk will be through the suburbs of Haywards Heath and not in the marvellous Maytime Wealden countryside, but eighty percent will be. The suburbs do, however, lead to the village of Lindfield 'without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex'. Beyond Lindfield is Danefield (burial place of 'Carry On' actor Peter Butterworth and his wife, the actor and impressionist Janet Brown), a tea shop at a farm, and handsome houses linked by the hedgerow-lined tracks and trails evoked in the poem above.\nThe sights:\nHaywards Heath:\nA Victorian new town started on the site of a Civil War battle in 1642 when the railway arrived in 1841. A dormitory town for commuters to London and Brighton with pleasant housing estates stretching out.\nLindfield:\nAdjoining Haywards Heath but with its own character. 'Without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex' (Pevsner:\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n). (In 1974 relocated to West Sussex.) Around 40 ancient buildings line the high street, around half of medieval origin. 'The alternation of timber-framing and stately Georgian brick is the leitmotif' (Pevsner). Some buildings of note: Church Cottage and Thatched Cottage (C15); Old Place (1590); Lindfield House (C18); Lindfield Place (early C18)...you get the idea. St John Baptist Church is mainly c1300 with shingled broach spire and decorated gothic windows and porch. East Mascalls is a Grade II* listed manor from 1578.\nDanehill:\nNot much of a definite village centre, but a small green near the church where we can have our packed lunches. All Saints Church is 1892, by Bodley and Garner, and is serious and imposing, unlike two of its graveyard's occupants; actors Peter Butterworh (1913-1979) who appeared in most of the Carry On films from 1965 (\nCarry On Cowboy\n) to 1978 (\nCarry On Emmanuelle\n) and his wife Janet Brown (1923-2011) known for impersonating Margaret Thatcher, including in the James Bond film\nFor Your Eyes Only\n(1981). We'll have tea and cake at Heaven Farm, just outside of the village.\nThe\nroute\n(clock the link to see it)\n:\nSydney Road, West Common and Lindfield High Street will take us northeast out of town. We'll then pick up the Sussex Diamond Trail (SDT) which will take us all the way to Danehill, barring a short stretch along Church Lane. After lunch, we'll head south along Church Lane again and then the A275 to Heaven's Farm for tea and cake. The SDT and the Sussex Ouse Valley Way will take us almost back to Haywards Heath but we'll have to use Snowdrop Lane, Lyoth Lane, Gravelye Lane, Westlands Road, Hanbury Lane, Washington Road and Oatlands Avenue generally heading west, then a walk through the park, then Perrymount Road going north to get back fully.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT! Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\n(All pictures were taken by the leader on his recce in May 2025.)",

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.\nAs this is a National Trust campsite, the facilities are top-notch with clean and heated showers, and your typical National Trust camp shop.\nWe've reserved a designated 'patch' in the campsite so we'll all be camping together.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome at the campsite, although please note the National Trust's\nrules for dogs as listed on this site\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The Isle of Wight has a character all of its own, and the rugged south of the island ('The Back') doubly so. The climate is almost subtropical, so glasshouse plants proliferate and bloom outside. The local sandstone is also distinct and so the cottages and churches look more like Dorset than Hampshire.\nThe Wee:\nThe retro Godshill Model Village, with the places we'll be seeing meticulously miniaturised.\nThe Twee:\nThe model village and the cottages orné of Shanklin Old Village - twee, but enjoyably so.\nThe Wowee:\nThe prettiest villages on the island (Godshill and Shanklin Old Village), the highest hill and best view likewise (St Boniface Down)(Plus, the 'aah factor': we'll drop in on the freebie Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary!)\nThe sights:\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary:\nThe\nwebsite\nstates:\n'\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary has 118 donkeys, 1 mule and 22 ponies, all of whom are either rescued or abandoned. They are given a ‘forever home’ in 55 acres of countryside in the Wroxall valley where they get first class care and welfare.' Admission is free but a donation is welcome.\nGodshill:\nThe show village of the island with its mellow church tower rising above immaculate thatched cottages. All Saints Church, mostly 15th-century, perched on a hilltop. Spacious interior adorned with some notable features: Medieval wall-painting of Christ on a 'lily cross' - one of only two in Europe; C18 monuments to the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe; big painting of\nDaniel in the Lions' Den\n, perhaps by Rubens.\nGodshill Model Village\n:\nThe tourist traps of Godshill and Shanklin Old Village reproduced at 1/10th scale. 'You can find all of our houses, cottages, churches and pubs in real life for a proper Gulliver [or Godzilla (Godshilla?)-suited] experience! Our models are fantastic replicas of these real buildings, made with sand and cement so they weather as they age. We even thatch them just like the real thing' (the website). The abundant conifers, trimmed to maintain scale, are equally notable. £7.00 to enter. We'll take the recommended 45 minutes to explore it over lunch, but if it's not your thing, you're welcome to go to the pub or explore the village and miss this quintessentially English piece of quirkiness.\nAppuldurcombe House:\nThe shell of a large and very fine C18 baroque mansion, built 1702-1740 for the Worsley family by John James. Requisitioned by the military and bombed by enemy action in 1943 and left a ruin. Managed by English Heritage. Freemantle Arch, 1770s, perhaps by James Wyatt. We won't be entering the house, just seeing the exterior.\nSt Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down:\nChalk hills rising to 241 metres, the island's highest point, In 1940 the radar station was bombed by Stukas, a scene reconstructed in the film\nThe Battle of Britain\n. Ecologically a rare juxtaposition of calcareous downland and acid grassland-heathland with acid-loving gorse, heather, bell heather and bilberry meeting alkaline-loving juniper and box. The cap of gravel supports a forest of holm oak. The views, south to the sea and north over the island to the mainland are truly stupendous.\nShanklin:\nA popular seaside resort with an esplanade lined with hotels and cafes and a sandy beach occupying a broad bay. The pier was lost in a storm in 1987.\nShanklin Old Village:\nA picturesque cluster of old cottages and Victorian cottages ornés, mostly now cafes, restaurants and touristy shops.\nShanklin Chine\n:\n'Chine' is a local term for a coastal ravine. Shanklin Chine contains waterfalls, trees and lush vegetation, with footpaths and walkways allowing access. Red squirrels are being supported and a section of PLUTO (PipeLine Under The Ocean), installed to supply petrol for the D-Day Landings, is visible. The Chine costs £8.50 to enter and doing so is optional.\nIsland Line Railway:\nNewly refurbished London Underground Class 484 trains (converted from D-78 stock) serve on the Island Line network. These replaced the 82-year-old Class 483 trains from 1938 that served on the island for 32 years until 2020.\nWightlink catamarans:\nHSC Wight Ryder I\nand\nHSC Wight Ryder II\nare high-speed craft in service from 2009. The sun deck makes the sea crossing great fun.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to the Ordnance Survey website to see the ascents and descents):\nShanklin's streets will soon give way to countryside via a converted railway line out to Lower Hyde and beyond. At Winstone Farm we'll leave the old railway and head west to the Donkey Sanctuary. Hitting the Stenbury Trail, we'll go into Godshill where we'll have just over an hour to see the model village and church and have lunch. Footpaths and the Worsley Trail will take us south and east out of Godshill to Appuldurcombe House. Footpaths and Rew Lane will then take us to Wroxall Down via Homelands Pit Farm.

Situated just to the North West of the City of Bristol, it is easily accessible from M5 Junction 17 and 18.\nCommencing from the car park, we walk across to the 18th century Blaise Castle House Museum, the home of the social history collection.  We then walk down to Stratford Mill and follow the tree lined limestone gorge of Hazel Brook, along which you will find Tarn Lake and Penny Well.  Hazel Brook then joins into the River Trym at Coombe Dingle, and we continue to follow the course of the river through a mix of woodland and grass meadows down to where it meets the River Avon.\nFrom here the route follows the Avon for a short distance before walking along the southern edge of Shirehampton Golf course (be alert for shouts of FOUR!), before heading into the grounds of Kings Weston House, towards Penpole Point.  Travelling back towards the Blaise Castle estate we will lunch beside the 18th century grade 1 listed Kings Weston House, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1712 who also designed Blenheim Palace.  There is a coffee shop here, where you can get yourself a drink or ice cream.\nThe final leg of today’s walk takes us past two follies.  The first of which is at the top of the Kings Weston estate, then passing through hill top limestone meadows and along to an Iron Age hill fort we get to grade II listed 18th century Blaise Castle folly, built by Robert Mylne in 1766 for wealthy Bristol merchant Thomas Farr, which featured in Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey.  The Blaise castle estate was also the backdrop for the village of Avalon in the 2023 Arthurian drama The Winter King.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Returning to one of OutdoorLads' favourite bunkhouses in a remote part of Northumberland for THREE nights, this will be a get away from it all weekend. This is a Friday to Monday trip!\nOur venue is located 4 miles from the nearest public road, deep into the Cheviots, along the College Valley. It lies less than 1/2 mile from the Scottish border, sandwiched between the border ridge and the Cheviot (815m).\nIt is surrounded by beautifully rounded Northumberland Hills, close to the northern end of the Pennine Way, with deep, wild valleys, and dramatic gullies created at the end of the last ice age.\nThis will be a remote, away-from-it-all weekend, where phone signals and wi-fi are unlikely, which is a magical chance to connect with OutdoorLads pals and the spectacular scenery that surrounds us. We'll spend two days getting out and exploring on foot - walks are necessarily going to involve some steep climbs and there are no \"gentle\" options - but you'll be rewarded for your efforts with spectacular views!\nThe evenings will be filled with hearty, home-cooked meals, and socialising with fellow OutdoorLads - board games and star gazing are likely to be high on the list of evening entertainment. It will be a fantastic weekend of comradery, great food, and genuinely getting out more!\nThe Hills\nThe\nCheviot Hills\nare a range of rolling hills straddling the Scottish Border with Northumberland. The English section is within the Northumberland National Park. The range includes The Cheviot (the highest hill), plus Hedgehope Hill, Windy Gyle, Cushat Law and Bloodybush Edge.\nThe hills are sometimes considered a part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland as they adjoin the uplands to the north. Since the Pennine Way runs through the region, the hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the Northumberland National Park.\nSome of the gems are in between the hills.\nHen Hole\nis one such place and it makes a wonderful route to the top of the Cheviot from the Hostel. It was created at the end of the last ice age, by meltwater, creating a deep gully with waterfalls, leading up to an amazing basin underneath the Cheviot summit. With some very easy scrambles, it makes a fantastic route to highest point in this whole range of hills.\nWildlife in the College Valley (not that we're guaranteed to see it all!)\nThe valley is well known for its population of\nferal goats\nand is home to around 150. Rumour has it that they were released in medieval times by the monks on Holy Island. This primitive British breed would have died out completely if they hadn't escaped into the wild. As farming changed there was a swing to foreign breeds which produced more milk. The goats can often be seen on the Newton Tors along the eastern side of the Valley. However they can pop up in the most unexpected of places! Over the years many goats have been re-homed to help manage environments elsewhere in the UK and this has helped to ease the pressure on local vegetation.\nRoe deer\nare present throughout the valley. Whilst they are beautiful they also bring their own challenges with damage to trees so their numbers are carefully managed.\nThe valley has a healthy population of\nred squirrels\n. Hazelnuts are a great source of proteins for the squirrels. With care and quiet you could be lucky and see one of these lovely little mammals.\nAdders\n, Britain's only venomous reptile are also present in the valley.\nSlow worms\n, which are really burrowing limbless lizards (commonly mistaken for snakes) are also common. They have been granted protected status along with all other native British reptiles.\nOtters\nare present along the College and Lambden burns.\nThere is a good population of\nrabbits\n,\nhares\n,\nvoles\n,\nfox\n,\nstoat\nand\nweasels\n. These can be seen throughout the valley.\nCollege Valley Estate has spent a lot of time and effort reintroducing\nblack grouse\n, a marvellous bird at risk of imminent extinction in the UK. Black grouse UK, part of the UK Biodiversity plan, is dedicated to reversing this trend towards extinction. In 1995 the Wilderness above Mounthooly was planted with over 55000 broadleaves. This became the largest new native woodland in England. Black grouse were initially quite successful but bad weather has affected recent breeding seasons and numbers have declined.\nThere is a healthy and well managed population of\nred grouse\non all the heather areas in the valley; shooting for these remarkable birds provides a significant income for the estate. The sound of them telling one to 'go-back, go-back, go-back' is one of the sounds of wilderness areas.\nDogs\n. This event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos.\nAll photos taken by Rob Mitchell, OutdoorLads and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington.

We head out of town along the Wharfe River past Burnsall before a tough climb up from Appletreewick to Greenhow Hill.\nThe cycle route down to\nPateley Bridge\nfrom there on the B-Road is twisty and steep, with traffic. An alternative is to bypass the section on a quieter and less-trafficked, but still steep (down) in places country lane.  We can decide on the day what we'd prefer.\nPateley Bridge is the perfect place to stop for a cream tea, and to refuel for the next climb. It's also the home of the\nOldest Sweet Shop in the World\n- super sour fizz balls, anyone?  The road out of town leads to\nBrimham Rocks\n, a National Trust-owned property with weird and wonderful rock formations we may briefly cycle through.\n8km further on we cycle through the grounds of the stunning\nFountains Abbey\nWorld Heritage Site - a stunning assembly of history: the ruined Cistercian abbey, the landscape gardens, the medieval deer park before reaching\nRipon\n, where we'll stop for lunch. (A 10km shorter route bypasses Fountains Abbey and Ripon, with lunch in Bishop Monkton instead - we'll decide before we set off which route to take).\nAfter lunch the Way of the Roses meanders down the Ouse River valley, along quiet country lanes before crossing the Ouse on the rickety Aldwark Toll Bridge, which is free for cyclists.  The route is almost entirely flat between Ripon and York, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n98km (61 miles) with 890m (2,919ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(Shorter route on\nCycle.Travel here\n).\n**\nYou will need to book your own accommodation in York, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in York.  Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn City Centre (Layerthorpe).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL; Image 6: Aldwark Toll Bridge\n© Andrew Whale and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; all other images Pixabay Public Domain.",

    "Summary": "Introduction:\nLast year it was an Isle of Wight Double. This year it's an all-new Dorset (plus a bit of Devon) Double, taking place on the Saturday and Sunday of the late-May Bank Holiday weekend. Campsites and B&Bs might be a little hard to find later on and expensive as the late May Bank Holiday weekend is at the start of the half-term holiday, so you are advised to book right now. Demand for the Double Event may be reduced as Big Spring Camp will be running at the same time, but even so, I hope you can come and experience a double-bill of outstanding coastal walks on the Jurassic Coast, centred on Lyme Regis, the 'Pearl of Dorset', a place equipped with an array of B&Bs and campsites.\nSchedule:\nDay 1 (Saturday 24 May): Seaton and Beer to Lyme Regis and Charmouth\n- linear walk with bus from Lyme Regis/Charmouth to the starting point at Seaton.\nDay 2 (Sunday 25 May): Lyme Regis and Charmouth to Whitchurch Canonicorum, Ryall and Golden Cap - circular walk.\nPublic transport to Lyme Regis and Charmouth:\nRail:\nThe nearest railway station is Axminster, which is served by hourly direct services from London Waterloo on a journey lasting 2 hours, 42 minutes.\nLocal buses:\nBuses from Axminster Railway Station to Lyme Regis and Charmouth depart at 15 minutes past the hour (except at 16.25 and 17.20).\nThe last bus service leaves Axminster Railway Station at 18.15\n. They take 25 and 30 minutes to get to Lyme Regis and Charmouth respectively and go near the campsites.\nAccommodation:\nBook for at least\nFriday 23 May to Sunday 25 May\n(3 nights). The following day is Bank Holiday Monday.\nYou are advised to book now\nif you can.\n(By way of a disclaimer, I don't know what any of these sites are like; they're just in the vicinity.)\nCampsites:\nChoose one near Charmouth, such as\nCummins Farm\n. There is also\nManor Farm\nwhich does caravans and chalets too. If you want to stay in Uplyme (which is outside of Lyme Regis, and is a little far out of town), try\nHook Farm\n. I reckon Cummins Farm is best for traditional, basic camping.\nCaravans, glampers and pods sites:\nNewlands Farm\nand\nWood Farm\n. These sites are both in Charmouth, have extensive facilities, but are family-oriented.\nB&Bs:\nChoose one in, or within a mile of, Lyme Regis or Charmouth. Search Booking.com\nhere\n.\nDay 2 - Lyme Regis to Golden Cap:\nThis is a circular walk that spends a little more time inland before returning to the majesty of the coastline. Those staying in Lyme Regis will get extra distance to cover, but with the benefit of a walk along the shore where abundant fossils may be found. There will be three main ascents: the first is Hardown Hill, which is an Iron Age hillfort; the second is Golden Cap, which is the highest point on the south coast at 191 metres; the third is merely a hill outside Charmouth. All three points will offer magnificent views over land and over sea. In addition, there will be some lovely little villages such as Whitchurch Canonicorum, whose church contains the only intact saints’ reliquary in England.\nDay 2 - the sights:\nCharmouth:\nA picturesque coastal village known for its stunning Jurassic Coast scenery and rich fossil-hunting opportunities. Its origins go back to Roman times. During the Saxon period, it was known as 'Cernmunde' and the village witnessed fierce Viking battles in the C9. It grew into a small medieval market town, benefiting from its location on ancient trade routes. Its cliffs, part of the UNESCO Jurassic Coast, are famous for fossils, attracting naturalists since the C19. It is now suburbanised but retains its charm.\nWhitchurch Canonicorum:\nA picturesque village in Marshwood Vale, renowned for its historic church, St. Candida and Holy Cross, which contains the only church shrine in Britain to have survived the Reformation with its relics intact, those of St Candida (St Wite), a Christian martyred by the Danes, or alternatively a West Saxon anchoress (a female religious recluse). (Westminster Abbey also contains a saint's relics, those of Edward the Confessor.)\nRyall:\nA pleasant hamlet nestled in Marshwood Vale. Surrounded by rolling hills and lush countryside, it offers superb views. Known for its close-knit community and rural charm.\nHardown Hill and Hillfort:\nIts prominence of over 150m qualifies it as one of Dorset's four Marilyns and it is listed as one of the 'top 12 Dorset views to take your breath away' by Dorset's official tourist website, with expansive views over the Marshwood Vale. The hillfort (Iron Age, spanning approximately 800 BCE to 43 CE) features earthen ramparts and ditches, though much is eroded.\nGolden Cap:\nThe highest point on the southern coast of England, rising 191 meters (627 feet). Composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily sandstone, limestone and shale, it forms part of the cliffs that showcase the region's rich geological history. Part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its geological importance. The site provides stunning panoramic views, and its distinctive golden-hued cliffs are a popular destination for hikers, geologists, and nature enthusiasts alike.\nFossil hunting:\nThe area is renowned for its abundance of fossils (exposed as we'll be passing at low tide) due to its unique geology and ongoing coastal erosion. Key reasons include:\nJurassic Period Rocks: The cliffs around Charmouth are composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily shale and limestone, formed around 200 million years ago during the Jurassic period. These rocks preserve a wide range of marine life from this era.\nContinual Erosion: Natural erosion caused by waves, wind, and rain constantly exposes new fossil layers, making fossils accessible on the beach.\nVariety of Fossils: The area was a marine environment during the Jurassic, so it contains numerous fossils of ammonites, belemnites, ichthyosaurs, and other ancient marine creatures.\nSoft Mudstones: The clay-rich Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone formations are relatively soft, allowing fossils to be easily revealed and extracted without extensive excavation.\nDay 2 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThose staying in Lyme Regis will start at The Square and walk along the coast to Charmouth (the tide will be low). We'll ascend Lower Sea Lane and pick up the guys staying in Charmouth. We'll then head east along The Street and Berne Lane and cross the A35, continuing on Berne Lane as far as Whitchurch Canonicorum, where we'll follow Lower Street, then Higher Street to Ryall. We'll then make our first ascent: up Hardown Hillfort. We'll then take footpaths to the A35 and over Muddyford Lane to ascend Golden Cap. The South West Coast Path (SWCP) will return us to Charmouth, and those staying in Lyme Regis can continue back on foot (along the shore or using the SWCP) or by bus.\nBe assured that I will be reconnoitering this route to check that it works!\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but some of it is under trees so will be cooler. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It is situated in a smugglers' cove, and caves were once used to store contraband goods. Beer Stone has long been prized because of its workability for carving and for its gentle yellow colour. Quarrying, fishing and lace production were the sources of income until tourism and model railways developed (Peco, founded 1946, has its head office and factory in the village.)\nSeaton:\nA seaside town and fishing harbour with an attractive promenade. The town was small and centred around fishing and farming until the arrival of the railway (now a preserved tramway) in 1868 when it became a resort. Many of the buildings are Victorian, but it also has notable buildings from the 1930s.\nBeer to Seaton Cliffs:\nTo the east of Seaton are the red-coloured cliffs of Triassic age rocks, capped by younger rocks (Cretaceous) of the greensand. The Seaton Fault, which is visible at Seaton Hole at the western end of the beach, allows the chalk into the sequence which runs to Beer Head.\nAxmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff: '\nA sheltered wooded wilderness...situated on one of the most active coastal landslide systems in Western Europe with a band of folds and troughs constantly evolving and being shaped and reshaped by landslips [where greensand rocks slump on soft clay]. The Undercliff has a reputation for being the closest thing you’ll get to a rainforest in the UK with a warm and humid microclimate nurturing a carpet of ferns, fungi, wild clematis and orchids beneath a dense leafy canopy...It’s also home to a variety of birds and wildlife including ravens, peregrine falcons and owls as well as reptiles and amphibians such as grass snake, common lizard and great crested newt...One of the many highlights of the route is Goat Island, famous for being the first ever scientifically described and recorded landslip...The landslip became very famous and was visited by Queen Victoria.' (From the 'Love Lyme Regis'\nwebsite\n.)\nJurassic Coast:\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, crucial for its rich geological history spanning 185 million years. Its cliffs reveal layers from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, offering insights into Earth's past. Renowned for fossils, it attracts scientists, educators, and tourists, blending natural beauty with historical significance.\nLyme Regis:\n'The Pearl of Dorset' is a gorgeous seaside town. Visitors can explore its quaint streets lined with independent shops, galleries, and restaurants and holidaymakers can enjoy its sandy beach. Dating back to Saxon times, its name derived from the River Lim. Granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1284, it became 'Regis' (of the King) and thrived as a port. The Cobb, a huge sea wall, first constructed in the C13, supported the town’s maritime trade. Lyme Regis played a role in significant events, including the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685. The town gained fame for its connections to paleontology, particularly through Mary Anning’s discoveries of fossil plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs in the C19. Lyme Regis has inspired film and literature, most notably in Jane Austen’s\nPersuasion\n, where the Cobb sets pivotal scenes. John Fowles’\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\nportrays the town, with the Cobb central to the novel and its 1981 film adaptation with Meryl Streep.\nDay 1 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThe bus will drop us at the western end of Seaton Esplanade where we'll take the inland branch of the South West Coast Path (SWCP) and follow Beer Road, Old Beer Road and New Road to Beer. After time to explore Beer, we'll meet up by the bay, and pick up the coastal branch of the SWCP back to Seaton and walk along Seaton seafront. We'll then cross the River Axe and using Squire's Lane, ascend the hills and clifftops that will take us all the way back to Lyme Regis. We'll emerge at the point that the Cobb attaches to the land. Members can explore Lyme Regis or take the bus back to Charmouth if they need.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but much of it is under trees so will be cooler. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\n(All images were taken by the leader on his recce in May 2025. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

    "Summary": "Gosaikunda Trek and Raft Expedition\nOur Gosaikunda trekking and rafting expedition offers a little bit of everything Nepal has to offer neatly packaged into a two week expedition. We will trek off the beaten track for seven days from the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley into the stunning Langtang region of Nepal.\nThe trek starts at Sundarija just a short drive from Kathmandu. It enters the mountains through the Shivapuri National Park before crossing the Lauribina pass at 4,610m. This the site of the sacred Gosaikunda lakes; a Hindu pilgrimage site linked to Shiva’s trident.\nWe descend from Gosaikunda to the next phase of the expedition on the Trisuli river which is a 4-hour drive from the end of the trek.. We spend two days rafting on the Trisuli river and then travel to Chitwan National Park. Here it is possible to see elephants, crocodiles, rhino and perhaps a tiger. After two nights in Chitwan we fly back to Kathmandu on an internal flight.\nOutdoorLads has organised this expedition to see the most thrilling locations Nepal has to offer with minimal time spent on long bus journeys. It offers a chance to get off the beaten track and really get to know Nepal.\nOur trip organizer (and OutdoorLads Member) Nick Read, is a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs Pride Expeditions.  He has led an OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and 2017 and a raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012.

    "Summary": "This event now takes place Saturday 17th of May 2025, in the theatre's studio theatre.\nThe musical version of The Wizard of Oz, starring the legendary Judy Garland, marks its 86th anniversary in 2025 and - to commemorate that landmark release the film's enduring popularity and Garland's as an LGBT+ icon - the amateur theatre are honouring the significant event with: Over the Rainbow - Celebrating the Friends of Dorothy and Their Allies. Featuring a performance of Darren Stewart-Jones' The Judy Monologues, the show will wind it's way through LGBT+ themes inspired by the movie to celebrate generations of The Friends of Dorothy and those who have supported them over the last 85 years.\nJudy Garland's version of The Wizard of Oz has been with us for over 85 years and, with it, the phrase 'A friend of Dorothy', meaning a gay man. These elements have been the inspiration for this event and our selection of pieces for Over the Rainbow.\nThe event opens with Munchalot by Ann Morgan, a comic prequel to The Wizard of Oz, which sees the fabled Yellow Brick Road under construction.\nIn Journey's End by Paul Whitby, the recently bereaved Nic runs into an impossibly familiar face. Meanwhile, US Military Intelligence faces an unexpected challenge in Cary Pepper's Friending Dorothy, the play discovers that love remains love, across the years, in Jonathan Hall's 19345 Days and Sarah Hayton's Ms Diane Shackleton of Oz (formerly Kansas) contemplates life, love and dating apps.\nThe event closes with The Judy Monologues: using Judy Garland's own words and three different but coincidental versions of her, in the play the actors get inside the iconic star's head as she grapples the twin horrors of an uncooperative tape recorder and the task at hand: writing her autobiography.\nYou will need to book your own theatre ticket\nhere\n.  Tickets are £7.55 and seats are unreserved so we will be able to sit together, if you choose to.\nThere will be a\nLeisurely Walk from Shipley to Bingley\n, followed by a\ncurry in Bingley\n, the same afternoon.\nSocial events are a great way of meeting other members and finding out about other ODL events.\nIf the event is fully booked\n: join the wait list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nImage Credits: all images provided by OutdoorLads members.
