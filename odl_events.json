    "Summary": "Starting a Camino in the UK\nIt might come as a surprise, but you can undertake a Camino journey right here in the UK on a number of officially recognised routes.\nOpened in 2022 as a modern-day Camino route outside of Spain, the new 68.5 mile St James' Way between Reading and Southampton offers an option for those looking to experience a pilgrimage or journey closer to home.\nAbout this section of the route\nFor this 13.2 mile / 21.3km linear walk section, we will set off from our meeting point at the front of Reading train station and make a first stop at Reading Museum (where I will be picking up my first Camino passport stamp). We will then pass by the ruins of Reading Abbey and through the town, before joining the Kennet and Avon Canal and heading into the countryside. Upon reaching Theale, we will turn southwards towards Sheffield Bottom (where we will stop for lunch). After lunch we will head via Wokefield Common and on to Mortimer, where I will collect a second stamp at the Horse and Groom pub (and where we may want to take a near walk-end refreshment stop), before heading to our end point about one mile away at Mortimer train station. From here you will be able to make your way back to Reading and your onward journey.\nAbout the St James' Way\nThe 68.5 mile / 110km route was established by volunteers from the Cofraternity of St James and includes new signage and organised passport stamp collection points at churches and pubs along the way.\nThe terrain is mostly flat, combining countryside views with historical landmarks. Some highlights include:\nReading Abbey:\nStart at this historic site, once a significant centre for the St James cult in medieval England.\nSilchester Roman Fort:\nEnjoy expansive views while seeing the area's Roman past.\nBramley:\nVisit this pretty village to see its medieval wall paintings.\nWinchester Cathedral:\nExplore this iconic cathedral and experience the Wayfarer’s Dole at the Hospital of St Cross.\nSouthampton:\nConclude your journey at this historic port, where medieval pilgrims once set sail for Santiago.\nIf you would like to collect Camino passport stamps\nAlthough my walk is not for religious purposes, I plan to collect Camino passport stamps from churches and pubs along the way in case I decide to continue on the Camino Inglés route in Spain from A Coruña to Santiago de Compostela and want to gain a compostela or certificado. If you too are interested in collecting stamps, you can purchase pilgrim passports online at\nhttps://www.csj.org.uk/Pages/Category/memberships-and-pilgrim-records\nor at Reading Museum (but worth noting that they were out of stock when I was there a few weeks ago, so may not be available to buy on the day).\nPlease note that you are absolutely not required to purchase a Camino passport or collect stamps to take part in this walk!\nContinuing on to Santiago de Compostela\nThe requirements do change from time to time, but those wanting to continue on in future to Santiago in order to obtain a compostela (religious) or certificado (non-religious) will need to meet certain requirements; namely that pilgrims starting outside of Spain must complete a total distance of 100km and cover at least 70km in Spain on a recognised route and collect two passport stamps per day. Upon arrival in Santiago you would be required to demonstrate evidence of your UK route, hence collection of two stamps on each leg to demonstrate the journey from Reading to Southampton.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

You're in the right place, our leader will show you the ropes and you'll be climbing the crags in no time.\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Outdoor climbing is a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and get out in the fresh air.  This event will allow you to develop your climbing skills in the beauty of one of the renowned gritstone crags of the Peak District, which is our oldest National Park.\nWe will be setting up some bottom ropes at the crag for you all to use over the course of the day, similar to what you would find at an indoor climbing wall, where they are called top ropes... not confusing at all!  We will not be offering lead climbing at this event, but those who wish to practise placing gear on lead will have the chance to simulate this while being belayed on a top or bottom rope. For those who wish to lead climb we'd encourage you to consider our 'Outdoor Trad Climbing - Experienced' event.  For those who would prefer to try sport climbing outdoors, we are also offering an 'Outdoor Sports Climbing - Beginners' event.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

But you are rewarded with a lot of forest and a sense of being away from it all.\nWe'll start near the River Deben, and pass through beautiful Suffolk countryside before heading into the woods. Miles of pine forest await, as we make our way around the perimeter of an old airbase. We'll stop for lunch in a Forestry England car park where a refreshment van serves drinks and snacks for those who need them. We'll then continue our journey out of the forest, passing Gobblecock Cottage, where the forest opens up to acres of beautiful farmland.\nAs we near the end of the walk we will arrive at Sutton Hoo, the famous site of Anglo-Saxon burial mounds. We will have time to go up the viewing platform to take in the full view (all for free) but we will skip the visitor centre. We will then finish off with a final woodland walk back to where we began.\nThe day promises to deliver lovely settings, great company and tired legs! There may be an opportunity for a drink at the end of the walk for those who want to.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but they'll need to be fit and able to cope with 14 miles in their stride.

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.",

    "Summary": "This is one of a series of walks taking advantage of the main and narrow gauge trains of Wales, most of which are incredibly scenic. This walk is also one of a pair of walks this weekend in the vicinity of Porthmadog.

Alternatively contact the leader.\nOn this coastal walk we will follow the Wales Coast Path all the way from the historic port town of Portmadog, where thousands of tons of slate were once exported, to the Victorian seaside resort of Criccieth Famous for its ruined thirteenth-century castle standing proudly on a rocky headland.\nOur return journey will be aboard the Scenic Cambrian Coast line and\ncosts £3.80 pp\n.\nWe start our walk in the town of\nPorthmadog\n: Nowadays a bustling town catering for Welsh speaking locals as well as tourism, with the well known Portmerion gardens and Italianate estate nearby. There are no less than 4 railway lines serving the town - the Cambrian coast line is the 'main line' that connects the terminus of Pwlhelli with places as far afield as Birmingham, The Welsh Highland Heritage line - a little branch line with ocassionals services, The Welsh Highland Line - created in the 1980's the narrow gauge steams all the way to Caernarfon through the heart of Eryri National Park, and The Ffestiniog Railway, that carried so much slate down from the mountains. You'll see all of these as we begin our route. We will also see the famous barrage or Cobb that was built to take the steam trains across the Glaslyn Estuary. Keep an eye open for the Ospreys that spend summer nearby.... We then follow the shallow harbour that is home to yachts these days and take a footpath and back road out of town .\nThe next place we encounter is\nBoth Y Guest\n, a sleepy little beach resort with a small harbour and some very scenic coves looking back towards the mountains.\nContinuing along the beach we come to\nBlack Rock Sands\nwhich is one of the few places in the UK where you can actually drive cars onto the beach (If you don't mind getting it wet and sandy). If the tide is too high we might need to deviate inland around the rock, but otherwise it is around the corner that we will catch sight of\nCriccieth\nand its castle. The Castle was both built and destroyed by Welsh princes 200 years apart, so now its just a ruin. Depending on the speed of the group there are options at Criccieth for sea swimming (bring trunks), visiting the castle, the famous Cadwalladers Ice cream shop, Tea and Cakes or a pint in a pub. If its tight on time then we will wait till we are back in Porthmadog for tea.\nAll photos:\nAndyM, event leader.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved  and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.  Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Dogs are accepted on the train.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help, also please be sure to fill in the participation statement.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

You can be sure that everybody you meet over the weekend will be an OutdoorLad or a member of staff at the venue.\nYou can do as much or as little as you desire over the weekend (but we do advise you to get stuck in!).\nEvents\nMake sure you sign up for an event(s) over the weekend, as some may fill up fast!\nWe'll be releasing our events programme a little later on, but expect a great range of walks, parkrun, kayaking, SUP, strolls to the pub, cycling, and some great instructor-led events such as absailing, caving and high ropes - such fun!\nAll meeting points are in the sheltered area near the large yurt / bar, where you will also sign in to the event.\nFood\nContinental breakfasts, packed lunches and cooked evening meals are available to pre-order! It is important to pre-order, as there will be very few extras available to purchase over the weekend. If pre-ordering food, make sure the dietary preferences on your OutdoorLads account are correct.\nThe canteen is in the building closest to the teepees. We'll also put meals on sale nearer the time, but Friday is likely to be jacket potatoes and a range of fillings, and a hot cooked option, including veggie and vegan alternatives, on Saturday.\nThose camping are obviously welcome to cater for themselves by their tent, but will not have use of the hostel kitchens and dining areas. Please ensure that any BBQ's are raised off the grass.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs, they are not allowed on site.\nCampervans, caravans, motorhomes:\nDue to the venues restrictions, we are unable to accept campervans, caravans and motorhomes.\nImages:\nAerial shots kindly supplied by and used with permission from Will Allaway.

    "Summary": "Join us for the Sheffield LBGTQ+ climbing night, starting with a social meet-up followed by some climbing. This will be an informal event, with team member(s) of the climbing centre there to offer advice and some supervision. The cost is the standard entry fee to the centre. Informal tuition will also be able from OutdoorLads, but this is dependent on numbers.\nAnyone can join the event, but please do sign up here so we can pass numbers on to the climbing centre.\nSo.... a bit about climbing and the centre..\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form. You can pay at the centre on arrival or online beforehand. If you pay in person at the centre a small discount is available if you mention you're with ODL.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nYes! Beginners are very welcome. If you've never climbed before, just let us know by messaging the event leader or co-leader, so we can arrange for you to be signed into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try. If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely. Please note that we are limited by the climbing centre as to the number of novice climbers we can supervise, according to the number of experienced people / staff available at the event.\nDo I have to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you can answer YES to all these questions, you can climb without supervision:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nWhat other Climbing events do OutdoorLads Run?\nWe run regular indoor climbing and bouldering events across the UK. We are always keen to put more on, so if you fancy climbing in your local area contact a climbing leader and we can see what we can arrange.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by Keith\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Tucked between the hills, this narrow glen is a hidden gem filled with mossy boulders, tumbling waterfalls, and the unmistakable sound of water making its way downhill—often faster than you are.\nHalfway into the glen, keep an eye out for\nJohn Knox’s Pulpit\n, a craggy sandstone outcrop where the reformer is said to have preached in secret. Whether it’s history or Highland myth, it adds a dose of drama to the already magical surroundings.\nFrom Glen Vale, the trail takes a turn skyward, leading you on a steady 200m climb to the summit of\nBishop Hill\n. At 461m, the top offers big-sky views over\nLoch Leven\n, the patchwork of reservoirs below, and—on a clear day—stretching all the way to the\nFirth of Forth\n. It’s a great spot to stop, snack, and admire the world from a bishop-approved altitude.\nThe descent is kind to the knees, winding gently back down grassy slopes and open moorland, eventually rejoining the quiet reservoir track that loops you back to where you started.\nExpect a good variety of scenery: leafy woodland, airy hilltops, and the calming presence of water almost throughout. With a bit of history, a few climbs, and a healthy helping of scenic drama, this route is ideal for walkers looking to earn their picnic—and maybe a story or two to tell with it.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but please note and abide by the\nScottish Outdoor Access Code\n.  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nPhotos :\nTaken by event leader Marvin16\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "THIS WALK IS ON BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY\nA relaxed circular walk from Weybridge visiting Mercedes Benz World, strolling along the Wey Navigation, D’Oyly Carte Island and Thames Path, with a decent pub handily by the station at the end.\nWaitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, if you'd like to attend, please\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlace often become available closer to the date and chances are you may still get a place.\nThe route\nLeaving Weybridge station, we’ll visit Mercedes Benz World (free entry) before reaching the Wey Navigation. Along the towpath, we will pass the millpond at Coxes Lock, Weybridge Town Lock and Thames lock. We’ll join the Thames Path and visit D’Oyly Carte Island (stopping for a drink if it is dry) and walk towards Desborough Island and Walton before looping back via Broadwater Lake back to Weybridge. Whilst this is quite a suburban walk, there are relaxing stretches along the waterways.\nPlease feel free to join me at the Hand & Spear next to Weybridge station at the end of the walk. Dogs are welcome at the pub.\nhttps://www.handandspear.co.uk/food-drink/\nThe sights\nNote: No dogs are allowed in Mercedes-Benz World. This walk is not suitable for dogs unless you wait 25+ minutes outside MBW or meet us after our visit by 1200 at latest. If you make your own way to MBW: exit the station, uphill on the station access road, immediate right at the roundabout over the railway bridge and immediate right through the car park. It is signposted from the southern side of Weybridge station: 20 minutes’ walk. A description and map of that walk is here:\nhttps://www.weybridgesociety.org.uk/local-info/walks/walk-to-brooklands/\nPlease let me know if you intend to do this.\nMercedes-Benz World (free entry)\nIt’s slightly more than a car showroom. There are modest displays of vintage and F1 cars, a shop and café. Note that you won’t have time for any of the paid driving experiences today. See\nhttps://www.mercedes-benzworld.co.uk\n. Although adjacent, we will not visit Brooklands Museum which requires several hours. The building stands within the footprint of the world’s first purpose built racing circuit built in 1907.\nWey Navigation\nThe Navigation was built by 1653 for transporting goods from Guildford to the Thames at Weybridge. The advent of trains reduced its role, and it is now owned by the National Trust. We will pass Coxes Lock stopping for a picnic lunch, towering Coxes Mill (now apartments), Weybridge Town lock, some chi-chi Weybridge mansions and Thames lock before the Navigation and River Wey join the Thames at the confluence of various islands.\nRiver Thames and Broadwater Lake\nAlong the Thames, we’ll visit D’Oyly Carte private Island which was home of the theatre impresario who brought Gilbert and Sullivan together and stop for drinks if it is dry. The crocodile kept here once escaped and may have inspired JM Barrie’s Peter Pan after his visits.  We may visit the outdoor bar/café, if open. Desborough Cut was finished in 1935 and its straight channel is beloved of the rowing club. The sixth Walton Bridge was opened in 2013 with its thrust-arch, not as picturesque as the second bridge painted by Turner in 1805. Broadwater Lake is over a mile long, somewhat neglected, but was created in the 1750s in the grounds of Henry VIII’s former Oaklands Palace, once almost as grand at Hampton Court.\nWeybridge\nWeybridge is often associated with its millionaires and private gated estates. It was founded as a bridging point for pilgrims to Chertsey Abbey, and developed further with Oaklands Palace. The column which is part of the monument to the Duchess of York (who lived at Oaklands) once stood at Seven Dials before it was demolished to discourage the cut-throats and undesirables of Covent Garden from gathering there. The Hand and Spear pub is named after the family crest of the Baron of Ockham whose summer house became a hotel with the coming of the railway in 1838.\nThe route\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website).\nhttps://explore.osmaps.com/route/19412354/weybridge-loop\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs\nAs no dogs are allowed in Mercedes-Benz World, you will need to wait 25+ minutes or meet us after our visit (be there by 12). Please let me know if you intend to do this.\nThe rest of the walk is suitable for dogs with towpath, river path and pavements. There are some busy roads to cross.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Ian on this circular walk around 9 miles taking in canals and former railways.\nThe walk will start on the High Peak Trail. From the carpark we’ll walk up onto Black Rocks for stunning views towards Cromford Mills & Matlock. After descending Black Rocks it’s a steep but gradual descent down to High Peak Junction, the River Derwent and the Cromford Canal. We'll pass the Leawood Pumphouse which was built in 1849 to pump water from the River Derwent into Cromford Canal.\nIt is now well over 150 years old but remains in pristine working condition thanks to the dedication of the\nMiddleton Top and Leawood Pump Volunteer Group\n- We may see the steam engine in operation as theirs an open day being held on this date.\nWe continue along the canal and a visit to Lea Wood to see the Bluebells that carpet the woodland. From the High Peak Trail we’ll head towards Bolehill & Wirksworth, weaving our way through the beautiful Derbyshire countryside & back to the carpark at Black Rocks\nThe High Peak Trail follows the route of the former Cromford and High Peak Railway. This was one of the world's first long-distance railway lines, built between 1825 and 1830. Many important railway buildings and features can still be seen, including High Peak Junction Workshops,\nMiddleton Top Engine House\n, Hopton Tunnel and Hopton Incline.\nIn all there is around 480m of ascent, and some steep ascent/descents. The main descent is on the old railway though, which is a steady steep gradient.\nIncluding stops for lunch, snack stops, photos etc, it should take us around 6 hours.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The route offers a variety of paths through scenic countryside and peaceful woodland, making it a relaxing and enjoyable walk for all.\nBefore heading into the woods, we’ll stop at\nThe Blue Bell Inn\nfor food. If the pub is too busy, we'll find alternative options, but it's advisable to bring snacks. The walk continues through Tattershall Carr and Tattershall Thorpe Carr, ancient woodlands that were once part of RAF Woodhall Spa during WWII. Some remains of wartime structures can still be seen today, and part of the former airbase now forms Thorpe Camp, a heritage site dedicated to the history of the area.\nAs we pass through Tattershall, we’ll catch sight of the impressive Tattershall Castle, its 130-foot red-brick tower rising above the village. Built in the 1440s by Lord Cromwell, the castle is one of the finest examples of early English brickwork. Originally a defensive stronghold, it was later used as a grand residence and has been carefully restored by the National Trust. After the walk, for anyone interested there is the option to explore the castle.\nNational Trust\nmembers can visit for free, while non-members will need to pay an £11.00 entrance fee.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is at\nQueen Elizabeth’s Grammar School\n, just 9 miles (16 minutes) away.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session.

    "Summary": "We’ll make our way through shaded woodland walks (the trees will be in leaf!), alongside rivers to open moorland.\nStarting in Yelverton I’ll take you south, briefly picking up the route of the old Plymouth/Dartmoor tramway, before heading into the Meavy valley. Continuing mainly through woodland alongside the disused Plymouth/Tavistock GWR railway downstream to Hoo Meavy, passing old copper mines, signs of charcoaling platforms and long abandoned head weirs for leats to provide water power to distant mines.\nFrom Lower Goodameavy we’ll ascend an outstanding example of an inclined plane (what’s left of it), pass the disused Dewerstone granite quarries, located in lovely temperate rainforest, before continuing to rise out of the woodland to summit Dewerstone Rock itself.\nAn open moor walk of a mile or so, offering views of the south west Dartmoor tors and no doubt an encounter with some of the Dartmoor ponies, brings us to Cadover Bridge. Lunch (maybe a paddle in the river) before we set off again following the River Plym back through woodland along the line of the old china clay slurry pipeline from Lee Moor. Passing the old workings of the Shaugh Prior clay drying kilns, we’ll drop down to the confluence of the rivers where there is yet more industrial heritage.\nA short upward walk along a back-road brings us out onto the open moorland of Roborough Common with views back to the Dewerstone and across the local farmland. Now a relatively level walk across the Common brings us to Drake’s Leat and thence (perhaps after an optional call into the Skylark Inn at Clearbrook) to the Dartmoor/Plymouth tramway. From there a flat walk takes us back to Yelverton.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nPlease also be aware of the\nrules and guidance from the Dartmoor National Park Authority\non visiting the moor with your dog\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "5",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "30",
    "Summary": "When I checked out the area on a cold, bleak day in February, Chilling lived up to its name. When we stroll round the area on a lazy, hazy day in July, 'Chilling' will suggest relaxation. The only settlemen is Titchfield, far from bleak, which grew in prosperity in Georgian times as that of its Abbey dwindled, leaving the Earl of Southampton's ex-monastic mansion to be plundered for its stone. And on matters geological, the landscape is formed of Ice Age gravel outwash overlying sand, and this makes for a flat terrain which the sea and River Meon have quickly eroded. The Meon's mouth is a tiny, pretty harbour with a café, an ice cream van and a beach where we can have our lunch and a swim.\nThe sights:\nTitchfield Abbey:\nFounded in 1232 by Prémontré Abbey in France, the 'White Canons' lived a communal life observing monastic vows, farming the land, caring for the sick and preaching. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537, Henry VIII granted the abbey to his Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. The wealth of his new domain aided Wriothesley's ascent as a courtier, and he transformed the abbey into a handsome home. Wriothesley’s grandson Henry, 3rd Earl of Southampton, was a patron of Shakespeare, some of whose plays were premiered here. On the death of the 4th Earl, the abbey passed through several families, until 1781, when most of the building was demolished for building stone, leaving the gatehouse intact. It is free to enter. Nearby is Titchfield Great Barn, 48m long, in which the timbers have been dated to 1370.\nSt Peter's Church, Titchfield:\nEstablished 680, making it one of the oldest used churches in England. Though only a few parts of the original structure survive, the church contains a mixture of building styles. There is a sumptuous tomb to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, his son Henry, and grandson Henry, the patron of Shakespeare.\nTitchfield:\nLong a centre for business, with the town once having a small port. There were also tanneries, a market (in a fine market square), a fair, breweries, and craft workshops. A market hall was built in the Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early C17, but in 1970 it was bought, in a derelict state, by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. Titchfield is quite a gracious place.\nChilling and Brownwich Cliffs:\nPleistocene deposits (2.5 to 1 million years old) of gravel washed out from glaciers to the north overlies Eocene (50-40 million years old) sands and clays giving a flat relief to the area. These are unconsolidated rocks, easily eroded by the sea and rivers. The profile of the cliffs with gravel atop sand is obvious, with some disturbance of the gravel by ice wedges developing under periglacial conditions, a process called cryoturbation. Some erratics (rocks deposited by melting ice bergs) dot the beach, which are sarsen stones composed of sandstone, probably from Salisbury Plain.\nTitchfield Haven:\nThe estuary of the River Meon. The 'Visit Hampshire' website states: 'Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve is a wetland nature reserve with a rich habitat of rivers, marshlands and scrapes. It is excellent for birdwatching and attracts many people hoping to spot a rare species. From any of the eight easy-to-access viewing hides visitors can see all kinds of wildlife such as deer, foxes and wetland plants.' We will walk around the edge of the reserve, not entering it as a fee is charged, and still see many of these habitats. There is a shop, café and exhibition centre and nearby a small beach. The mouth of the Meon is controlled by lock gates and a small, pretty harbour has been created.\nTitchfield Canal:\nPossibly the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611. Close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. It was used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated although for a while Titchfield was a small inland port.\nSeawater quality:\nThe most recent bathing water quality at the bathing location was rated 'Excellent'. The water quality has always been deemed 'Good' or 'Excellent', but check\nhere\n(Environment Agency) or\nhere\n(Surfers Against Sewage).\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. Dogs are permitted on Hill Head Beach which is where we'll have lunch and a swim. Drawbacks of the walk for dogs include some roads to walk along and cross which may be busy, and summer heat which could be exhausting for them. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll go north up Mill Lane to see the abbey, then head back, using a footpath behind the recreation ground and crossing the A27 to enter Titchfield by an alleyway. We'll walk through the centre of Titchfield to Bellfield, then walk south along the canal to Great Posbrook Farm, where we'll go west along footpaths to Brownwich Lane, which will take us north to Warsash Road. After a little way walking west along this we'll reach Hook Lane and cross fields to reach the coast. At Brownwich Pond, we'll walk south to the cliff top and walk along the cliffs, using The Solent Way, to Hill Head Harbour. After lunch and swim, we'll go back and use the footpath that runs between the nature reserve and the canal all the way back to Titchfield where we'll use back streets to take us to the A27 and the car park.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Title": "SE500 Challenge: Satanic Scenery - A Devilishly Fine Walk from Jumps to Punch Bowl",
    "Date": "Saturday Jun 21 2025",
    "Region": "Unknown",
    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "1",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "24",
    "Summary": "And a quite diabolically demanding one too. This event covers two set-pieces of southwest Surrey scenery, both ascribed to Beelzebub because of their bizarre beauty: the huge wooded amphitheatre that is the Devil's Punch Bowl at Hindhead and the isolated outcrops of sandstone that are the Devil's Jumps at Churt. Surrey heathland and high-class suburbia connect the two. One extra highlight will be the decidedly un-dark, un-Satanic Barford Mill. The infernal inheritance of our Luciferan labours will be vast views, prodigious pride, cracking camaraderie and heightened health and happiness, and all gained without any pacts with the Prince of Darkness. Consult the forbidden lore below.\nSelections from the grimoire:\nBarford Mill:\nA pretty little mill on the stream that drains down Whitmoor Vale to Frensham Great Pond.\nThe Devil's Jumps:\nThree small hills, more prominent than their heights (around 120m) suggest, topped by crags of hard ironstone (sandstone). William Cobbett wrote about the Devil's Jumps in his\nRural Rides\n, first published in 1830, \"At Churt...three hills out upon the common, called the Devil's Jumps...in the shape of three rather squat sugar-loaves, along in a line upon this heath...with a rock-stone upon the top of one of them as big as a church tower.\" Back in the Jurassic Period, when layers of iron-rich greensand were laid down on a river delta, periodic floodwaters disturbed the beds, contorting them. As a result, the Jumps look to me like the ends of giant Cadbury's Flakes jutting from the ground. It was said that Mother Ludlam of Farnham (who was a witch) had her cauldron stolen by the Devil, who kicked up the hills as he made off with it.\nThe Devil's Punch Bowl and Hindhead Commons:\nThis is a large hollow of sandy heath, fringed with oak woodland and thronged with birdlife including redstart and wood warbler. Legend has it that the Devil tormented the god Thor by pelting him with enormous handfuls of earth, leaving the great ravine. In reality it was created by glacial meltwater percolating down through the sandstone until it hit an impervious layer of clay and so eroded the sandstone out. See more\nhere\n.\nWhat the Devil is SE500?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average Lowland and Hill Walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nHounds of Hell:\nThere'll be none of these on the walk, as dogs will be welcomed who are obedient and tolerant of walking along lanes and on leads when livestock are present. The walk could be exhausting for them in hot weather. Otherwise, it will be a great dog walk with abundant woodland and heathland for them to roam in.\nRoute 666\n(please click the\nlink\nto see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll follow Wey Hill west until Farnham Lane and The Avenue heading northwest to Lion Lane, where we'll leave the tarmac and cross Polecat, Craig's Wood and Nutcombe Down before using the footbridge over the A3 to Grayshott. A path along the edge of Whitmore Vale will take us to Beacon Hill and and Whitmore Vale Lane will take us to Barford Mill all the time heading northwest. At Kitts Lane, we'll turn east and follow Green Lane to Hale House Lane, then a track north to Jumps Road. After lunch on the jump and a drink at Bel and the Dragon, we'll follow Tilford Road south to Hyde Lane where a footpath will then take us from Hyde Hill to the Devil's Punch Bowl. At Coombe Head we'll go on to cross Bunch Lane down to Farnham Lane where we'll retrace our steps back to the station.\n(Image credits: The Devil's Punch Bowl, from the viewpoint: Photo ©\nMr James D\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Stony Jump, Surrey, England: Photo ©\nweesam2010 | Flickr\n(\ncc-by-nc-sa/2.0\n); Polecat Copse: Photo ©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Coniferous woodland: Photo ©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Whitmore Vale, Pondside: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bell & The Dragon, Churt: early July 2024: Photo ©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Rocky terrain atop the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View south east from the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Grazing by Highcomb Copse: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Sun and Shade at the Devil's Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Looking down on the Devil’s Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

For those arriving by car - there is plenty of free street car parking - suggest to spread out a little into nearby streets as well for courtesy to neighbours.\nThe closest train station to the meeting point is Eastleigh - about 1.3 miles away.\n**** Closer in time I will check with the Ship Inn - to see about accommodating numbers, in case of increased demand for joining this walk ****\nI've not yet done a recce, but I would estimate that the circular route will be 12-13 miles. There will be some moderate climbs.\nHeading from\nBishopstoke\n, a suburb of Eastleigh, we will cross into\nStoke Park Wood\n(part of the Ancient Forest of Bere) which was a private deer hunting ground for King Henry VIII.\nFrom here we head east to, and cross, the Portsmouth Road (B2177) where Red Lane and Hatchley Lane will take us north past Deeps Copse, Sladford's Copse, before turning left into Laybushes Copse and Austin Copse where a forest trail leads us to Owslebury.\nAtop a hill,\nOwslebury\nis on the Pilgrim's Trail from Winchester to Mont St Michel and the Monarch's Way. This leafy area during the 1830s was the scene of the Swing Riots. Across Southern England agricultural workers formed mobs and threatened to damaged machinery and property demanding money. One of the local Owlesbury farmers John Boyes took sympathy for the workers, he accompanied the mob and wrote a letter petitioning landowners to increase pay. He was tried and sentenced to transportation in Van Diemens Land (Tasmania), but he was later pardoned and returned to his farm.\nFrom Owslebury we will head south towards Colden Common, before walking through the enchanting\nUpperbarn Copse\n, back to Stoke Park Wood and our meeting point at Bishopstoke.\nDogs are welcome, but please have them under control. At some points the path is quite narrow and you may need to step aside should anyone else be passing. Be prepared you may need to call you dog to heel on occasion. From what I can see on the Ship Inn webpage it is a dog friendly pub  but please do feel free to check yourselves.\nPhotographs\nThese images are my own taken whilst doing a route recce on 12 April 25.

    "Summary": "**Please note change of date from 18 May\n**\nJoin me on this spectacular circular walk from Lewes around the South Downs. After a steepish climb near the start, the walk offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and beyond.\nWhen I led this walk in 2023, it was a very hot day, and the majority of us ran out of water. Fortunately we found a water tap in a local church yard. Hopefully it will be cooler this time, but do remember your water!\nWhat is SE500 Challenge?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nPlaces\nof interest\nLewes\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nSouth\nDowns\nNational\nPark\nThis is England's newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010, covering an area of 1,627 square kilometres (628 sq miles) and stretches for 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.\nOffham\nPronounced \"Oaf-um\", the \"new\" St. Peter's Church was built to replace the Church of Old St. Peter in 1840s. Offham hosts two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Clayton to Offham Escarpment and Offham Marshes.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\nWe leave delightful Lewes and pass over the railway line and A27 to pick up Jugg's Road (track) which we follow past the windmill at Kingston Hollow. With a steepish climb of 197m, we're graced with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the South Downs. After passing under the railway and over the A27 again, we climb Long Hill, where we'll stop for lunch, enjoying views of the surrounding countryside. We'll continue over Balmer Down and along the South Downs Way, before starting our gradual descent to the village of Offham. The walk then follows the River Ouse, and the outskirts of Lewes, climbing towards the castle before descending past The Fifteenth Century Bookshop and the quaint houses along Keere Street, and back to the station.\nPlease join me if you wish, for a drink at The Depot, next to the station.\nPlease note, the walk does not allow time to visit Lewes Castle.\nDogs\n:\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and be prepared for a couple of stiles/hills on the walk. Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nIMPORTANT\n! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Monday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nFor bouldering - absolutely!! There is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help you adjust and climb safely and effectively.\nThe main type of rope climbing on offer at this event is lead climbing, which requires those attending to have a basic understanding/introduction to Harnesses, knots and belaying first.\nSo after some consideration, we don't believe this particular event is suitable for complete beginners and we would recommend you have done your first session at one of our other events. However, if you have done\none session\nat another event and you are comfortable with climbing (or just need a refresher) please don't be put off! Sign up and let the leader know! We are still more than happy to take on climbers who are only just starting out.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

    "Summary": "Join us for a weekend camping at Nantcol Waterfalls, nestled at the foot of the Rhinog mountains.\nFar less well known than the areas in the north of the\nEryri National Park\n, the Rhinogydd are a wild range of hills in central Snowdonia that are rougher than anything else south of Scotland.The Rhinog mountains are popular with hillwalkers looking for a more isolated, wilder walking experience and we plan to put on a strenuous walk to explore these hills properly.\nIf mountains aren't for you, Cwm Nantcol has beautiful woods and spectacular waterfalls to explore, and we're also not far from the beach.\nShowers -\nthe showers operate on a shower card system which allows a 5-minute shower per card. These cards will be issued to campers at Reception.\nCampfires\n- Nantcol Waterfalls allow campfires but the site is within a Tree Preservation Area and as such we can only allow the burning of manufactured logs – the collection of deadwood and live wood is not permitted. Fires require the use of Fire Baskets only, which can be bought on site or hired from Reception. We will sort a communal fire.\nMobile signal\n- signal is weak at this site but, if you're desperate to get online, you can pay for wifi access. Alternatively, if you venture 100 metres up the hill on the same side as the waterfalls you should obtain 4 bars from most signal providers.\nDogs\n- the site permits dogs with well behaved owners. There is a charge of £4 per dog for the weekend payable on arrival to the site in cash. Dogs must be on a lead at all times when on site as this is a sheep farm - no exceptions can be made.\nMusic\n- This campsite does not allow music to be played.\nSummit area of Aran Fawddwy and view to Rhinog range\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nAndrew Hill\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/5752120\nRhinog Fawr Trig\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nRude Health\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/3358007\nRhinog Fawr\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nJohn Lucas\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4118611\nRemaining images courtesy of Bryan Cosgrove and of Nantcol Waterfalls Campsite\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as\nMonkchester\nbefore taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882.  Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. Today, the city is a major retail, commercial and cultural centre.\nThe above text is freely adapted from Wikipedia, the full Newcastle page being accessible\nhere\nWhat’s going to happen\nItinerary:\nDay 1:\nArrive late afternoon on Friday, meet & greet reception before heading off out for dinner and drinks.\nDay 2:\nA leisure\ncity morning walk\nwith local guide - (£10 - not included in event price.)\nThis is followed by an optional afternoon visit to\nthe Victoria Tunnel\n(£17.60 - also an additional cost.)\nIn the evening we will reconvene at the hostel before heading out for an evening meal. Leading onto the nightlife of Newcastle's gay scene and joining up with a local OutdoorLads members social.\nDay 3:\nSunday morning, free time before checkout - with option of a local short walk.\nAccommodation\nHostel accommodation - 2 x  6 bed ensuite rooms which will only be shared with those attending the city break.\nPlease note that unlike most of our other hostel breaks food is not provided and we will not have sole use of the hostel, however you will only be sharing a room with other OutdoorLads members.\nIs it dog friendly?\nUnless you need a guide/assistance dog, this unfortunately isn't an event for our four legged friends.\nImage credits:\nwikimedia commons and user MartieBear\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Today, on the Spring Bank Holiday, the village will be alive with celebrations.\nWe continue out of the village past Wellow Dam, a man made pond used for fishing, which is said to have been created by the monks from Rufford Abbey. The village of Wellow is also unusual as it has over 40 acres of common land, second only to Southwell in Nottinghamshire as the largest acreage of common land north of Watford. Wonderful woodland is where we'll find Cocking Moor Wood.\nOn route back to Rufford we pass the circular earthworks around Jordan Castle Farm, once the site of a moated Norman Castle; it is believed the castle was once owned by a knight called Sir Richard Foliot, whose characteristics bore great resemblance to Robin Hood's ally, Sir Richard of the Lee, who was mentioned in many ballads and ledendary tales.\nFinally, we return to the splendid site of the once Cistercian abbey, Rufford Abbey.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Standing near the summit is the National Air Traffic Control Radar, its distinctive domed structure often compared to a giant golf ball. From here, the route heads towards the small village of Rothwell, where The Blacksmith’s Arms offers a welcome stop for a drink. After Rothwell, we climb briefly, then follow the route back towards Nettleton.\nAfter the walk, there’s the opportunity to relax with a drink at The Salutation Inn, a perfect way to end the day.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is at\nMarket Rasen\n, just 9 miles (15 minutes) away.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London.\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

    "Summary": "This is one of a series of walks taking advantage of the main and narrow gauge trains of Wales, most of which are incredibly scenic.\nOn this walk we will use the service of the Holyhead to Chester main line to return to the start. We join the train at the town with the longest name in Europe and the second longest in the world. Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch.  Naturally you will want the obligatory selfie under the station name sign!\nBefore that frivolous moment the walk actually passes some very interesting scenery along the Menai straights, not least the iconic suspension bridge built by Thomas Telford; and we will cross it too. The walk initially climbs to a viewpoint looking over the town, Bangor Cathedral, the site of which which dates by to the 6C, the old University buildings and in the distance the town of Beaumaris on Yns Mon. Crossing the golf course there are some lovely mountain views. Continuing our jouney we discover the old port area which had a role to play in WW2, and then out onto Bangor Pier, to view the 'Straights. (50p Admission charge - pls bring cash). Our walk then follows the Wales coast path along a lovely tree lined stretch with the Menai Straights just below. After this we cross the famous bridge and then follow the main road to LlanfairPwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch\nThis walk is part tarmac and part trails with many uneven steps, and which may also be muddy if it rains.  We will need to keep up a reasonable pace as we have a train to catch.\nSome background info derived from Wikipedia:\nLlanfairPG\nThe long name was supposedly contrived in 1869 as an early publicity stunt to give the station the longest name of any railway station in Britain. According to Sir John Morris-Jones the name was created by a local tailor, whose name he did not confide, letting the secret die with him.  Literally translated, the long form of the name means: \"[The] church of [St.] Mary (Llanfair) [of the] pool (pwll) of the white hazels (gwyn gyll) near to [lit. \"over against\"] (go ger) the fierce whirlpool (y chwyrn drobwll) [and] the church of [St.] Tysilio (Llantysilio) of the red cave (gogo[f] goch)\". Various elements have occasionally been translated differently. In September 2015, Channel 4 News weatherman Liam Dutton went viral around the world after accurately pronouncing the name of the town in one of his weather reports. In 2024 Volkswagen used the difficult name of the village in a TV commercial as an example to show the functions of the inbuilt navigation system's AI and speech recognition.\nThe Bridges:\nIn 1826, Anglesey was connected to the rest of Wales by the construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge by Thomas Telford, and connected with London in 1850 with the building of the Britannia Bridge and the busy North Wales Coast railway line, which connected the rest of Great Britain to the ferry port of Holyhead.  Unfortunatley A fire in May 1970 caused extensive and irreparable damage to the original Britannia Bridge. The modern bridge was rebuilt in a quite different configuration, reusing the piers while employing new arches to support not one but two decks, as the new Britannia Bridge was to function as a combined road-and-rail bridge, opening fully in 1980.\nAll photos:\nAndyM, event leader.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nShorter day? New Member?\nFancy coming along to try out the group but want to go home early? This is a perfect event for new members and as we are never far from civilisation, you can head back whenever, just be sure to let the leader know so we are not wondering where you are!\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but please note his walk sometimes goes alongside busy streets and your dog needs to be well behaved and on a lead, and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.  Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Some cafes etc may not welcome dogs.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help, also please be sure to fill in the participation statement.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The walk is approximately 10 miles long.\nWe will call at The Bridestones, approximately 430m above sea level.

    "Summary": "8 miles Circular Walk\nA walk with amazing views, wildlife and history in the middle of the West Midlands! Come and see the view from the highest point in the metropolitan West Midlands, Turners Hill (271m) and it's twin Darby's Hill (270m). The views East of the Birmingham Skyline are impressive; West on a clear day Hay Bluff in the Brecon Beacons of Wales can be seen, as well as the Shropshire Hills and Malverns. The site is even included in a list of the best panorama views of the UK. You can identify what's on the horizon here:\nDarby’s Hill panorama\n.\nThis walk is surprisingly green. In what was known as the 'Black Country' for the smoke from it's industry, we walk by two green areas which were formerly quarries and clay mines, and have been totally regenerated. One is now a wildlife sanctuary.\nSheepwash Wildlife park is now home to locally rare flowers including snakeshead fritillary, cowslip and yellow bartsia. You would never guess that in the 19th century there was a clay mine, brickworks and coal shafts on this site. Read the history here:\nSheepwash history\n.\nConnecting the two are sections of canal near the Netherton Tunnel, one of the longest in the country. We have a short, exciting stretch of tunnel ourselves to reach the reserve (actually, it's a long Victorian underpass, but feels like something more!). When I checked out this walk, I saw Kingfishers by the canal. One canal is slightly higher up than the other: the canals were once so busy that Thomas Telford designed a new, straighter and broader canal, the Birmingham Navigation, which we shall follow back to the station. More details of the history are here:\nBirmingham Canal Navigation\n.\nThis walk is timed to start with the arrival of the trains as listed below. Why not park and ride into Birmingham or Wolverhampton after the event? With trains roughly every 15 minutes, take advantage of quieter Sunday free parking and take the 10-minute train ride into the city centre to enjoy the rest of your day!\nWell behaved dogs are welcome to come with you on this walk.\nWaitlist\n: If this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Pease feel free to attend and leave as an when you feel comfortable.\nThere’s a coach that runs an informal training session to teach us a few moves and techniques when it comes to problem solving on the wall.\nIf you’re new to The Climbing Hanger it’s a fantastic indoor bouldering centre with plenty of routes caves, slabs and a monstrous overhangs that will give you the PUMP your arms crave.\nCards/contactless ONLY  - this venue does not accept cash\nIf you haven't been to The Hangar before, please click\nhere\nto pre-register. Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times.

    "Summary": "Join us for a 9-mile / 15 kilometre walk on the South West Coast Path, around the Isle of Portland!\nThis circular walk begins near the Olympic Rings and circumnavigates the island in an anti-clockwise direction. The route mostly follows the official South West Coast Path.  Ascent is around 340 metres, resulting from ups and downs along the way, and with a gradual rise from Portland Bill back to the Olympic Rings.\nHighlights of the walk include:\nOutstanding views from the top of West Cliff of\nChesil Beach\nand\nFleet Lagoon\n, which is the largest tidal lagoon in Britain.\nThe extensive fortification of the\nVerne Citadel\nwhich was built in the 19th century overlooking Portland Harbour, which it was built to defend.  If you’re interested in military architecture, there’s more info\nhere\n.\nThe “\npirate graveyard\n” at the ruined old church of Saint Andrew, so-called because of the skull-and-crossbones design which can be seen on a number of tombstones.\nPulpit Rock\nand\nPortland Bill\nat the southernmost tip of the island, from where spectacular views extend to Start Point in Devon and to Durlston Head in the east.  On a clear day, you can probably see more of the English south coast than from anywhere else.\nPortland Bill Lighthouse\n, which was built by Trinity House in 1906 to guide vessels heading for Portland and Weymouth and acts as a waymark for ships navigating the English Channel.  If you’re interested in lighthouses, there's more info\nhere\n.\nNear the end of the walk, the sculpture park at\nTout Quarry\nis a showcase of modern sculptures created in an old quarry. There’s more info\nhere\n.\nWe may meet other OutdoorLads along the way who are climbing on the Portland cliffs this weekend, if so we'll stop for a chat and maybe watch them climbing for a short while.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs are welcome on the walk, but must be under close control at all times and on a lead in the vicinity of livestock or where wildlife may be disturbed.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to join us, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the event date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "While most of us in ODL are probably perfectly happy experiencing the vibrancy, opportunity and anonymity of the city, some might yearn for the calmness, spaciousness and neighbourliness of a village. If you come on this event, you'll sample the latter for one idyllic summer afternoon.\nIan Nairn, writing in\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n, briefly describes Grayswood as: \" A trim, triangular green, largely Victorian, in picturesque hilly country near the Sussex border.\" The National Open Gardens website additionally invites us to \"Visit Grayswood's gorgeous gardens - all very different, [from] informal cottage style, [to] larger more formal and varied village gardens. Visitors will have an illustrated garden trail to follow through the village [and] there will be homemade cakes and tea at the Village Hall.\" In the past there have been a display of classic cars at Grayswood garage and a plant sale.\nThere will be no set plan for visiting the 10 or so gardens and we won't go round in a big group: you're welcome to go wherever and with whomever you choose. You're also welcome to leave earlier or later, but there will be an agreed meeting place and time should you wish to depart as part of a group, perhaps to catch a particular train. In fact, you don't even need to book on this event to see the gardens of course; we'll just happily bump into you in the village! If you do come by train (or car but want a little more exercise), Haslemere Railway Station is a hour's walk from the village, so we'll have a pleasant walk through the swish suburbs and rough heaths while viewing Hindhead Common to get there. (Please see the route\nhere\n.)\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one might be suitable for them. Some gardens might admit them on leads, others might not. I'll enquire. Being Surrey I imagine that they are. They'll enjoy the walk to the village.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIf all you know of Micheldever is the railway station stranded miles from anywhere, then boy are you in for a surprise if you come on this relatively easy little walk. Once we've covered a few miles of undulating arable fields we'll reach the River Dever and the sequestered stretch of idyllic little villages, fine manor houses, ancient remote churches and vintage watercress beds that it trickles through. This is where the chief interest of the walk will lie: watching the trout skulking beneath the sparkling surface, gazing at rambling roses over cottage walls and dawdling amid weathered willow trees. A line by AE Housman springs to mind: 'On the idle hill of summer, sleepy with the flow of streams'.\nThe sights:\nWest Stratton:\nA pleasant hamlet of cob walls and timber-framed cottages.\nMicheldever\n: A moderately-sized village of black and white cottages around a road junction. St Mary's Church has a perpendicular gothic tower that leads through to a delightful octagonal nave by George Dance the Junior (architect of St Bartholomew the Less in Smithfield, and the façade of the London Guildhall) from 1806.\nStoke Charity:\nA once larger settlement but much diminished, with the church standing alone in water meadows. It was once accompanied by the manor house of the De la Charité family from whom the village took part of its name. St Mary and St Michael is a picturesque but rather plain building from the C14 and C15, but its glory is internal, as no other church in Hampshire has such a collection of medieval and later monuments. There are brasses to the Hampton and Waller families and a remarkable sculpture of the Mass of St Gregory from c1500. Michaels is a C16 timber-framed house and Old Rectory is mid-C19 neo-Tudor. Norsebury House is from 1919 by Ernest Newton, a neo-Georgian encasing of a Victorian villa, with a matching wing of 2001.\nHunton:\nA small settlement with a church alone in the water meadows. St James is a small chapel, c1500.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll walk west along the Andover Road and turn south along Weston Down Road. At Weston, we'll turn west along Winchester Road and soon pick up a footpath to Hunton where we'll take Hunton Lane. At Hunton Church, we'll take a footpath over the River Dever southeast to Stoke Charity for a possible earlier lunch. We'll then head east along Sloe Lane and follow a loop around Micheldever to have a possible later lunch and a pub stop. Footpaths and bridleways will take us east to West Stratton and a lane will take us north to Larkwhistle Farm Road which we'll walk west along back to Micheldever Railway Station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "Join Andy and OutdoorLads for invigorating\nSunday\nfrolics around the moors of Bolton.\nWell off the beaten path, we will be taking in some amazing 360 panoramic views of the North West, inlcuding Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire.  We will be visiting many historical tourist attractions and places of interest along the way.\nWe will start off across the moorland heading up to the Two Lads stone statues before heading down to the Snack Shack where we will have a well deserved coffee break. There will be opportunity to purchase hot drinks and a selection of fresh cakes/biscuits.\nOnwards to the Japanese Gardens at Rivington, where we will stop and have lunch. From here, we will climb up to Rivington Pike and admire the views from 1, 200ft, before heading up to the Winter Hill TV Mast, (to 1, 250 feet), where we will stop to admire further views before making our return journey.\nThe main points of interest on this walk include the Two Lads, tree plantation, Snack Shack, Japanese Gardens,  Aztec Bridges, Italian Gardens, The Pike, Pigeon Tower, and the TV stations.\n11 a.m. start.\nWinter Hill\nWinter Hill is the highest point in the West Pennine area and towers over Rivington and its surroundings, although it is not tall enough to be classed as a mountain. Winter Hill is really a large, raised plateau of moorland with several summits named as hills in their own right, one being Rivington Pike. There are several other notable hills including Counting Hill, Noon Hill, Crooked Edge Hill, Adam Hill, Brown Hill and more. The summit of Winter Hill itself is rather understated and tucked away at the very end of the mast road behind the smaller radio masts and is marked by an OS trig point.\nThe name Winter Hill is probably derived from Old Norse, the first recorded name for the hill being Wintyrheld which would mean literally Winter Hill. However, “winter” and its variations certainly had the meaning “wet” in the old times and therefore means “the wet hill”, rather than our modern associations of cold or snow. Colloquialisms like “winter pasture” meaning poor agricultural land, probably at one time meant wet land that could not be farmed but could be used for pasture if necessary.\nBetween those times and now, it seems Winter Hill was shown as Egberden Hill on antique maps, which would be derived from the Egbert’s Dean, which is the area now known as the Smithills Estate. The valley (dean from OE denu) reaches quite far up the hill and was once a prosperous area so passing cartographers seem to heard the place referred to as Egbert’s Dean Hill. Egbert’s Dean has a defined boundary in the SE quarter of the hill and should really refer to that area only.\nSome uphill and downhill, different terrains including grass, paths, and rocks. Possible boggy areas.\nApproximately 10 miles. Mainly flat. Good walking shoes/boots required.\nAll photos taken by the event leader\nWell-behaved, socialised and under-control dogs are welcome on this event.\nDogs must be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted and whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request. It's a good idea to check what the route may be like with the event leader before booking to find out more about the potential suitability of the walk for dogs.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "PLEASE READ ALL SECTIONS, INCLUDING WHAT TO BRING AND FOOD & DRINK\nYou can find out more about wild camping on this page:\nMy first wild camping event\n. You need to have mountain walking experience, good equipment and a good level of fitness to carry your food, sleeping bag, sleeping mat and small tent or bivvy bag for around 80 km (50 miles). We’ll walk about 20km (12.5 miles) each day. Sometimes it will be easy walking, other times we’ll be crossing parts of Dartmoor where there are no paths, rivers with no easy crossing points and rough boggy ground. The route will be partially determined by the water levels on the moor; we may need to change the route or walk late into the evenings if water levels increase. We may need to camp on exposed, wet, uneven ground.\nDartmoor has the best preserved prehistoric landscape in north western Europe. There are remains of over 5000 roundhouses, over 1500 cairns, and a remarkable set of ceremonial monuments dating from the late Neolithic to early Bronze age, including over 20\nstone circles\nand over 75\nstone rows\n. This trek visits the most impressive of these monuments. The\nfour day linear route\ncrosses Dartmoor from north to south, from\nOkehampton\nto\nIvybridge\n. Participants will need to make their own transport arrangements to the start and from the end. Trains run from Exeter St David's to Okehampton and Ivybridge. If coming by car, leaving the car in Exeter looks to be the best option (see the Location section below for details).\nOn the first day we'll visit Nine Maiden's Stone Circle, Cosdon Stone Rows (the most impressive prehistoric triple stone row in Britain), White Moor Stone Circle, Buttern Hill Stone Circle, Scorhill Stone Circle (Devon's finest stone circle) and Shovel Down Stone Rows.\nOn the second day we'll visit Fernworthy Stone Circle, Assycombe Stone Row, The Grey Wethers Stone Circles, Postbridge (shop and visitor centre), Lakehead Hill Stone Row & Cist, and Wistman's Wood (one the highest oakwoods and last remaining temperate rainforests in Britain). Depending on progress we might stop at the pub in Merrivale at the end of the day.\nOn the third day we'll visit the Merrivale Stone Rows & Stone Circle, Hart Tor Stone Rows, Down Tor Stone Row, Yellowmead Concentric Stone Circle, Ringmoor Stone Row and Brisworthy Stone Circle. On the last day we'll visit Drizzle Combe Stone Rows, Grim's Grave Cairn Circle, Erme Valley Stone Row (3.4 km long, the longest prehistoric stone row in the world) and Stalldown Stone Row.\nImage / photo credits:\nPhotos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 19 © Patrick Revell, used with permission.\nAll other photos\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n:\nPhoto 6 ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6359382\nPhoto 8 ©\nPete Cruse\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7990264\nPhoto 9 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406301\nPhoto 10 ©\nIan Capper\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7090708\nPhoto 11 ©\nVieve Forward\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6131085\nPhoto 12 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406389\nPhoto 13 and banner ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155589\nPhoto 14 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6404933\nPhoto 15 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410273\nPhoto 16 ©\nGuy Wareham\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/1911220\nPhoto 17 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6417803\nPhoto 18 ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155580\nPhoto 20 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410089\nPhoto 21 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6409234\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This will potentially knock several miles off the distance, depending on whether you decide to stay with the group as we continue along the Mersey back into the city centre. See\nlocation\nsection for information about the alternative meeting place/time.\nThe route also offers options for leaving early and using public transport to get back to the city centre, for anyone who fancies a shorter ride.\nPace & Terrain\nSpeed\n: 8 to 10 mph, always at the pace of the slowest rider—no one gets left behind. Depending on our pace, we'll be cycling for about 2.5 to 3 hours. The overall event timing is longer to allow for natural stops and starts, a quick break along the way and to enjoy a drink and maybe a bite to eat together at the end of the ride.\nRoute\n: Mostly flat with some climbs, mixing roads, trails, and riverside paths.\nTraffic\n: Some (mainly quieter) roads—riders should feel comfortable cycling alongside traffic.\nBike & Rider Prep:\nBest suited to hybrid bikes, the route is also doable on a road or mountain bike. The surfaces are mostly level/tarmac, with a cobbled section near the Albert Dock.\nEnsure your bike is in good condition (inflated tyres, working brakes, oiled chain). The ride leader cannot provide repairs.\nBring a spare inner tube,\na packed lunch\nfor the break if you want one, snacks, and water.\nWear suitable comfortable clothing. Layers including something wind/water proof are recommended.\nYou must wear a\nhelmet\nas this is one of OutdoorLads cycling participation requirements.\nWeather Conditions\nIf extreme weather is forecast, we may postpone the ride.

Along the way, we may see a few farm animals. We'll finish with an obligatory pub stop at the Queen's Head for those who want to join.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes, this walk should be suitable for dogs.

If you’re lucky enough you may spot the puffins. There are information boards and further viewing platforms at Bempton, where there’ll be an opportunity for a refreshment break at the cafe before we head back along the same route in reverse giving twice the opportunity to take photos and take in the sea views. You might want to bring a zoom camera or binoculars to get really close. I have, however, just taken the pictures here included with a regular phone camera.

Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

If you've done three or more indoor climbing events in recent history, that's about all the experience you need. If you are unsure about the difficulty of the event, or whether you have necessary skills & experience, please message the event leader.\nOn this day, we will explore some of the best climbing areas that Portland has to offer.

From there we return to Winchester along the Itchen Navigation but not before climbing St. Catherine's Hill where we can rest and enjoy the views as well as attempting the maze!\nWe'll end the walk at The Black Boy pub where we can stop for a drink - it is about a further 20 mins walk from there back to Winchester station, which I'd be happy to direct.\nAlternatively, stick around for the\nWinchester Social\nthat evening - please book separately if you'd like to attend.\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following: Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\n.\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

And yet there is plenty packed into its small area - from the dramatic stump of An Sgurr rising to 393m that we can scramble up, across the moorlands and to the Singing Sands that is Traigh a' Bhigeil.  There is plenty of history packed into the small isle with Massacre Cave to explore, a deserted township at Grulin and various ruins marking over 8000 years of people living on the land.\nBike hire is available on the island, and if the weather is kind we could hire some kayaks and get to see the island from around its coast.\nTravel info\n- don't miss this ferry, as the next departure from Mallaig to Eigg isn't until Saturday.\nBoarding of the ferry is normally completed at least 10 minutes prior to the sailing time.\nTravel is not included in the event price, you will need to book and pay for your own transport to to and from the island.\nOn\nFriday\nwe\nleave Mallaig at\n08:00\nto arrive on Eigg at 10:45\nOn\nMonday\nwe depart Eigg at 17:30 to\narrive at Mallaig at 18:50\nWhy not make an adventure of your time in the area?

We'll start by wandering through the forest before heading out onto the open hill, and climbing Ben Donich along its south-easterly ridge. There are no paths and we'll be route-finding our way up between crags and boulders. Once on the summit ridge, we'll head to the top for hopefully great views south to the Clyde, west to the islands of Argyll, and north to the Central Highlands.\nWe'll descend towards the Rest and Be Thankful - this involves following a broad airy ridge, with one boulder field to negotiate (includes one very short scramble up - involving use of hands and feet). We'll get great views of the famous mountain pass of the Rest and Be Thankful. Our route then turns down Glen Croe, and we'll walk back down the glen, with some dramatic views of Beinn Ime and the Cobbler (and all the civil engineering works currently happening to try to fix the landslides on the A83).\nThis is a fun, relatively straightforward day for anyone looking for an adventurous mountain walk.\nPhotos :\nTaken by Drookitduck\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?

This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nSpurn point is what geologists call a 'spit', formed from the movement of sand and rocks down the coast by the tide over many years. This has resulted in a peninsula jutting out into the Humber estuary offering fantastic panoramic views across the north sea, mouth of the Humber, Northern Lincolnshire and west up the Humber estuary.\nWe'll take a walk out and back along the peninsula, which is a\nYorkshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve\n. In addition to the wildlife, throughout the walk we'll see reminders of the impact that WWII had on the area (e.g. tank traps, ruins of buildings, anti-aircraft gun mountings).\nThose of you who wish can visit the Easington Lighthouse (the tallest in Northern England) if it is open on the day. Access to the ground floor is free but entry to the upper levels is £4 adult/£3 concessions.\nPlease see the website for further details\n.\nContinuing on, we'll go past the RNLI station houses and boat launch which, sadly after 213 years of sea rescues, is now\nclosed\n. Toward the end of the peninsula we'll see the ruins of Spurn Point gun batteries and other defence-related structures.\nThere is a visitor centre and cafe near the car park, which has toilet facilities.\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the parts of the reserve that we will be accessing.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

In beautiful Rosedale, the charitable Ross Foundation and world renowned artist Andy Goldsworthy have combined to restore a series of ten barns, many formerly derelict, and turn them into a mind blowing art installation. This is not about a statue, or a painting, or poetry. Prepare to be amazed.\nHanging Stones has been conceived by Goldsworthy as a single artwork – the walk between each building is as much a part of the artwork as the buildings themselves. There are no images of the artwork on this event page in order to allow for maximum WOW factor on the walk.\nIt's a beautiful walk in its own right, using paths that are not public rights of way and only available for pre-booked groups. There are streams, meadows, pockets of woodland, moorland, all under glorious June sunshine (we hope).

There are no refreshments en route, so bring food and water, but as our start time is noon, you can grab an early lunch in a cafe.\nThere is a charge for groups to access the installations (money which is used to maintain footpaths and protect natural habitats) and use otherwise private paths - hence the small fee to join this walk.\nPhotos:\nAll pictures taken by Mark Dooley or Rob Mitchell and used by OutdoorLads with permission.\nDogs\ncan be brought on this walk but must be well behaved and on a lead at all times because of the young lambs that will be around throughout the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The summit of this region is\nHalkyn Mountain\n(a mountain in name only), a site of special scientific interest and an area that has been known for hundreds of years for lead and limestone mining. Multiple limestone quarries are dominating the landscape here.\nThe journey up the mountain passes by\nBrynford Pet Cemetery and Crematorium.\nWe will stop here, have a chance to visit the café and an opportunity to look around the grounds. The cemetery is well known for being where many of North Wales pets have taken their final journey to and is visible from the nearby A55.\nAfter visiting the cemetery and working our way around Halkyn mountain, the descent back to Holywell is gradual and stays mainly to road.\nIn total, the walk is around\n11 miles\nand the course is undulating with a short moderately steep ascent up to the pet cemetery. This is the only major climb of the walk\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome. However, this is livestock country and you should know how to handle your pet around sheep, horses and cattle.

The villages of Muker, Keld and Thwaite are not too far away, and all have either a pub or a nice teashop for those cream tea lovers! Did someone mention cream tea!!\nThere are several different easy lower routes branching out in deep cut valleys, well marked tracks ascending to the higher fells and many well used paths and bridleways for a decent selection of hiking and strolling options between villages.\nThe campsite sits in a narrow part of the valley close to a flowing beck with the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast National Trails only a short stroll away.  The main camping field has a gentle slope extending from the foot of the hill slope to the farm and facilities. The ground is well drained and the grass well managed for really good pitches. A quiet path avoids the roads to either of the two close villages a fifteen minute stroll away.\nThis is limestone country with waterfalls, limestone escarpments and deep gorges & wonderful wildflower meadows that carpet the landscape.\nGreat Shunner Fell, Kisdon and Lovely Seat are the nearest high ground and the steeper slopes offer picture postcard perspectives. There is plentiful evidence of mining here especially at Gunnerside Gill and the Cow'us (stone barns) are dotted about the drystone walled enclosures dating back hundreds of years.\nThere will be a small  selection of walks each day for those who like a challenge, or a mid level wander. If you would prefer to just relax and explore this area at a slower pace you are also welcome to join us here.\nWalk/activity options will be discussed at the event briefing on Friday evening once everyone has arrived & settled in etc.\nThe campsite facilities include lockers with phone charging, modern showers and plenty of toilets in a block in the centre of the site.  The on-site shop is well stocked with local produce and handy if you’ve forgot something.\nFire pits can be hired from the on-site shop along with firewood.\nIf you chose to bring a fire pit or BBQ then these must be raised off the ground, so to not damage the ground. Open fires are not permitted!\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nCampervans, Motorhomes, caravans:\nThese are permitted at no extra cost.\nDogs:\nThe site welcomes dogs as long as they are kept under close control as the camping field is beside the working farm.\nPhotos:\nThe photos used are courtesy of event leaders Steven & Ian and OutdoorLads member Craig B and are all used with their permission.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a big day in the mountains as we complete a circuit of some of Eryri's tallest peaks, summitting six of the Carneddau's many peaks.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nYr Elen:\nAt 962m, this is the Carneddau's least visited peak, being a diversion on most classic routes. Our route takes us directly over the summit, giving us a great panorama of the rest of the Carneddau ridge.\nCarnedd Llywelyn :\nAt 1065m, this is our tallest peak and the summit of the Carneddau range; which is the highest area of upland habitat in the British Isles outside of Scotland. Due to it's vastness, the mountains are home to a large number of rare upland species, such as Hen Harriers, Ravens, Peregrine Falcons and Dotterels.\nFoel Grach:\nAt 976m, our third summit means the scabby hill, due the shattered rocks strewn over the summit. The summit also has a well built refuge, which will be a great lunch spot should the weather turn.\nCarnedd Gwenllian:\nAt 925m, out fourth hill has an interesting etymology. It's name was recently changed to be named after Gwenllian of Wales, the only daughter of the legendary Prince Llywelyn, from whom Carnedd Llywelyn gets it's name.\nBera Bach:\nAt 807m, this summit, our fifth, may be one of the most geologically interesting in the Carneddau, with rock stacks and shards shooting off in multiple directions. Scrambling to the top is good fun, provided the rocks are dry.\nDrosgl:\nAt 758m, our final summit may be the shortest, however may offer the most spectacular views. If the visibility is good we'll be able to see all along the North Wales coast and even as far as the Isle of Man.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants. If we do see them, make sure not to approach too closely, as they are wild and shouldn't be frightened.\nOther Information:\nSunday Walk:\nIf you want to make a weekend of it, come and join the Sunday walk to Aber Falls.\nAber Falls via The North Wales Pilgrim's Way | OutdoorLads\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility.

It has remarkable panoramic views from Shooters Hill and Eltham, the Crystal Palace transmitter popping up between houses, Battersea Power Station and Wembley Stadium.\nThe walk ends at the\nHorniman Museum\n.

    "Summary": "Join Paul on this leisurely bike ride from Manchester to Bolton and back.\nEveryone (including beginners) is welcome. No one will get left behind. We'll ride at a gentle pace of 8 to 10 miles per hour for about 3 hours, but the event timing is longer to allow for the natural stops and starts of the ride, plus a short lunch stop in Bolton.\nThere are frequent trains between Bolton and Manchester, so there's the option of leaving/joining the ride in Bolton if you fancy a shorter cycle of less than 2 hours. If joining us from Bolton, please book onto the event as usual, then message our ride leader Paul for details of where to meet and the approximate meeting time.\nRoute information\nStarting from Central Manchester, we will ride along National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 55 to Bolton. This follows roads with cycle lanes as far as Eccles (or there's a slightly longer off-road option along canal paths and dedicated cycle paths). We'll then use the quiet roads in the leafy suburb of Ellesmere Park to get to Monton. There we join the former Monton Green to Bolton Railway line, known as the Roe Green loop line which keeps us mainly off road until we reach the centre of Bolton.\nOur return leg continues mainly off road to NCN Route 6 and the Outwood Trail, another former railway line running between Radclliffe and Prestwich. After passing through Drinkwater Park to the outskirts of Salford, we will keep following NCN Route 6 (which has on and off road options) back to the centre of Manchester.\nAlthough most of the route is traffic free or on quieter roads, we may encounter the odd busy road. There will also be some fairly gentle climbs along the way. See the\nlocation\nsection below for a link to the proposed route map and elevation chart.\nThe terrain is best suited to hybrid or mountain bikes, though it can be done on a road bike. Some parts of the trail are uneven and can be muddy if wet. Please check that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise on the day.\nWeather Conditions\nCold, wet and windy weather conditions aren't conducive to sociable cycling, and part of the route has been known to flood after very heavy rain. So, if the weather forecast for the day indicates extreme conditions, the event may be postponed with as much notice as possible provided to participants.\nKeep in Touch\nYou can view a list of upcoming cycling events at\nCycling Events | OutdoorLads\n.

    "Summary": "Most people think that Leith Hill is the highest summit in SE England: they are wrong. It is Walbury Hill; Leith Hill's tower takes it that little bit higher, but that's cheating. Walbury Hill, on the North Downs, is on the ancient boundary of what are now Hampshire and Berkshire; as such it has several anthropic features such as barrows and more recently gallows. The near-by Inkpen Hill is the start of the Wayfarer's Walk which follows the summit of the Downs, before cutting across Hampshire to Portsmouth Island.\nOur walk will be part on the summit of the downs, but mainly on the undulating landscape to their south.  Starting near Walbury Hill, we'll head west along the Wayfarer's and the follow a pretty broad ridge south into an idyllic rural valley.  After following the valley for a short while, we climb steeply and head for the small village of Faccombe, with it's manor house (alas, not a hall) and the Jack Russell Inn. Lunch will be on the green by the duck pond, with maybe a quick call at the aforementioned inn before we head back up onto the summit of the downs. Returning to the start we'll take in Pilot  Hill - the highest in Hampshire.\nIs it dog friendly?\nWell behaved dogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and we will be walking through fields containing livestock. Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.  If you have an questions get in touch by message (I don't always see the comments).\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nImage / photo credits:\nAll leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nIf you haven't been before,\nplease fill out the Depot waiver.\nOn the day just turn up, and find one of the leaders, who will be wearing red ODL t-shirts, and they'll get you on the walls safely in no time.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nIf you've done it before and are confident to boulder without any help, please sign up\nhere\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

It\nmay\nbe possible to offer a\nlimited number\nof these spaces depending on there being sufficient independent climbers in attendance that are happy to supervise.\nIf you have less experience, but still want to give trad a go, then take a look at the\nbeginner trad session\nrunning alongside this event. Alternatively, we are also organising a\nsport climbing event\non the same day.\nEquipment\nNo equipment will be provided.\nAt a minimum you should have standard personal kit for trad:\nHarness and shoes\nHelmet (this is mandatory and you will not be allowed to participate without one)\nBelay device and locking carabiner - must be suitable for half ropes i.e. not a Gri Gri!\nNut key\nPrusik loop (for abseil backup etc.)\nLocation\nWe will meet at the car park (see below), alongside the beginner group, and choose an area of the crag depending on the ambitions of the group.\nPlease message the event leader when signing up with an idea of your experience and what additional equipment you will be bringing (racks, ropes etc.)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Dan and OutdoorLads for a quiet weekend in the North Lakes!\nNewlands Valley\nOriginally called Rogersat or Rogersyde (derived from the Old Norse “Roger-Saetr”,\nSummer pasture belonging to Roger\n)\nthe Newlands Valley is one of the most picturesque and peaceful in the Lake District, with the settlements Keskadale, Skelgill, Birk Rigg, High Snab and Uzzicar all having their name origins from early Viking settlers.\nAfter a draining of the large marshy and swampy land at the foot of the valley between Portinscale and Braithwaite in the 13th century made it usable, the more modern name of \"Newlands\" came into being.\nAlong with its natural beauty the valley is home to one of the Lakes most famous mines, Goldscope, on the lower slopes of Hindscarth, and operated from the 16th to the end of the 19th century. It yielded such large amounts of lead and copper that it was called “Gottesgab” (God's Gift) by the German miners brought over to develop the mine in its early days.\nOur accommodation\nThis great little Lake District hostel is nestled in the quiet Newlands Valley, in the shadow of Cat Bells, Hindscarth, Robinson and Dale Head. The hostel itself is compact but well equipped, with a large kitchen, large boot/drying room, three dormitories and toilet/wash facilities. There's a nice common space for us to use that will lend itself well to decent conversation and board games!\nPlease note: Attendees will need to bring their own bedding (sleeping bags and pillowcases)\nItinerary\nFriday Evening -\nArrive at the hostel from 4pm and get settled in. A buffet supplied by everyone will be our evening meal (please bring something that can feed 1-2 people, it doesn't need to be complicated), followed by a welcome briefing from the Leader.\nSaturday Day -\nA simple breakfast of cereals/toast/fruit will be available, and we will be looking to put on two, or possibly three, big walks for the day, depending on available Leaders and weather conditions. For a more relaxed day there is also the lovely town of Keswick and Derwent Water on our doorstep.\nSaturday Evening -\nPop the feet up and unwind from the day's activities. We will be putting together a two-course meal (main and dessert) to warm you all up again, followed by some games and good laughs.\nSunday -\nBreakfast is provided for once ,then we'll all band together to tidy and clean up the hostel to how we found it (takes no time at all with so many) before we need to vacate by 11am. At this point some of our number may wish to return home while others may want to enjoy another smaller walk or visit to Keswick.\nWe are very sorry, but unfortunately Stair Cottage does not accept dogs.

Heading up the newly made path running beside the road leading to the Grade I listed Stanmer House that once housed a mistress of King George. Stanmer has a church, St. Laurence, next to the pond built circa 1838 and features a donkey wheel to retrieve water from the adjacent well.\nWalking through Stanmer village we head up through Millbank Wood then Moons Wood both of which played home to secret underground demolition squads during the Second World War. These men were the last resort in dire times and would demolish railway lines and bridges if the country was invaded. Hopefully we will see a few bluebells on the way up through the woods of Stanmer.\nThe peak of our ascent is at Ditchling Beacon. The Beacon was an Iron Age hill fort and is the highest place in East Sussex commanding magnificent views across the South Downs.\nWe then head east to Black Cap our lunch stop. Black Cap also has far-reaching and impressive views, is part of National Trust land and is a nature reserve.\nDescending past Mount Harry hill, while the hill now known as Mount Harry was called Lewes Beacon, we make our way down the steep slope towards Offham pronounced \"Oaf-um\"\nCrossing the railway line and the river Ouse, Following the river into Lewes this is where out walk will end.\nWe will stop at a pub for a pint or two and you are more than welcome to join us, if not the station is a few minutes walk away.\nDogs\n: Well behaved dogs are most welcome, but must be kept under control especially where there is livestock and cattle.\nTimings:\nWhilst the leaders make all endeavours to keep the timing is accurate, it cannot be guaranteed and we may finish the event later than stated.\nNew Members welcome!\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message us, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event may become fully booked, however, if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nadd yourself to the waitlist\n, places often become available closer to the date, and chances are you may still get a place.  And no double booking!!\nAll images are the leaders.",

This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

    "Summary": "Come and explore the Waterfall Country at the heart of the Brecon Beacons. Nestled into the southern slopes of the Fforest Fawr Massif, west of Merthyr Tydfil, Waterfall Country is one of the most beautiful and popular parts of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark, with steep, tree-lined gorges and an abundance of tumbling water.\nKnown in Welsh as Coed-y-Rhaeadr (Wood of the Water), Waterfall Country lies within the triangle formed by the villages of Hirwaun, Ystradfellte, and Pontneddfechan, where old red sandstone and a long belt of outcrop limestone have created a highly distinctive environment of wooded gorges, caves, swallow holes and waterfalls.\nOur campsite for the weekend is situated on the hillside above the Afon Hepste and very close to the spectacular four best known Ystradfellte waterfalls of,  Sgwd Clun-Gwyn (Falls of the White Meadow), Sgwd Isaf Clun-Gwyn (Lower White Meadow falls),\nSgwd y Pannwr (Falls of the Woolen Washer) and the iconic Sgwd Yr Eira (Falls of Snow) where you traverse the naturally carved path behind the thunderous curtain of water.\nOn the Saturday I will be leading a 16km waterfalls walk from the campsite, taking in not only these spectacular four waterfalls, but also an additional four named waterfalls, as well as numerous cascades along the route.\nIf you don’t fancy joining us for our walk and/or want to do your own thing, there is always the option to just relax at our campsite with views overlooking the scenic Welsh countryside, or perhaps drive to one of the local attractions such as  Penderyn Distillery visitor centre (15 mins), Mountain Biking at Bike Park Wales (35 mins) or the National Showcaves Centre for Wales (25 mins).\nDogs\n: Dogs are welcome on the campsite but you will be expected to be considerate of other campers and clear up behind them.  There may be sheep in adjacent fields so please take this into account if you are thinking of bringing your dog, which will need to be under control at all times when on the site.\nCampervans, Motorhomes\n: Whilst this event is primarily a camping event, it should be possible to cater for these, but please be aware that the surrounding roads are not ideal for wider/longer vehicles.  Please message the leader to discuss.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a\nthree night\ngetaway on an island idyll and nature reserve just off Poole Harbour!\nOwned by the National Trust,\nBrownsea Island\nis just over a mile away from the mainland but will feel like a proper getaway!  We will be staying in a small bunkhouse on the island near the site of the\nfirst experimental Scout camp\nin 1907.\nWe will walk round the island looking at its sights both natural and man made (including a wildlife and wetlands centre and an abandoned village), there is also a small museum.  It isn't a huge island (just over 2 miles long and a mile wide) so this isn't going to be a weekend of long walks but there's plenty to explore as well as just enjoying being in nature and relaxing on the beach!  We could also do some stargazing in the evening as there shouldn't be much light pollution.\nDay visitors also travel to the island, but it's big enough that there are plenty of quiet places and once the last ferry of the day has gone we will only be sharing it with a group or two on the campsite and a couple of holiday cottages so it'll feel a bit like our own private island.\nThere is also a water activities centre on the island, we will look into the possibility of some water activities (optional and at additional cost) on one of the days if there is sufficient demand.\nGetting to the Island\nPlease be aware that you will need to time your arrival for this event to catch the specific ferry with the rest of our group.  More details available in the Location information. The ferry is included in the event price.\nFind out more...\nYou can read more about the island and its history on the\nNational Trust's website\nand on\nWikipedia.\nThe\nNational Trust's access leaflet\nincluding a map is also available.\nDogs\nSadly dogs are not allowed on the island nor in the hostel.  If you need to bring an assistance dog for a disability please let us know so this can be arranged.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense? Apply for a place on this event through the OutdoorLads Foundation! Nobody apart from staff members will know and we don't need lots of financial info from you either. To apply through the Foundation, you'll need to complete a very short form, which can be found along with more information\nhere\n.\nPhotos\nPhoto of the Scout commemorative stone: By I, LordHarris, CC BY-SA 3.0,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2311411\nAll other photos were taken by Neil (pacer142) with permission granted to OutdoorLads to use as necessary.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "40",
    "Summary": "Note: Please only join this event if you're happy to pay £5 to visit Lowfield Heath Windmill (pay closer to the day of the walk or on the day itself).\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\n...And other such aeolian/barometric clichés about success. The two main selling points of this walk are a private tour of Lowfield Heath Windmill, a Grade-II listed post mill of 1737, and a stretch at the end of Gatwick's runway where the planes seem to brush one's scalp as they ascend. Charlwood has over 80 listed buildings, including a church with extensive wall paintings from 1350, and central to which is a ghostly depiction of 'The Three Living and The Three Dead'. Upmarket suburbanisation and the roar of planes gaining or losing height may have erased most feeling of the past, but the views, woods and fields are charming, the low-flying planes exciting and what history remains, fascinating.\nThe sights:\nCapel:\n'One long and rather nondescript street along the [old] Worthing Road, a mixture of Weald cottages and the cheerful C19 brick of hamlets like Holmwood' (Ian Nairn:\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n). St John Baptist Church is C13, but rebuilt in 1865. Lots of good Weald farms from the C16 and C17.\nCharlwood:\n'A Weald village on the Sussex border, near Crawley New Town (and now even nearer to Gatwick...). Plenty of old cottages remain, both tile-hung and timber-framed, but the remoteness and sense of place have gone' (Nairn). St Nicholas Is Norman, with a C13 aisle and windows. Grade I-listed. Wall paintings from c.1350, which include the story of 'The Three Quick (Living) and the Three Dead' in which three proud young kings meet three skeletons as a\nmemento mori\n. A common Black Death-era trope and now quite faded. Large medieval rood screen.\nLowfield Heath Windmill:\nThe website says: 'The survival of Lowfield Heath Windmill is almost as remarkable as the story of its restoration in the hands of a dedicated and committed group of local people. The Mill was originally built at Lowfield Heath in 1737-8 and now stands on the edge of Charlwood village [it was moved when Gatwick's runways were extended]. It took thirteen years of hard work and great skill to dismantle, repair and re-erect the Mill. It has four floors, with an external staircase leading to the second floor, from where internal ladders rise to two further floors. It also has a small visitor centre within the roundhouse.' The windmill isn't normally open on the day of the walk but I have arranged with the manager for him to open it for us and provide tours in shifts during our lunchtime.\nGatwick Airport:\nThe second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow, and the eighth busiest in Europe. It covers a total area of 674 hectares (1,670 acres). 'Gatwick' was from a farm, long lost, meaning 'goat farm'. The airport opened as an aerodrome in the late 1920s, and it has been in use for commercial flights since 1933, becoming a major airport in 1958. The airport has two terminals, North Terminal and South, and a single-runway which is 3316 metres long. A subsidiary runway is available but, due to its proximity to the main one, can only be used if the main runway is not in use. In February 2025, the government announced plans to move the secondary runway by 12 m north and open it to continuous use. Planes currently take off and land alternately. Although Gatwick is reportedly one of the worst in the UK for watching planes landing and taking off, a footpath we'll follow will allow great views.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll head east from Ockley Station along Coles Lane and cross the A24 in two goes as there is a wide grassy central reservation. We'll then follow The Street to Capel church where we'll proceed along Vicarage Lane. At Temple Lane we'll turn south before turning east and using footpaths to go from Aldhurst Farm to Tanhurst Farm. At the Rusper Road we'll continue east along Duke's Road. At Boothlands Farm, we'll pick up Charlwood Lane, then Russ Hill Lane to go to the windmill for lunch. At Charlwood Church we'll veer round and follow a path south, almost to Ifield. At Ifieldwood we'll follow a path west to The Manor Farm then Langhurst Farm almost to Rusper. Capel Road and then footpaths past Lyne Farm and Pleystowe Farm will take us north back to Capel where we'll walk down Coles Lane back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them (unless the weather is really hot), but there will be some stiles, busy roads and fields with sheep and cattle. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nIMPORTANT!

You can join one of our smaller new member camps, led by some of our amazing, approachable volunteers, who'll help introduce you to others on the first evening. You'll camp together with other new members, and have use of an event shelter for socialising near your tent.\nSign up >\nChat Group\nJoin our chat group on Telegram to catch up with others attending BIG Spring Camp, arrange lift shares, share photos etc.\nOutdoorLads.events/BSC25Chat\nVolunteering\nOutdoorLads is built upon people volunteering, and BIG Spring Camp is no exception! This event's success is dependent on volunteers stepping forward to help it run.  We have our BIG Events Team, who's primary purpose of being at the event is to help out. But, we also need additional volunteers to help out with with registration, car parking, bar work, and food service / kitchen portering. Volunteering is a great way to get to know others at the event, as you'll talk to so many people throughout your shift. Once we know exactly what we need and when, we'll be asking for volunteers to come forwards.\nCampsite Information\nSite Map\nThe camp is in a fantastic spot near Betws-y-Coed in the Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, North Wales.

Gorge walking is essentially clambouring up a stream through a narrow gorge, as it flows over boulders and into pools.\nYou will end up completely wet on this event as you'll be sliding down natural water chutes, jumping into deep pools, scrambling up rocky steps and crawling through holes. Some of the gorges are barely deeper than wellington depth, others have pools that seem bottomless! Be prepared to have a lot of laughs and get very wet!\nPhotos provided by OutdoorLads Members and A Day's Adventure.",

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event is now fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nThis is a 12 mile circular walk from Pangbourne to Goring which incorporates sections of the Chilterns Way and Thames Path.\nThis walk will be the estimable\nMike Emery's\nassessment event as he endeavours to become a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader with OutdoorLads. Your support for Mike is sought.\nThe sights:\nPangbourne:\nis a riverside village in Berkshire, known for its historic charm, scenic Thames views, and literary connections to\nThe Wind in the Willows\n. Linked to Whitchurch-on-Thames by a historic toll bridge, it offers beautiful countryside walks and a tranquil atmosphere.\nPangbourne Toll Bridge:\nis a privately owned road bridge over the River Thames, linking Pangbourne (Berkshire) and Whitchurch-on-Thames (Oxfordshire). Built in 1902, it charges a toll for vehicles, while pedestrians and cyclists cross for free.\nThe Chiltern Way:\nOverall this is a 134-mile circular walking route through the scenic Chiltern Hills, featuring woodlands, hills, and picturesque villages. We will be taking the Chiltern Way for a short section.\nGoring-On-Thames:\nis an Oxfordshire village on the River Thames, known for its scenic beauty, historic charm, and access to the Chiltern Hills. It sits opposite Streatley in Berkshire, with the two villages connected by a bridge. Goring was also the home of musician George Michael until his passing on Christmas Day 2016.\nThe Thames Path:\nis a National Trail following the River Thames from its source to London. The section between Goring and Pangbourne is particularly scenic, passing through the Goring Gap, where the river cuts through the Chiltern Hills and North Wessex Downs. This stretch offers tranquil riverside views, rich wildlife, and a mix of woodland and meadows, making it a popular route for walkers.\nWhitchurch-on-Thames:\nis a charming village in Oxfordshire, located along the River Thames. It features a mix of historic cottages, a medieval church, and beautiful countryside views.\nThe route\n(see location section for OS link):\nStarting at Pangbourne Station, we will briefly walk through the village centre and then cross the River Thames over Pangbourne Bridge into Whitchurch-On-Thames. We will then head East for a while, and shortly will have a steep uphill climb to join the Chilterns Way, which we will follow along a ridge for some time, through Whitchurch Hill. As we make progress to Goring, then assuming good weather, you will have good views across the Thames Valley towards the Goring Gap. We then progress downhill and eventually arrive at Goring-On-Thames where we will walk through the village, past George Michael's house, and then have lunch on some benches by Goring Lock.\nAfter lunch we will mainly follow the Thames Path, which is one of the best sections in the area. The first part is the usual flat towpath by the river, but sometime after proceeding under Brunel's railway bridge at Gatehampton, the path follows an unusually undulating and wooded section, which rises to somewhat higher points with glimpses of the Thames through the trees, a valley section with a staircase of steps to climb (Hartley Steps) and then follows a quiet country lane back into Whitchurch-on-Thames, where we will walk through the historic village high street, with a possible pub divert, and finally cross the river back to Pangbourne Railway Station.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Difficulty & Distance": "Walk is 19km/12 miles and with a possible Thames Path divert could be slightly longer. Total ascent 211m. Terrain is mainly country lanes & footpaths, which could be muddy in part. The walk has some undulating sections with one very steep uphill climb.",

Twenty percent of the walk will be through the suburbs of Haywards Heath and not in the marvellous Maytime Wealden countryside, but eighty percent will be. The suburbs do, however, lead to the village of Lindfield 'without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex'. Beyond Lindfield is Danefield (burial place of 'Carry On' actor Peter Butterworth and his wife, the actor and impressionist Janet Brown), a tea shop at a farm, and handsome houses linked by the hedgerow-lined tracks and trails evoked in the poem above.\nThe sights:\nHaywards Heath:\nA Victorian new town started on the site of a Civil War battle in 1642 when the railway arrived in 1841. A dormitory town for commuters to London and Brighton with pleasant housing estates stretching out.\nLindfield:\nAdjoining Haywards Heath but with its own character. 'Without any doubt the finest village street in East Sussex' (Pevsner:\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n). (In 1974 relocated to West Sussex.) Around 40 ancient buildings line the high street, around half of medieval origin. 'The alternation of timber-framing and stately Georgian brick is the leitmotif' (Pevsner). Some buildings of note: Church Cottage and Thatched Cottage (C15); Old Place (1590); Lindfield House (C18); Lindfield Place (early C18)...you get the idea. St John Baptist Church is mainly c1300 with shingled broach spire and decorated gothic windows and porch. East Mascalls is a Grade II* listed manor from 1578.\nDanehill:\nNot much of a definite village centre, but a small green near the church where we can have our packed lunches. All Saints Church is 1892, by Bodley and Garner, and is serious and imposing, unlike two of its graveyard's occupants; actors Peter Butterworh (1913-1979) who appeared in most of the Carry On films from 1965 (\nCarry On Cowboy\n) to 1978 (\nCarry On Emmanuelle\n) and his wife Janet Brown (1923-2011) known for impersonating Margaret Thatcher, including in the James Bond film\nFor Your Eyes Only\n(1981). We'll have tea and cake at Heaven Farm, just outside of the village.\nThe\nroute\n(clock the link to see it)\n:\nSydney Road, West Common and Lindfield High Street will take us northeast out of town. We'll then pick up the Sussex Diamond Trail (SDT) which will take us all the way to Danehill, barring a short stretch along Church Lane. After lunch, we'll head south along Church Lane again and then the A275 to Heaven's Farm for tea and cake. The SDT and the Sussex Ouse Valley Way will take us almost back to Haywards Heath but we'll have to use Snowdrop Lane, Lyoth Lane, Gravelye Lane, Westlands Road, Hanbury Lane, Washington Road and Oatlands Avenue generally heading west, then a walk through the park, then Perrymount Road going north to get back fully.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

The aim is to reduce the vigour of bracken, which if left unchecked would smother other flora beneath it.  Without management, grass growth would be suppressed resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Bracken bashing enables flowers such as orchids and common harebells to thrive and to provide nectar sources for bees and butterflies.\nOur day will start with a safety briefing from Forestry England before we are let loose on the bracken.   We'll have a break for some lunch and after a few hours of hard work we'll find a local pub to enjoy a well deserved drink.\nAnd of course there will be cake!\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.\nAs this is a National Trust campsite, the facilities are top-notch with clean and heated showers, and your typical National Trust camp shop.\nWe've reserved a designated 'patch' in the campsite so we'll all be camping together.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome at the campsite, although please note the National Trust's\nrules for dogs as listed on this site\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nWalking from the heaths near Aldershot to the pastures near Farnham will provide contrast. Walking through millennia of history, especially military history, will provide continuity. While the colossal Wellington Monument, the Royal Garrison Church (the 'Army's Cathedral'), an inn where Cromwell stayed before a siege and the hillfort of Caesar's Camp will evoke the clash of arms, the fields of fleecy flocks will instil peace of mind. Literal high-points will be Caesar's Camp (our lunch spot) and Farnham Castle (a freebie, accessible if a masonry issue is resolved), offering stirring views, while the wealth of historic buildings (Plantagenet, Tudor, Georgian, Victorian) will display the pageant of history.\nThe sights:\nEquestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington, Aldershot:\nBy Matthew Cotes Wyatt. In 1846 the largest equestrian statue in Britain. Wellington is shown as Field Marshal astride Copenhagen. 9.1 m tall and 40 tons. It took three years and three tons of Plaster of Paris to sculpt and is made of bronze from melted French cannon. The duke sat for it, but Copenhagen had died by then, so an inferior horse was used as a model. Considered disproportionate to the Wellington Arch which it topped off (Queen Victoria thought it an eyesore too, but it couldn't be removed for fear of offending the Iron Duke), it was removed when the arch was relocated in 1882, and set up in Aldershot in 1885 at the suggestion of the Prince of Wales 'where it might be admired by the army'.\nRoyal Garrison Church of All Saints, Aldershot:\n1863, by PC Hardwick. The home church for the military personnel in Aldershot, known as the 'Army's Cathedral'. There are many memorials to regiments and personnel, and The Somme Cross, made of charred timbers from an obliterated village in the Somme. The church isn't open at weekends apart for services.\nCaesar's Camp:\nA late Bronze Age-Iron Age hill fort and Scheduled Ancient Monument of national importance for its size and completeness inside the defensive rings (it is multivallate). The rings themselves have been much disturbed by military activity and quarrying. The top is 177 m up and gives superb views across the heaths and beyond. The name reflects possible Roman re-use.\nCrondall:\nA large and attractive village originally grouped around a green. Tudor architecture abounds (such as The Plume of Feathers pub in which Cromwell stayed before the siege of Basing House in 1645), as does Georgian architecture. Powderham Castle nearby is a mere mound.\nAll Saint's Church, Crondall:\nFor Betjeman, among the finest in the county and for Simon Jenkins two stars in\nEngland's Thousand\nBest Churches\n. The high brick tower is a rarity, built in the last days of the Commonwealth in 1659. The body of the church is Norman, 12th and 13th centuries. Clerestoried (high-windowed) nave and vaulted chancel. Fine monuments and brasses inside. Parliamentarian forces camped in the churchyard.\nFarnham Castle:\nBuilt in 1138 by Henri of Blois and the home of the Bishops of Winchester for over 800 years. Demolished then rebuilt in the late 12th and early 13th centuries as a massive shell keep on the foundations of a Norman tower. In the early 15th century it was the residence of Cardinal Henry Beaufort. Since then more buildings were constructed in the grounds, the most impressive being those built by Bishop George Morley in the 17th century. The castle is free to enter and set in five acres of parkland and gardens. Positioned on a bluff, it gives fine views over Farnham and the Wey Valley. English Heritage open the Keep for free, but at the time of writing it is closed owing to crumbling masonry.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWalking through the town centre of Farnham we'll soon be at the castle for a 20-minute look around. We'll then walk across northeast the park adjacent to the castle and through the suburbs of Hale to enter the heathlands near Caesar's Camp at Hungry Hill. After crossing these heaths we'll use roads to go to the Royal Garrison Church and the Wellington Monument. We'll then cross back through the heaths, heading southwest and ascend Caesar's Camp to admire the view. After crossing Bricksbury Hill we'll be back at the A325 where a short walk along its pavement which will take us to Redlands Lane and Crondall for a pub stop. A walk through Crondall heading south over Wimble Hill, then northeast, then east along bridleways will lead to the St Swithun's Way which will head back to Farnham to conclude the walk.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nIt's tricky trying to schedule walks to coincide with seasonal displays of flowers. Even if we are too early or too late for the famed displays of wild hyacinths (better known as bluebells) that carpet the floor of Slindon Woods, there will be so much else of appeal on this walk that we shouldn't feel cheated. These include: a windmill atop a hill at with a superb view at Halnaker; the ruined priory and serene intact chancel (a church in itself) at Boxgrove; an array of handsome flint farmhouses; and the National Trust-owned village of Slindon itself. If the entire walk of 15 miles is too long for you, you could do all the best bits in just 10.5 miles, and then get a handy bus back to the starting point.\nThe sights:\nSlindon:\nA delightful brick and flint village on the southern slopes of the Downs. Only 70 metres up, but with a glorious view across the Sussex Plain to the sea. It is quite unspoilt, so much so that the National Trust has taken charge of the entire place. St Mary's church is over-restored (1866), but there is a lot of value inside. C11 nave walls and C12 chancel. Mediaeval pews. Monument to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1539), the only wooden effigy in a Sussex church and very well carved. Several fine houses of all ages all around. Nore Folly is just outside the village. A battlemented arch, built 1814, the attached summerhouse built for shooting luncheons is long gone. Grade II-listed.\nEartham:\nA tiny, unspoilt village of flint and brick in lovely countryside. Eartham House, which we might glimpse, is by Edwin Lutyens and is from 1905. Not one of his more inspired designs.\nHalnaker Windmill:\nOccupying a splendid hilltop site. Built 1750, then restored in 1934, 1955 and 2012. A squat and sturdy brick tower made elegant by an onion dome. Sweeps intact. There is also the base of a World War II HFDF ('Huff-Duff') High Frequency Directional Finding Station, and further off in the field, an ack-ack gun emplacement.\nHalnaker:\nA pleasant straggle of houses along the Roman Stane Street. Old Halnaker House is C14, now ruined, but New Halnaker House is also by Lutyens, of 1938. Very late and heavy. The grounds of the house were used as a filming location for Doctor Who in 1985 for the story\nRevelation of the Daleks,\nstanding in for the planet Necros. The Doctor and Peri ran along then climbed over a flint wall which we'll see.\nBoxgrove:\nContiguous with Halnaker and Tangmere, a small and quiet place considering the size of its church. One pretty main street of the now familiar brick, flint and tile houses. Boxgrove Common Quarry became celebrated in 1993 when the tibia and two teeth of the earliest known member of the genus\nHomo\nfound in the UK was uncovered. Back in 500,000 BC\nHomo heidelbergensis\nwas roaming a coastal shoreline that existed at the time, setting up camp and hunting and butchering horse and rhinoceros.\nBoxgrove Priory:\nThe church of St Mary and St Blaise is rather French-looking with its steeply pitched roofs and flying buttresses. Surrounded by modest monastic ruins. Before the Dissolution in 1538 the old nave, lying to the west, served as the parish church. The huge great chancel is now the parish church. The rhythm of column and vault in it is most satisfying. The delicate floral patterns were painted in the vault spaces in the mid-C16. Another treasure of the church is the De la Warre Chantry of 1532. An exquisite gothic box that takes its design from a C15 French Book of Hours. The architecture is late gothic, but the decoration is a mix of gothic and classical, even including some putti supporting the family crests. The vault is carved pendants. The church is rich in other works of art, including a reredos by George Gilbert Scott and stained glass in an Arts and Crafts style.\nAnd if you do the full walk, you'll also see:\nAldingbourne:\nIn flat cornfields, unsuburbanised and remote. Thatched cottages and the church of St Mary. This is rather fine, C12, in the Transitional Gothic-Early English style. There are two fonts, Norman and Saxon and some faint C13 wall paintings. The size of the church suggests a bigger parish and indeed it was until the Black Death caused migration from the area which was perceived as unhealthy.\nEastergate:\nLike Barnham, heavily suburbanized, but we will pass a quiet and attractive corner. The church of St George is C14 and over-restored. Manor Farm is one of the best farmhouses in the area, c1600, unrestored, half H-shaped. At the back, a big half-timber granary on staddlestones.\nThe bus:\nFor those not doing the full walk, the Stagecoach No. 500 bus leaves Tangmere every 30 minutes at 23 and 53 minutes past. It takes 15 minutes to get to Barnham Railway Station. A single ticket costs £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one is quite suitable for them despite it having considerable lane walking, a few stiles, and some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be responsive.\nThe route\n(see the shorter linear walk with bus back\nhere\n; see the full circular walk\nhere\n)\n:\nWe'll take the mixed-use path north along Barnham Lane from Barnham to Walberton, then West Walberton Lane to Fontwell. We'll use the subway under the A27 and wander through Slindon Woods. Having reached the village itself we will take Top Road briefly then a footpath west past Nore Folly. The footpath will continue west to get to Eartham. We will then cross further west to reach the A285 and take a footpath southwest then north to Halnaker Mill which is where we will have lunch. We will descend the hill, have a slight detour past Boxgrove Common and then walk along the A285 (along the pavement), to take The Street south to Boxgrove and its priory. Then using a footbridge over the A27, we will skirt round Tangmere, and some of our party can catch the bus back.\nThe rest  of the walk uses East Hampnett Lane heading east, then footpaths heading south to get to Aldingbourne. Church Road then Hook Lane heading southeast will bring us to Westergate, then footpaths heading east will bring us to Eastergate, and apart from a brief spell along Church Lane heading east, we will use footpaths all the way back to Barnham Station.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "The Isle of Wight has a character all of its own, and the rugged south of the island ('The Back') doubly so. The climate is almost subtropical, so glasshouse plants proliferate and bloom outside. The local sandstone is also distinct and so the cottages and churches look more like Dorset than Hampshire.\nThe Wee:\nThe retro Godshill Model Village, with the places we'll be seeing meticulously miniaturised.\nThe Twee:\nThe model village and the cottages orné of Shanklin Old Village - twee, but enjoyably so.\nThe Wowee:\nThe prettiest villages on the island (Godshill and Shanklin Old Village), the highest hill and best view likewise (St Boniface Down)(Plus, the 'aah factor': we'll drop in on the freebie Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary!)\nThe sights:\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary:\nThe\nwebsite\nstates:\n'\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary has 118 donkeys, 1 mule and 22 ponies, all of whom are either rescued or abandoned. They are given a ‘forever home’ in 55 acres of countryside in the Wroxall valley where they get first class care and welfare.' Admission is free but a donation is welcome.\nGodshill:\nThe show village of the island with its mellow church tower rising above immaculate thatched cottages. All Saints Church, mostly 15th-century, perched on a hilltop. Spacious interior adorned with some notable features: Medieval wall-painting of Christ on a 'lily cross' - one of only two in Europe; C18 monuments to the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe; big painting of\nDaniel in the Lions' Den\n, perhaps by Rubens.\nGodshill Model Village\n:\nThe tourist traps of Godshill and Shanklin Old Village reproduced at 1/10th scale. 'You can find all of our houses, cottages, churches and pubs in real life for a proper Gulliver [or Godzilla (Godshilla?)-suited] experience! Our models are fantastic replicas of these real buildings, made with sand and cement so they weather as they age. We even thatch them just like the real thing' (the website). The abundant conifers, trimmed to maintain scale, are equally notable. £7.00 to enter. We'll take the recommended 45 minutes to explore it over lunch, but if it's not your thing, you're welcome to go to the pub or explore the village and miss this quintessentially English piece of quirkiness.\nAppuldurcombe House:\nThe shell of a large and very fine C18 baroque mansion, built 1702-1740 for the Worsley family by John James. Requisitioned by the military and bombed by enemy action in 1943 and left a ruin. Managed by English Heritage. Freemantle Arch, 1770s, perhaps by James Wyatt. We won't be entering the house, just seeing the exterior.\nSt Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down:\nChalk hills rising to 241 metres, the island's highest point, In 1940 the radar station was bombed by Stukas, a scene reconstructed in the film\nThe Battle of Britain\n. Ecologically a rare juxtaposition of calcareous downland and acid grassland-heathland with acid-loving gorse, heather, bell heather and bilberry meeting alkaline-loving juniper and box. The cap of gravel supports a forest of holm oak. The views, south to the sea and north over the island to the mainland are truly stupendous.\nShanklin:\nA popular seaside resort with an esplanade lined with hotels and cafes and a sandy beach occupying a broad bay. The pier was lost in a storm in 1987.\nShanklin Old Village:\nA picturesque cluster of old cottages and Victorian cottages ornés, mostly now cafes, restaurants and touristy shops.\nShanklin Chine\n:\n'Chine' is a local term for a coastal ravine. Shanklin Chine contains waterfalls, trees and lush vegetation, with footpaths and walkways allowing access. Red squirrels are being supported and a section of PLUTO (PipeLine Under The Ocean), installed to supply petrol for the D-Day Landings, is visible. The Chine costs £8.50 to enter and doing so is optional.\nIsland Line Railway:\nNewly refurbished London Underground Class 484 trains (converted from D-78 stock) serve on the Island Line network. These replaced the 82-year-old Class 483 trains from 1938 that served on the island for 32 years until 2020.\nWightlink catamarans:\nHSC Wight Ryder I\nand\nHSC Wight Ryder II\nare high-speed craft in service from 2009. The sun deck makes the sea crossing great fun.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to the Ordnance Survey website to see the ascents and descents):\nShanklin's streets will soon give way to countryside via a converted railway line out to Lower Hyde and beyond. At Winstone Farm we'll leave the old railway and head west to the Donkey Sanctuary. Hitting the Stenbury Trail, we'll go into Godshill where we'll have just over an hour to see the model village and church and have lunch. Footpaths and the Worsley Trail will take us south and east out of Godshill to Appuldurcombe House. Footpaths and Rew Lane will then take us to Wroxall Down via Homelands Pit Farm. We'll cross Wroxall Down out to the antennae and then descend St Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down, heading towards the sea and finally reach Shanklin where an option is to descend Shanklin Chine before returning to the station to go back to Ryde.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on all my walks and this walk has plenty of open countryside and few lanes. However, it is quite long and hilly and may be too demanding for them in hot weather. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join me on a spring walk from the town where I work, Ryde, to my home town of Newport. Meandering through the streets of Ryde until we reach country lanes and disused railway lines - long turned into cycle paths and bridleways - and make our way into Newport.\nThe day will start with “a ticket to Ryde\", taking the Wighlink Fast Cat service from Portsmouth Harbour over to Ryde Pier Head on the Isle of Wight. Once we have docked we will make our way down the recently converted Victorian Tramway, which is now used as a walk way to the shoreline.\nAt the Esplanade we will begin to head east, heading through the back streets of Ryde until we reach the lanes, and bridle paths which link the Victorian seaside town of Ryde with the ferry port of  Fishbourne.\nEn route we will have lunch at Quarr Abbey, a 19th century abbey which along with the surrounding farm is worked by a small group of Benedictine monks. Situated not far from the ruins of the former abbey, which was demolished under the Dissolution of Monasteries Act of 1536. In the grounds there is a very well stocked shop featuring local produce, and a cafe which does good food, and more, importantly coffee and cakes. There is plenty of room to eat a packed lunch on benches around the grounds, and chill while watching the locals feed the abbey's pigs and seemingly endless supply of piglets.\nAfter lunch we will continue on a slight southwest trajectory, heading through Fishbourne, and Wooton (passing the Postal Museum which I didn’t even know existed until I started walking home from work) until we reach Island Harbour. A small marina which is mainly filled with private leisure boats. Rather oddly sitting in an enviable position by the marina, with great views down the River Medina, is the bus from Spice Girls: the Movie, which could make an interesting photo opportunity (and no I haven’t seen that movie either…).\nPassing through the marina we will walk along a bicycle path which runs parallel to the River Medina, and leads us to my home town of Newport. In Newport there should be ample time for a swift half before taking a bus from Newport back to Ryde, or to head straight to Ryde and have a drink there . I aim to get you back to Ryde in plenty of time to catch the 18.45 Fast Cat sailing to Portsmouth Harbour.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them with few stiles and busy roads, but there may be a number of fields with livestock.

Situated just to the North West of the City of Bristol, it is easily accessible from M5 Junction 17 and 18.\nCommencing from the car park, we walk across to the 18th century Blaise Castle House Museum, the home of the social history collection.  We then walk down to Stratford Mill and follow the tree lined limestone gorge of Hazel Brook, along which you will find Tarn Lake and Penny Well.  Hazel Brook then joins into the River Trym at Coombe Dingle, and we continue to follow the course of the river through a mix of woodland and grass meadows down to where it meets the River Avon.\nFrom here the route follows the Avon for a short distance before walking along the southern edge of Shirehampton Golf course (be alert for shouts of FOUR!), before heading into the grounds of Kings Weston House, towards Penpole Point.  Travelling back towards the Blaise Castle estate we will lunch beside the 18th century grade 1 listed Kings Weston House, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1712 who also designed Blenheim Palace.  There is a coffee shop here, where you can get yourself a drink or ice cream.\nThe final leg of today’s walk takes us past two follies.  The first of which is at the top of the Kings Weston estate, then passing through hill top limestone meadows and along to an Iron Age hill fort we get to grade II listed 18th century Blaise Castle folly, built by Robert Mylne in 1766 for wealthy Bristol merchant Thomas Farr, which featured in Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey.  The Blaise castle estate was also the backdrop for the village of Avalon in the 2023 Arthurian drama The Winter King.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "1",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "49",
    "Summary": "Racier, but also shorter and linear. A rehash of a walk from last Good Friday, but now with more of the famous racecourse. Partly townscape but mostly landscape, the townscape is that of Chichester, a cathedral city of Georgian townhouses, and the landscape is that of the rolling South Downs National Park. We'll go surprisingly deep into the national park and the vistas we'll enjoy will go even deeper. In Chichester, we'll follow a half-circuit of the Roman city walls with views over the historic centre. In the countryside we'll see chalk streams and flint-built villages, and at lunchtime we'll sit on an Iron Age hill fort and survey views across the Weald, across 'Glorious Goodwood', and across the coastal plain.\nThe sights:\nChichester:\nA cathedral city of Roman origin (Noviomagus Reginorum) founded soon after the Claudian invasion of 43 AD. Many Georgian buildings and a thriving arts scene. The chief sights are:\nBishop's Palace Gardens:\nextensive and intricate Tudor gardens overlooking the cathedral;\n'Dutch-style' roundabout:\nOnly Britain's third, where cyclists and pedestrians have priority;\nCity walls:\nOriginally Roman, c200 AD, four metres wide and five metres high in places. 80 per cent complete, making them the most intact circuit of Roman town defences in Southern England;\nChichester Cathedral:\nFundamentally Norman, but modest and friendly in scale. C12 and C13 rebuilds creating beautiful transitional Gothic chancel and retrochoir. Unique but clunky detached bell tower of 1436. Tower and spire (82 m tall) accurately rebuilt in 1861 after collapse by George Gilbert Scott. Interior is almost a gallery of modern art (the cathedral exterior will be seen at a slight distance; we won't be entering);\nChichester Festival Theatre:\nBy Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, 1962, grade II*-listed. Innovative open stage and hexagonal plan. Park location to foster informality and festivity.\nEast Lavant:\nBeside the river with a lovely intricate yet relaxed plan. Brick, flint and thatched cottages and a superb view north to the Downs. St Mary's Church is 12th and 13th century, with a plain brick tower of 1671 and all the rest a Victorian restoration of 1863. We could have a drink at The Royal Oak.\nSt Roche's Hill and the Trundle:\n206 m in elevation. The Trundle (Old English 'Tryndel' or 'circle') is an Iron Age hill fort built around a Neolithic causewayed enclosure. Subsequent history involves a chapel to St Roche (lost), a Civil War encampment and a viewing area to Goodwood Racecourse. There are wonderful views to be had, north over the Weald and south over the Sussex Plain and the Sea.\nGoodwood:\nWe won't see the late C18 stately home and we'll only see the aerodrome, car racing circuit and site of the Goodwood Revival at a distance, but we'll get a grandstand view of the grandstands of the famous racecourse. 'Glorious Goodwood' earned its honorific by being 180m up, and set in sublime countryside. It was laid out in 1801 as a private military racecourse. The current stands are the March Stand of 1980, the Charlton Stand of 1989 and the Sussex Stand of 1990, the latter by Arup Associates. Architect Michael Hopkins designed the paddock area with tent-like structures in 2001. Edward VII called Goodwood 'a garden party with some racing tacked on', and I think the festive feel and beautiful setting confirm his belief.\nCharlton:\nA quadrilateral of lanes lined with flint cottages. Apart from Fox Hall which was built by Lord Burlington (architect of Chiswick House) in 1730 as a hunting lodge for the Charlton Hunt, there are no houses worth special notice and no church. The village is still very pleasant in its setting among wooded hillslopes. It played the fictional Scottish village of Tulloch Moor in the Fourth Doctor Who classic story\nTerror of the Zygons\n. The Fox Goes Free pub (then The Fox Inn) was the base of UNIT operations, and Sarah-Jane Smith and the UNIT soldiers chased the Zygon Harry Sullivan along its lanes until the creature fell from a hayloft on to the pitchfork it was wielding.\nSingleton:\nA tangle of lanes with no special houses, but very pleasant nonetheless. Beautifully maintained. St John the Evangelist church has a Saxon tower and very tall Norman walls, but the details are C13.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link to see the walk at the OS website):\nLeaving the station we will walk around the southwest, northwest and northeast quadrants of the city walls, mostly on the elevated walk promenade, occasionally at street level. We will then descend the walls and cross the Oaklands Way Ring Road to walk past the Festival Theatre. Beyond that Centurion Way cycle path will take us out of the town into the countryside to East Lavant. We'll take the West Sussex Literary Trail to The Trundle. After lunch, we'll descend the hill and take the Monarch's Way alongside the racecourse. Chalk Lane track will take us to Charlton and we'll follow the River Lavant and Charlton Road to Singleton to pick up the bus.\nThe bus journey back\nThe Stagecoach No. 60 bus takes 20 minutes to go from Singleton to Chichester and departs at 21 and 51 minutes past. A single fare is £3 and contactless payment is encouraged.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, although there will be lots of road walking in town and may be some fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nThis event is fully booked, however, if you'd like to attend,\nadd yourself to the waitlist\n, places often become available closer to the date, and chances are you may still get a place.\nThe western tip of the Isle of Wight is almost an island in itself. The River Yar, which rises a stone's throw from formerly fashionable Freshwater Bay to the south and wends its way to pretty, yachty Yarmouth to the north, nearly parts the peninsula from the rest of the island. West Wight is famed for its dramatic coastline: the chalk cliffs of the southern side seem insuperable until they disintegrate into the jagged fragments of The Needles, while on the northern side, the chalk gives way to the showy, slumping sands of Alum Bay and its beach (accessible by steps or chairlift). West Wight is dotted with forts which will add interest and variety to the beauty of this holiday-in-a-day day walk.\nThe sights:\nYarmouth:\nA small seaside market town, Saxon in origin but with a Norman grid road layout. Yarmouth Castle, built in 1547 by Henry VIII, is a gun platform to defend The Solent. The elegant Town Hall was rebuilt in 1763. In St James' Church there is a monument to the C17 admiral Sir Robert Holmes. He obtained it in a raid on a French ship, when he seized an unfinished statue of Louis XIV of France and forced the sculptor to finish it with his own head rather than the king's. Yarmouth Pier (Grade II-listed), opened 1876, is the longest timber pier in England (186m). You might like to explore the town more thoroughly at the end of the walk; it really is a lovely little place.\nRiver Yar (Western Yar):\nRising a few hundred metres north of the beach at Freshwater Bay, this runs north to Yarmouth. Freshwater Marshes and Afton Marshes are Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Coastal erosion has removed the headwaters of the river and further erosion could eventually cut off its source, turning the river valley into a sea channel and West Wight into an island.\nFreshwater:\nA scattered village which enjoyed some popularity as a Victorian seaside resort (The Albion Hotel is typical) and attracted residents such as the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson and the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Overlooking Freshwater Bay is Fort Redoubt, built in 1855 to guard against a French invasion.\nFreshwater Bay:\nFamous for its geology and rock formations. The bedding planes of the chalk are noticeable, with each one delineated by bands of flint. Arch Rock collapsed in 1992. Stag Rock is so named because a stag leaped on to the rock from the cliff to escape during a hunt. Mermaid Rock became detached from the cliff face in 1968.\nTennyson Down:\nA grassy ridge of chalk rising to 147m above sea level. Named after Lord Tennyson who lived at nearby Farringford House for nearly 40 years. The poet used to walk on the down almost every day. The monument, a Cornish granite Celtic cross, is by JL Pearson, and dates from 1897, five years after Tennsyon's death.\nThe Needles:\nA row of three chalk sea stacks rising 30m out of the sea. The 35m Needles Lighthouse was built in 1859. The adjacent waters and seabed form part of The Needles Marine Conservation Zone. The formation takes its name from a needle-shaped pillar called Lot's Wife which collapsed in 1764. The remaining rocks are not needle-like, but the name has stuck. The Needles were considered by the BBC's\nSeven Natural Wonders\none of the wonders of Southern England.\nThe Needles Batteries and Rocket-Testing Facility:\nTwo heavy gun emplacements built above The Needles to guard The Solent. Old Battery was built in 1861-2, New in 1895 when the Old Battery's cliffs crumbled. In the 1950s the battery was used for testing the Blue Streak missile, as well as the Black Knight and Black Arrow satellite launch vehicles. The rocket testing facilities are a scheduled monument.\nAlum Bay:\nA classic sequence of upper Paleocene and Eocene (65-44 mya) beds of soft sands and clays, up against the Cretaceous chalk (100-65 mya). The formation would have been the UK's example of the famous K-T boundary that represented and evidenced the end of the dinosaurs and the Mesozoic Era, but the crucial layer containing the iridium from the asteroid impact in Yucatan, Mexico, was eroded away prior to further sedimentation. The sands are coloured by oxidised iron compounds. On the clifftop there is an amusement park and a chair lift takes tourists to and from the beach below. Alternatively, a footpath leads to the beach via Alum Bay Chine (we could take either, time permitting). A traditional souvenir of Alum Bay were ornaments containing layers of the coloured sands. In the past visitors could dig out the sand themselves but the removal of sand is now prohibited.\nFort Albert:\nA tower fort under the cliffs south-west of Yarmouth, built in 1856 as a defence against French invasion and inspired by American defences, but obsolete by 1858. Now Grade II*-listed and privately owned as flats.\nDogs:\nI welcome dogs on my walks and this walk is perhaps suitable for them, although there are sections along the cliff tops which are not fenced and dogs should be kept well away from the edges, and exposure in hot sun may be hazardous. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it):\nA stroll south along Yarmouth's Market Street and St James' Street will lead out of the town to where we'll pick up the bridleway that was the railway line to Freshwater along the River Yar. At Freshwater old church we'll pick up the Freshwater Way through Afton Marshes. We'll then reach the coast at Freshwater Bay and ascend the hill, following the Tennyson Trail west to the cliffs above The Needles. Then, turning east and then north we'll head along the coastal path to Alum Chine (time and stamina may allow a descent to the beach at Alum Bay). We'll then bear east, cross Headon Warren and mostly walk along the seafront, and always on the coastal path, past Totland, Colwell and Norton back to cross the Yar Bridge back into Yarmouth.\n(Photo credits: Alum Bay and the white cliffs of West High Down: Photo ©\nChris Gunns\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Needles, Isle of Wight; Photo ©\nChristine Matthews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Quayside and car ferry, Yarmouth: Photo ©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth Harbour: Photo ©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: Market Square: Photo ©\nMichael Garlick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: The Old House: Photo ©\nChris Downer\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Yarmouth: Market Square: Photo ©\nLewis Clarke\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Western Yar at full tide Photo ©\nPaul Coueslant\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Freshwater Bay, Stag Rock and Mermaid Rock: Photo ©\nChris Gunns\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Tennyson Monument, Totland, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nPeter Trimming\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); High Down: Photo ©\nAnne Burgess\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Alum Bay, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nChristine Matthews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); On Headon Warren, Isle of Wight: Photo ©\nRobin Drayton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beach at Linstone Chine: Photo ©\nKurseong Carl\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Fort Albert, Cliff's End, Colwell bay, Isle of Wight - 2: Photo ©\nTerry Robinson\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Beach at low tide, east of Round Tower Point: Photo ©\nJim Champion\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Looking along the beach towards Yarmouth: Photo ©\nSteve Daniels\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). Photo of The Needles by\nMypix\n, licensed under\nCC BY-SA4.0\n.

The garden was designed as a series of living paintings in the 18th Century and winding paths through the 158 acres will bring us to stunning viewpoints and fascinating garden buildings including a Crystal Grotto, Gothic Tower, Ruined Abbey, Temple of Bacchus, and Turkish Tent.\nPainshill has also been the setting for feature films such as Dorian Gray and 101 Dalmations, TV productions ranging from Bridgerton to Married at First Sight UK, and music videos for Ellie Goulding, Florence & The Machine and Jessie Ware.\nOur walk from Cobham & Stoke d’Abernon train station to Painshill will largely be through countryside and along quiet lanes with far reaching views. We pass Cobham Park and Bramble Wood together with the pretty village of Downside where we shall see the small church (St Michael’s Chapel) overlooking the village green.\nOnce we arrive at Painshill, the historic route around the garden is approximately 3 miles and includes a mix of made and unmade paths.  There are some spectacular views across the Vineyard and from the Gothic Tower plus plenty of birdlife to see around the Serpentine Lake. At the far end of the landscape is the Gothic Tower which you can climb to find views across four counties.\nOur route back from Painshill to the train station will be different (shorter) and will pass through Cobham town centre, urban paths, and suburban areas. If you would like a drink before heading home, the Italian Coffee House is right next to the train station or the Old Plough pub on station road is a 5 min walk away.\nEntrance fee to Painshill\nPainshill prefers visitors to book in advance online and it is also cheaper to do so - the standard price is £12.50 (£15.00 on the door). Book an arrival slot of between 12 noon and 1pm.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before...\nAs above, everyone attending the event must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement.

    "Summary": "Returning to one of OutdoorLads' favourite bunkhouses in a remote part of Northumberland for THREE nights, this will be a get away from it all weekend. This is a Friday to Monday trip!\nOur venue is located 4 miles from the nearest public road, deep into the Cheviots, along the College Valley. It lies less than 1/2 mile from the Scottish border, sandwiched between the border ridge and the Cheviot (815m).\nIt is surrounded by beautifully rounded Northumberland Hills, close to the northern end of the Pennine Way, with deep, wild valleys, and dramatic gullies created at the end of the last ice age.\nThis will be a remote, away-from-it-all weekend, where phone signals and wi-fi are unlikely, which is a magical chance to connect with OutdoorLads pals and the spectacular scenery that surrounds us. We'll spend two days getting out and exploring on foot - walks are necessarily going to involve some steep climbs and there are no \"gentle\" options - but you'll be rewarded for your efforts with spectacular views!\nThe evenings will be filled with hearty, home-cooked meals, and socialising with fellow OutdoorLads - board games and star gazing are likely to be high on the list of evening entertainment. It will be a fantastic weekend of comradery, great food, and genuinely getting out more!\nThe Hills\nThe\nCheviot Hills\nare a range of rolling hills straddling the Scottish Border with Northumberland. The English section is within the Northumberland National Park. The range includes The Cheviot (the highest hill), plus Hedgehope Hill, Windy Gyle, Cushat Law and Bloodybush Edge.\nThe hills are sometimes considered a part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland as they adjoin the uplands to the north. Since the Pennine Way runs through the region, the hills are also considered a part of the northern Pennines although they are separated from the Cheviot Hills by the Tyne Gap, part of which lies within the southern extent of the Northumberland National Park.\nSome of the gems are in between the hills.\nHen Hole\nis one such place and it makes a wonderful route to the top of the Cheviot from the Hostel. It was created at the end of the last ice age, by meltwater, creating a deep gully with waterfalls, leading up to an amazing basin underneath the Cheviot summit. With some very easy scrambles, it makes a fantastic route to highest point in this whole range of hills.\nWildlife in the College Valley (not that we're guaranteed to see it all!)\nThe valley is well known for its population of\nferal goats\nand is home to around 150. Rumour has it that they were released in medieval times by the monks on Holy Island. This primitive British breed would have died out completely if they hadn't escaped into the wild. As farming changed there was a swing to foreign breeds which produced more milk. The goats can often be seen on the Newton Tors along the eastern side of the Valley. However they can pop up in the most unexpected of places! Over the years many goats have been re-homed to help manage environments elsewhere in the UK and this has helped to ease the pressure on local vegetation.\nRoe deer\nare present throughout the valley. Whilst they are beautiful they also bring their own challenges with damage to trees so their numbers are carefully managed.\nThe valley has a healthy population of\nred squirrels\n. Hazelnuts are a great source of proteins for the squirrels. With care and quiet you could be lucky and see one of these lovely little mammals.\nAdders\n, Britain's only venomous reptile are also present in the valley.\nSlow worms\n, which are really burrowing limbless lizards (commonly mistaken for snakes) are also common. They have been granted protected status along with all other native British reptiles.\nOtters\nare present along the College and Lambden burns.\nThere is a good population of\nrabbits\n,\nhares\n,\nvoles\n,\nfox\n,\nstoat\nand\nweasels\n. These can be seen throughout the valley.\nCollege Valley Estate has spent a lot of time and effort reintroducing\nblack grouse\n, a marvellous bird at risk of imminent extinction in the UK. Black grouse UK, part of the UK Biodiversity plan, is dedicated to reversing this trend towards extinction. In 1995 the Wilderness above Mounthooly was planted with over 55000 broadleaves. This became the largest new native woodland in England. Black grouse were initially quite successful but bad weather has affected recent breeding seasons and numbers have declined.\nThere is a healthy and well managed population of\nred grouse\non all the heather areas in the valley; shooting for these remarkable birds provides a significant income for the estate. The sound of them telling one to 'go-back, go-back, go-back' is one of the sounds of wilderness areas.\nDogs\n.

Based in or near Manchester, you’ll learn when and how to move a casualty, how to deal with major illnesses and injuries, administering CPR and managing someone who is unresponsive.\nThe course is perfect for anyone spending time in the outdoors whether you’re a keen hillwalker or outdoor professional. If you find yourself in an environment where emergency medical assistance could be more than 30 minutes away, these outdoor first aid skills are essential.\nCourses are delivered in a friendly, relaxed manner by experienced outdoor professionals. We keep medical jargon to a minimum with the focus being on practical, active learning. We believe the best way to learn is by ‘doing’ and not by sitting in a classroom with a notebook listening to someone talk at you. Where weather conditions allow, much of the course is taught in the outdoors … exactly where you’d expect to use your new found skills.\nThe qualification meets the Outdoor First Aid Band 3 requirements set by the\nInstitute for Outdoor Learning\nand is ideal for those with outdoor instructor qualifications such as Mountain Leader, Rock Climbing Instructor, Paddlesports Instructor, etc.\nOver the two days, we’ll cover a range of outdoor first aid topics including:\nResuscitation\nCasualty monitoring\nPrimary survey/secondary assessment\nIncident management\nScene survey\nSummoning assistance\nFirst aid equipment\nBones, joints and muscle injuries\nMajor illnesses\nBurns\nWounds and bleeding\nCatastrophic bleeding control\nExtreme heat and cold\nRespiratory disorders\nPoisoning\nHead and spinal injuries\nAnaphylaxis\nEye injuries\nHypovolaemic shock\nBites and stings\nChest and abdominal injuries\nLeaders from anywhere can attend these events, you don't have to live in the same region.\nEvent cost\nTo help us ensure that those that book on to this event are committed to it, we're asking Leaders to pay £15. This payment will be refunded in full once attendance on the course is confirmed after the event. If you cancel before the event and we can fill your place, you will be refunded in full, but otherwise your booking on this event is subject to the\nOutdoorLads refund policy\n.\nPhotos\n: Provided by hellosimon and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement, here\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The vague gap on the map at the centre of Dorset is where the little town of Middleton (Milton) once stood. It had grown up in the middle ages beside the magnificent abbey and was big enough to hold a market. The town was demolished by the 1st Earl of Dorchester between 1771 and 1790 and the abbey, saved for the town at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, was turned into his private chapel adjacent to his fine new house. His tenants were rehoused a mile away in a model village called Milton Abbas, of uniform thatched white cottages which is rather delightful (to us at least).\nThe main town street now lies under the cricket green of Milton Abbey School which is what his house became. All in all, 'the sweep of the church, William Chambers' house and Capability Brown's grounds, set in a glade amid wooded slopes, is one of the great set pieces of English landscape' (Simon Jenkins:\nEngland's Thousand Best Churches\n).\nThe church itself is probably the most impressive in Dorset. It is mainly fourteenth century, enlarged after a fire in 1309 but the Lady Chapel was lost at the dissolution and the nave was never finished. Another fine church also occurs on this walk at Hilton, which has medieval paintings of the twelve apostles and a very picturesque setting in a wooded valley above thatched roofs.\nThe route (see it\nhere\n) will also lead round to the village of Milbourne St Andrew which is a cluster of red brick and cob (clay and straw) cottages on the Dorchester-Blandford Road. The route will then return to the quiet gravel and grassy trackways over fine Dorset downland and woodland with which it began before it completes its circuit back at Milton Abbas.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following: Please ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Thank you.\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event is now fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nA wander from St Paul’s taking in Smithfield meat market and Clerkenwell, visiting The Charterhouse Museum/Chapel, Order of St John Gatehouse Museum and Barbican estate.\nWe should also be able to explore St Bartholomew the Great church and hidden gardens and squares north of St Paul’s Cathedral around Farringdon and Clerkenwell.\nThere will be time for a quick lunch (around 30 minutes), and probably drinks at the end.\nPlease note that all sights/museums have free entry. You may wish to give a donation to the museums and churches we visit as we will not be taking the paid/pre-booked tours.\nThe sights\nWe won’t be guided around each place, but will have time to explore and meet up at the end of each visit to move on, and I will introduce each sight.\nSt Bartholomew the Great church\nhttps://www.greatstbarts.com/visit\nThis is the oldest surviving church in the City from Norman times. It oozes atmosphere, but was also the setting for Charles’s non wedding to “Duckface” in Four Weddings and a Funeral. There is Damien Hirst’s brutal reminder of the grisly end of St Bartholomew (he was skinned alive) and a more picturesque half timbered gatehouse. Ironically, it stands next to St Bart’s Hospital and the well known execution site at Smithfield and its meat market (1327 to likely closure in 2028).\nOrder of St John and Gatehouse Museum\nhttps://museumstjohn.org.uk\nNow best known for St John’s Ambulance, the military Order of St John was founded in Jerusalem and established the priory in Clerkenwell. We will visit the museum at St John’s Gatehouse (free entry). Please note we will not visit the church, crypt and historic rooms which are only seen on a pre-booked paid tour.\nThe Charterhouse Museum and Chapel\nhttps://thecharterhouse.org/explore-the-charterhouse/\nThe Charterhouse (almshouse) is still home to the religious Brothers, having been established as a monastery in 1348 as well as founding Charterhouse school (now in Surrey). We will visit the museum and Chapel (free entry), which were opened to the public in 2017 for the first time. Please note that we will not take the paid organised tour of the grounds/other buildings.\nBarbican Estate\nThe Barbican is now Grade 2 listed and the 2000 flat estate arose from the ruins of bombed London, with the arts centre opening in 1982. I will take you on an exploration of the Brutalist architecture and the terraces.\nNew Members\nNew members are very welcome. Please message me if you have any questions or concerns before the day. Whilst we are a very open and welcoming group, if you wish, we may be able to organise an existing member to buddy up with you before or on the day. Do also feel free to arrive early as I’m always around much earlier than the start time.\nDogs\nSorry, no dogs are permitted at these sights.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "IMPORTANT - The K2B is now full so we cannot accept any more signups at least for now.\nGot a New Year's resolution to take on a new challenge?  Fancying something to train for to get fit?  Or just a bit mad and like walking a long way in some beautiful Lakeland scenery?\nWell, this event could be for you - the Keswick to Barrow Challenge is back for 2025!\nWhat is it?\nWell, it's a very long walk - approximately 40 miles from just outside Keswick to Barrow-in-Furness with about 2000m of climb (spread out over a long way - it's not a mountain walk, don't worry!)\nBut it's more than that...\nIt's a charity fundraiser - we'll be collecting sponsorship to split between OutdoorLads and other charities nominated by the K2B Foundation who organise the event as well as the costs of running the event.\nIt's a massive achievement  - when you cross the finish line you'll feel amazing (and maybe think about doing it again next year?)\nIt's a huge event - with teams from all over the country, both smaller ones like ours and from big companies, fundraising for all manner of different charities.\nCan I actually do that?\nIt might be a long way - but as a bit of a veteran of quite a few endurance events your leader has every confidence!  You will want to do some training, though, few people can manage this sort of thing without.  Unsurprisingly the best form of training for walking is more walking...so why not sign up for some ODL walks and build up your distance!  There's no need to do super-long distances in training, though, just plenty of walking and be sure to try out any kit you're planning on using on the day.\nThe team\nThere's a minimum team size of 4 for the event (but we can enter more and we hope we will!) - however that's more for administrative reasons and we don't have to walk together throughout the event, so whether you're an accomplished ultramarathon runner and reckon you'll get round in 5 hours, or whether you're a walker who'd rather enjoy the scenery and take all day, it's all good.  If people do want to walk together that's also great, though, and we can provide each other some support along the way - there'll be plenty of time to talk about things like that on the run-up to the event.  Either way, you'll never be on your own with the hundreds of others taking part!\nAccommodation\nIf you live locally and can get dropped off at the start at the crack of dawn you don't necessarily need accommodation.  However for the rest of us we typically look at accommodation for the weekend in Barrow so there isn't far to go at the end of the walk (you'll probably not be in a fit state to drive anywhere!).  In previous years the Premier Inn (where your leader is staying) and Travelodge have offered good options but there's lots available so you can pick somewhere that suits your budget etc.  Don't book Saturday breakfast - you'll be up and out far too early for that :)\nWe usually meet up for a meal and a drink or two on the Friday early evening before a reasonably early night before the walk (and some walk related admin e.g. giving numbers out) - likely this will be near the Premier Inn but we can work that out depending on where people are staying.\nGetting to the start\nThe organisers provide what they call a \"Happy Bus\" coach service from many of the Barrow hotels to get you to the start - this leaves in the early hours of Saturday morning (3-4am!) which might be where the name came from (er!) - this is bookable at a small charge later on.  You can also have someone drop you off at the start if you have someone to do that but there is no parking available there so we do recommend the bus.  There isn't a bus the other way which is why we tend to stay in Barrow (also it tends to be a lot cheaper than Keswick for hotels etc).\nFundraising\nEach walker needs to raise £80 to take part in the event as a minimum, which is to be donated via the K2B website and not other sites e.g. JustGiving.  You'll get a personalised link to raise sponsorship which you can send out to as many people as possible to help reach your target!\nSounds great - how do I sign up?\nThere are a few things you'll need to do to get signed up:\nRegister an account on the K2B website at the below link and message the leader your Member ID so I can add you to the team when it has been set up.  If you already have a registration from previous years you can use the same one, you don't need to create a new one.\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/user/register\nSign up to this event page.\nOnce I've confirmed we have a minimum team of 4 signed up, book accommodation (this is at your own cost).  As prices can and do go up as the event approaches, it might be worth doing this sooner if there are suitable refundable options.  The leader is staying in the Premier Inn in Barrow but there are plenty of other options if that's not to your taste.  Don't book Saturday breakfast as you'll be leaving way too early for that!\nWhen looking for accommodation note the bus pickups are really early (around 3-4am).  The event buses do serve places other than Barrow itself but you'd need to get yourself from Barrow back to those places after the walk.\nNote that if we only have 4 and someone drops out that doesn't stop us walking - we just need a minimum of 4 signed up to confirm the team.\n(Provisional bus information:\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/happy-buses\n)\nYou will then need to pay your entry fee which is £15, and book your bus seat at £10.\nOnce we have the team all set up you'll be able to start collecting sponsorship via your own page on the K2B website - good luck!\nRemember there is a minimum commitment to raise £80 to be allowed to walk\n- this is the K2B's rule, not ours - so start in plenty of time :)\nDogs\nDogs are allowed on the K2B event itself BUT are not allowed on the event buses nor in most hotels, so if you intend to bring one (make sure it can walk 40 miles!) you will need to check arrangements carefully and arrange your own transport to the start (noting again that it's drop-off only, no parking is allowed anywhere near the start).  Dogs are allowed on the field at the finish but must be on a lead.\nObviously assistance dogs are allowed should you require one for a disability but please let the leader know if you are bringing an assistance dog so I can let the organisers know.\nPhoto credits\nThe photos on this event page were taken by previous participants/leaders including Danny McKeown-Henshall and are used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. Bring along something to feed one or two people, and home-cooked is always preferred.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge or dining room.\nEaster Saturday\nOn Easter Saturday, we'll be looking at a range of activities you can sign up for.\nFree Activity:\nThere will be a hike arranged in the local area for those who want to explore.\nPaid Activities:\nKayaking/Canoeing/SUP\nCaving\nEaster Sunday\nEaster Sunday we'll have options of:\nFree Activity:\nA gentle walk from the Centre along the coastal path to Berry Head, where we might bump into the Abseilers (see below)  and then onwards to Man Sands. where, if the weather is good, you can spend the rest of the afternoon relaxing.\nPaid Activities\nCoasteering\nAlternatively, Paignton is the home of\nSplashdown Quaywest\n- one of the largest waterparks in the UK and home of 'The Devils Drop', 'The Screamer' and 'Wild Kamikaze' water slides.  So, if you want you can head there for the afternoon.  It's about a 15 min drive to Splashdown Quaywest from Brixham.\nEaster Monday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nGroup Chat\nWant to chat with everyone else coming in advance to help arrange lifts or plan the welcome buffet spread?\nClick here to join the Group Chat for the weekend\nCar Sharing\nIf driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way.\nSign Up Here\n!\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington. Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn.\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1:\nPublic Domain\n; Image 2-4: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 5: Bridlington Sea Front\n© Nicholas Hutton and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n.",

We skirt the top of the\nForest of Bowland\n, perhaps making a quick side trip to see the\nGreat Stone of Fourstones\n, before stopping for a pub lunch in Clapham or\nSettle\n.\nAny coast-to-coast route is going to involve some hills.  The good news is that the Way of the Roses is much kinder than many routes.  However, the climb out of Settle is crazy steep . . . and cobbled.  But it’s also pretty short; the main action is over in half a mile, after which you can take in the views of the Yorkshire Dales.\nWe head further east through the Dales before finishing up in Grassington, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n84km (52 miles) with 1,200 (3,609ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as a lot of the distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n.\n**\nYou will need to carry all your kit and book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in and around Grassington.  Skip plans to stay at the Old Hall Inn in Threshfield (1.5km outside Grassington).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should any arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1, 4, 5 and 6: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 2: First Way of the Roses Waymarker ©\nAntiquary\nand licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; Image 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL.",

    "Summary": "Introduction:\nLast year it was an Isle of Wight Double. This year it's an all-new Dorset (plus a bit of Devon) Double, taking place on the Saturday and Sunday of the late-May Bank Holiday weekend. Campsites and B&Bs might be a little hard to find later on and expensive as the late May Bank Holiday weekend is at the start of the half-term holiday, so you are advised to book right now. Demand for the Double Event may be reduced as Big Spring Camp will be running at the same time, but even so, I hope you can come and experience a double-bill of outstanding coastal walks on the Jurassic Coast, centred on Lyme Regis, the 'Pearl of Dorset', a place equipped with an array of B&Bs and campsites.\nSchedule:\nDay 1 (Saturday 24 May): Seaton and Beer to Lyme Regis and Charmouth\n- linear walk with bus from Lyme Regis/Charmouth to the starting point at Seaton.\nDay 2 (Sunday 25 May): Lyme Regis and Charmouth to Whitchurch Canonicorum, Ryall and Golden Cap - circular walk.\nPublic transport to Lyme Regis and Charmouth:\nRail:\nThe nearest railway station is Axminster, which is served by hourly direct services from London Waterloo on a journey lasting 2 hours, 42 minutes.\nLocal buses:\nBuses from Axminster Railway Station to Lyme Regis and Charmouth depart at 15 minutes past the hour (except at 16.25 and 17.20). The last service is 18.15, but they could run later in peak season. They take 25-30 minutes to get to Lyme Regis and Charmouth respectively and go near the campsites. I will confirm these details closer to the event.\nAccommodation:\nBook for at least\nFriday 23 May to Sunday 25 May\n(3 nights). The following day is Bank Holiday Monday.\nYou are advised to book now\nif you can.\n(By way of a disclaimer, I don't know what any of these sites are like; they're just in the vicinity.)\nCampsites:\nChoose one near Charmouth, such as\nCummins Farm\n. There is also\nManor Farm\nwhich does caravans and chalets too. If you want to stay in Uplyme (which is outside of Lyme Regis, and is a little far out of town), try\nHook Farm\n. I reckon Cummins Farm is best for traditional, basic camping.\nCaravans, glampers and pods sites:\nNewlands Farm\nand\nWood Farm\n. These sites are both in Charmouth, have extensive facilities, but are family-oriented.\nB&Bs:\nChoose one in, or within a mile of, Lyme Regis or Charmouth. Search Booking.com\nhere\n.\nDay 2 - Lyme Regis to Golden Cap:\nThis is a circular walk that spends a little more time inland before returning to the majesty of the coastline. Those staying in Lyme Regis will get extra distance to cover, but with the benefit of a walk along the shore where abundant fossils may be found. There will be three main ascents: the first is Hardown Hill, which is an Iron Age hillfort; the second is Golden Cap, which is the highest point on the south coast at 191 metres; the third is merely a hill outside Charmouth. All three points will offer magnificent views over land and over sea. In addition, there will be some lovely little villages such as Whitchurch Canonicorum, whose church contains the only intact saints’ reliquary in England.\nDay 2 - the sights:\nCharmouth:\nA picturesque coastal village known for its stunning Jurassic Coast scenery and rich fossil-hunting opportunities. Its origins go back to Roman times. During the Saxon period, it was known as 'Cernmunde' and the village witnessed fierce Viking battles in the C9. It grew into a small medieval market town, benefiting from its location on ancient trade routes. Its cliffs, part of the UNESCO Jurassic Coast, are famous for fossils, attracting naturalists since the C19. It is now suburbanised but retains its charm.\nWhitchurch Canonicorum:\nA picturesque village in Marshwood Vale, renowned for its historic church, St. Candida and Holy Cross, which contains the only church shrine in Britain to have survived the Reformation with its relics intact, those of St Candida (St Wite), a Christian martyred by the Danes, or alternatively a West Saxon anchoress (a female religious recluse). (Westminster Abbey also contains a saint's relics, those of Edward the Confessor.)\nRyall:\nA pleasant hamlet nestled in Marshwood Vale. Surrounded by rolling hills and lush countryside, it offers superb views. Known for its close-knit community and rural charm.\nHardown Hill and Hillfort:\nIts prominence of over 150m qualifies it as one of Dorset's four Marilyns and it is listed as one of the 'top 12 Dorset views to take your breath away' by Dorset's official tourist website, with expansive views over the Marshwood Vale. The hillfort (Iron Age, spanning approximately 800 BCE to 43 CE) features earthen ramparts and ditches, though much is eroded.\nGolden Cap:\nThe highest point on the southern coast of England, rising 191 meters (627 feet). Composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily sandstone, limestone and shale, it forms part of the cliffs that showcase the region's rich geological history. Part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its geological importance. The site provides stunning panoramic views, and its distinctive golden-hued cliffs are a popular destination for hikers, geologists, and nature enthusiasts alike.\nFossil hunting:\nThe area is renowned for its abundance of fossils (exposed as we'll be passing at low tide) due to its unique geology and ongoing coastal erosion. Key reasons include:\nJurassic Period Rocks: The cliffs around Charmouth are composed of sedimentary rocks, primarily shale and limestone, formed around 200 million years ago during the Jurassic period. These rocks preserve a wide range of marine life from this era.\nContinual Erosion: Natural erosion caused by waves, wind, and rain constantly exposes new fossil layers, making fossils accessible on the beach.\nVariety of Fossils: The area was a marine environment during the Jurassic, so it contains numerous fossils of ammonites, belemnites, ichthyosaurs, and other ancient marine creatures.\nSoft Mudstones: The clay-rich Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone formations are relatively soft, allowing fossils to be easily revealed and extracted without extensive excavation.\nDay 2 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThose staying in Lyme Regis will start at The Square and walk along the coast to Charmouth (the tide will be low). We'll ascend Lower Sea Lane and pick up the guys staying in Charmouth. We'll then head east along The Street and Berne Lane and cross the A35, continuing on Berne Lane as far as Whitchurch Canonicorum, where we'll follow Lower Street, then Higher Street to Ryall. We'll then make our first ascent: up Hardown Hillfort. We'll then take footpaths to the A35 and over Muddyford Lane to ascend Golden Cap. The South West Coast Path (SWCP) will return us to Charmouth, and those staying in Lyme Regis can continue back on foot (along the shore or using the SWCP) or by bus.\nBe assured that I will be reconnoitering this route to check that it works!\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but some of it is under trees so will be cooler. Your dog must be responsive if it is off the lead.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Search Booking.com\nhere\n.\nDay 1 - Seaton and Beer to Lyme Regis and Charmouth:\nThe first of our daywalks is linear and contrasts a genteel seaside town with a quaint fishing village, and combines tangled woodlands with rugged cliffs. The bus will pick up some of our party in Charmouth, then the rest of us in Lyme Regis before its goes to Seaton over the border in Devon to deposit us for the walk to begin. We'll head to Beer, have coffee (or beer) there, then head to Seaton for a stroll on the prom. Crossing the River Axe we'll follow the crumpled and crumbling coastline from the safe distance of the South West Coast Path, glimpsing the sea through the trees. We'll finish in Lyme Regis overlooking The Cobb and those staying in Charmouth can continue on foot or take the bus.\nDay 1 - the sights:\nBeer:\nA delightful fishing village in East Devon. Its name is not derived from the drink but from the Old English word\nbearu\n, meaning 'grove', referring to the surrounding forest. It is situated in a smugglers' cove, and caves were once used to store contraband goods. Beer Stone has long been prized because of its workability for carving and for its gentle yellow colour. Quarrying, fishing and lace production were the sources of income until tourism and model railways developed (Peco, founded 1946, has its head office and factory in the village.)\nSeaton:\nA seaside town and fishing harbour with an attractive promenade. The town was small and centred around fishing and farming until the arrival of the railway (now a preserved tramway) in 1868 when it became a resort. Many of the buildings are Victorian, but it also has notable buildings from the 1930s.\nBeer to Seaton Cliffs:\nTo the east of Seaton are the red-coloured cliffs of Triassic age rocks, capped by younger rocks (Cretaceous) of the greensand. The Seaton Fault, which is visible at Seaton Hole at the western end of the beach, allows the chalk into the sequence which runs to Beer Head.\nAxmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff: '\nA sheltered wooded wilderness...situated on one of the most active coastal landslide systems in Western Europe with a band of folds and troughs constantly evolving and being shaped and reshaped by landslips [where greensand rocks slump on soft] clay. The Undercliff has a reputation for being the closest thing you’ll get to a rainforest in the UK with a warm and humid microclimate nurturing a carpet of ferns, fungi, wild clematis and orchids beneath a dense leafy canopy...It’s also home to a variety of birds and wildlife including ravens, peregrine falcons and owls as well as reptiles and amphibians such as grass snake, common lizard and great crested newt...One of the many highlights of the route is Goat Island, famous for being the first ever scientifically described and recorded landslip...The landslip became very famous and was visited by Queen Victoria.' (From the 'Love Lyme Regis'\nwebsite\n.)\nJurassic Coast:\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, crucial for its rich geological history spanning 185 million years. Its cliffs reveal layers from the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, offering insights into Earth's past. Renowned for fossils, it attracts scientists, educators, and tourists, blending natural beauty with historical significance.\nLyme Regis:\n'The Pearl of Dorset' is a gorgeous seaside town. Visitors can explore its quaint streets lined with independent shops, galleries, and restaurants and holidaymakers can enjoy its sandy beach. Dating back to Saxon times, its name derived from the River Lim. Granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1284, it became 'Regis' (of the King) and thrived as a port. The Cobb, a huge sea wall, first constructed in the C13, supported the town’s maritime trade. Lyme Regis played a role in significant events, including the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685. The town gained fame for its connections to paleontology, particularly through Mary Anning’s discoveries of fossil plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs in the C19. Lyme Regis has inspired film and literature, most notably in Jane Austen’s\nPersuasion\n, where the Cobb sets pivotal scenes. John Fowles’\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\nportrays the town, with the Cobb central to the novel and its 1981 film adaptation with Meryl Streep.\nDay 1 - the\nroute\n(click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey site)\n:\nThe bus will drop us at the western end of Seaton Esplanade where we'll take the inland branch of the South West Coast Path (SWCP) and follow Beer Road, Old Beer Road and New Road to Beer. After time to explore Beer, we'll meet up by the bay, and pick up the coastal branch of the SWCP back to Seaton and walk along Seaton seafront. We'll then cross the River Axe and using Squire's Lane, ascend the hills and clifftops that will take us all the way back to Lyme Regis. We'll emerge at the point that the Cobb attaches to the land. Members can explore Lyme Regis or take the bus back to Charmouth if they need.\nBe assured that I will be reconnoitering this route and the transport logistics to check that they work!\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this one may be suitable for dogs with lots of stamina. It is long, has some fields with livestock and will partly be along lanes. Some of the route is exposed to the sun so a dog may overheat, but much of it is under trees so will be cooler.

 Should you wish to stay in town you can:\nExplore the island on your own.  Options in Kardamena include hiring a scooter (from €45 per day), quad bike (from €85 per day), stand-up paddleboard ( €20 for 60 minutes) or a jet ski (€60 for 15 minutes).  Consider parasailing (€60 for 10 minutes), or grab your passport, go to Kos Town and sail 20 minutes across the strait to Bodrum, Turkey (roughly €20-€40 return).  Or just spend the entire day on the beach drinking Greek coffee and enjoying the sun!\nAll participants must not engage in any activity which is likely to compromise their safety or the safety of any other person.\nOutdoorLads accepts no liability for any activities booked independently.\nFor those that want to get out and explore, we can enjoy this little \"\nleg-stretcher\n\" hike of just under 9km, starting right in Kardamena.  A flat start along the beach leads to a 20% uphill grade at about 4.5km to beautiful views back toward town.  From the turning point there is a short, steep (18%) downhill grade crossing scrubland back into town.  We will return in plenty of time for the afternoon at the beach, before enjoying a wonderul dinner back at Mina's.\nYou will need water and snacks which we can get at one of the shops along the beach.\n04 May:\nAfter yesterday's free day, we tackle a\n16.5km\nhike from the beach up to Plaka Forest, along the airport ring road and back down to the beach.\nThe forest of Plaka is full of tall pines, cooling streams and dozens of freely roaming peacocks!  Oh and a few stray cats to keep everyone in line!\nAs with yesterday, food, water and snacks will need to be brought along.\n05 May:\nAs this is meant to be a relaxing week, today is another free day!  There are plenty of options for short hikes around the area if we are so inclined, but there are also pools, waterparks and more beaches!\n06 May:\nThis morning we will board the 09.30 \"Captain Dimitris\" from Kardamena harbour for the 20 minute crossing to Nisyros (roughly €20 return) and the harbour town of Mandraki.  From the dock we will hike up to the\nEvaggelistria Monastery\nand back (the linked map only shows the return route, but it will be \"up and back\").\nWe will need to be back at the dock no later than 16.00 to catch the last ferry back.  This shouldn't be too much of a problem, as the hike is about 8km round trip.\n07 May:\nSomeone has a birthday today so we will come up with a special way to celebrate!!!  More details will be posted here as we get closer to the day.\n08 May - Departure Day (for some)\nSadly for some of us the Greek adventure comes to an end today.  Transfers to the airport will be arranged accordingly.\nHowever as most departing flights are late evening we will come up with an activity for everyone.\n09 May - Departure Day (for others)\nAs with yesterday, transfers to the airport will be arranged according to your flight departure time (allowing plenty of time for Customs clearance and last minute shopping.\nShould you wish to stay longer on this island paradise I can provide Mina's contact details privately.  The \"official\" ODL event will end on Thursday 08 May.\nIMPORTANT!

    "Summary": "Gosaikunda Trek and Raft Expedition\nOur Gosaikunda trekking and rafting expedition offers a little bit of everything Nepal has to offer neatly packaged into a two week expedition. We will trek off the beaten track for seven days from the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley into the stunning Langtang region of Nepal.\nThe trek starts at Sundarija just a short drive from Kathmandu. It enters the mountains through the Shivapuri National Park before crossing the Lauribina pass at 4,610m. This the site of the sacred Gosaikunda lakes; a Hindu pilgrimage site linked to Shiva’s trident.\nWe descend from Gosaikunda to the next phase of the expedition on the Trisuli river which is a 4-hour drive from the end of the trek.. We spend two days rafting on the Trisuli river and then travel to Chitwan National Park. Here it is possible to see elephants, crocodiles, rhino and perhaps a tiger. After two nights in Chitwan we fly back to Kathmandu on an internal flight.\nOutdoorLads has organised this expedition to see the most thrilling locations Nepal has to offer with minimal time spent on long bus journeys. It offers a chance to get off the beaten track and really get to know Nepal.\nOur trip organizer (and OutdoorLads Member) Nick Read, is a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs Pride Expeditions.  He has led an OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and 2017 and a raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012. The last trek and raft trip in Nepal ran in November 2018 with a large group from OutdoorLads and was loved by all who took part. It created memories and friends that will be treasured for many years.\nITINERARY\nDay 1 Sunday 2nd November 2025\nArrival in Kathmandu (at anytime you want)\nToday you will be welcomed at the airport and transferred to your accommodation in Kathmandu approximately half an hour’s drive from the airport.

In the afternoon we will go for a canoe safari on the Chitwan river and see crocodiles and hopefully some rhinos and elephants.

You will have time for some last minute souvenir shopping and afterward, we will have a farewell dinner in Thamel.\nDay 13 Friday 14th November 2025\nToday is a spare day to allow you to rest and relax and see a bit of Kathmandu visiting some of the temples or just relaxing after a busy trip.\nDay 14 Saturday 15th November 2025\nYou’ll be transferred back to the airport according to your flight schedule.

You'll learn what you need to know to sail the ship.\nThis is not a leisure holiday! Voyages aboard CatZero are interactive, fun and rewarding. You'll be living in very close proximity with the rest of team, and working together throughout the five days. There will be long days and maybe nights!
