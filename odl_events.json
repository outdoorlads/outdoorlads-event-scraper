    "Summary": "Join us for the Sheffield LBGTQ+ climbing night, starting with a social meet-up followed by some climbing. This will be an informal event, with team member(s) of the climbing centre there to offer advice and some supervision. The cost is the standard entry fee to the centre. Informal tuition will also be able from OutdoorLads, but this is dependent on numbers.\nAnyone can join the event, but please do sign up here so we can pass numbers on to the climbing centre.\nSo.... a bit about climbing and the centre..\nClimbing is a total body workout. It is not just about strength, but requires balance, problem solving and planning. Climbing routes are like puzzles that might need some breaking down, planning or practice. Indoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills.\nAwesome Walls Sheffield was the first climbing centre to be awarded ‘National Performance Centre’ status by the British Mountaineering Council. They provide the biggest climbing walls encompassing the widest variety of angles and styles of climbs. With grades for all abilities any climber will enjoy the routes here. It is also a great place to start climbing, so if you want to take the step into the world of climbing this is the place to try it.\nTo come along, please book on to this event and also register with Awesome Walls Sheffield if you have not done so before (\nhttps://www.awesomewalls.co.uk/sheffield-registration/)\nPlease choose the 'mixed use' form.

    "Summary": "This event is a 3-night midweek retreat! (During half-term for many people.)\nNestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.   We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.  This will be the third time we've used this fantastic, intimate venue.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nThis event is a 3-night midweek retreat!  Rich will be leading mountain walks on both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The walks will be decided based on weather closer to the time, along with the ability of the group, and availability of any other leaders coming or nearby.  This is a great opportunity to practice or contribute to route planning, if you would like to get involved.\nIf you don't fancy the mountains both days, then other options include: lowland walks (without a leader), trips to nearby Keswick, Grasmere and smaller villages, or hang around the house reading!\nMonday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event. Tuesday and Wednesday nights will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table, so expect a lot of street food / finger food!  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories!  Conversation and community will be key to a great weekend.  The mountaineering club have a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great few days of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.  From memory, the hut has wifi.\nParking is (frankly) a nightmare due to the cottage's location.  It is much easier to park in the village and walk down.  There is room for 4 cars, however Rich will need one space to unload the food.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Fylde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A circular walk with a grand centre piece:\nMentmore Towers, historically known simply as \"Mentmore\", is a 19th-century English country house built between 1852 and 1854 for the Rothschild family in the village of Mentmore in Buckinghamshire. Sir Joseph Paxton and his son-in-law, George Henry Stokes, designed the building in the 19th-century revival of late 16th and early 17th-century Elizabethan and Jacobean styles called Jacobethan. The house was designed for the banker and collector of fine art Baron Mayer de Rothschild as a country home, and as a display case for his collection of fine art. The mansion has been described as one of the greatest houses of the Victorian era. Mentmore was inherited by Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery, née Rothschild, and owned by her descendants, the Earls of Rosebery.\nMentmore was the first of what were to become virtual Rothschild enclaves in the Vale of Aylesbury. Baron Mayer de Rothschild began purchasing land in the area in 1846. Later, other members of the family built houses at Tring in Hertfordshire, Ascott, Aston Clinton, Waddesdon and Halton.\nThe Grand Hall at Mentmore. Aged just six months, Hannah de Rothschild laid the foundation stone for the great mansion on 31 December 1851.\nMuch of the parkland was sold in 1944, but Mentmore remained with the family until 1977. At that point, unable to come to an arrangement with the nation to preserve the building and contents intact as a Heritage property, the contents were auctioned, and it was sold to the Maharishi Foundation. In 1999, it was sold to investor Simon Halabi, who planned to build additional hotel and conference facilities. In 1992 the Mentmore Golf and Country Club opened, with two 18-hole courses.\nMentmore Towers is a Grade I listed building, with its park and gardens listed Grade II*.\nAfter circling around, through Crafton, we will lunch on Mentmore Green. there is a pub lunch or drink option here should you wish.\nAfter lunch we will continue towards Ledburn, turning off before and heading towards Slapton, via bridge 127. An unremarkable bridge with a remarkable history.\nFrom there we head down to the Grand Union Canal, which, we will follow round to Horton before heading back across to the station car park.\nThis walk is suitable for dogs. I love having dogs on walks and actively encourage people to bring them.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at The Climbing Hanger in Sheffield.\nCards/contactless ONLY  - this venue does not accept cash\nIf you haven't been to The Hangar before, please click\nhere\nto pre-register. Click on the link, scroll down, select Sheffield and follow the on-screen instructions. Completing the waiver prior to arrival will get you climbing faster.\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Consider this maybe as more of a day out rather than just another walk!\nCome join our trip from Essex to Suffolk and back, including a return boat trip* to a lovely coastal peninsula, around which we will do a 10.6 mile (17km) walk. Much of it is through part of the Suffolk and Essex Coast Heaths national landscape and we'll be taking in 2 Estuary Rivers.\n(*Please note there is a charge of £15 per person payable for this event to cover the cost of the return boat trip needed to get to and from the Peninsula)\nOur day will commence initially on the Essex coast in the historic maritime port town of Harwich. Originating in the 13th Century, this is now the 2nd most busy ferry and freight port in the UK.  We however, will be embarking a very much smaller craft (as pictured) from the quiet little Harwich Half Penny Pier harbour for a 10-minute trip across the water to the Suffolk coastal Shotley Peninsula.\nFrom the attractive Shotley Point Marina, we'll then commence our circular walk. Initially heading along the harbour side and onto the outskirts of the small town of Shotley Gate, we'll then follow the banks of the Estuary River Stour. We'll follow the path as it meanders along the estuary banks until we head off across some lovely open Suffolk countryside across to the other side of the peninsula.\nWe'll then arrive at the small village of Chelmondiston - from where we'll head through some scenic low undulating woodland to get to the very pretty and rural estuary hamlet of Pin Mill. Aside from being a very cute place, Pin Mill is known best for it's pub on the little quayside - The Butt and Oyster.\nOf course, we'll make a stop here to take in quayside views and some liquid refreshment. The pub is quite small and very popular for food, so eating there wouldn't be practical for us sadly but we'll find somewhere in the vicinity to also enjoy our packed lunch.\nOnce refuelled, we'll make out way through the beautiful area known as the Cliff Plantation which, as the name suggests, is an old plantation woodland on some low-level cliffs alongside the Estuary River Orwell. Through the trees, there are glimpses of the water and some interesting wooden houseboats as we walk along the riverside path.\nThe continuing estuary side route then takes us on some boardwalks and paths with wide open views of the Estuary River Orwell. As we get closer back to our start point, there are impressive views of the busy Felixstowe Shipping Port across the other side of estuary, creating a unique mix of the rural path we'll be on with the industrial container port across the water.\nAs we arrive back at Shotley Point, we’ll wander through much more of the marina this time with great views of the boats and harbour activity.\nDepending on timings, we should then have time for another refreshment stop at a bar in the marina before we catch our return boat trip back across to Harwich.\n*Note - the high-level view photos of the Marina and the Butt and Oyster Pub setting are drone shots. But nevertheless, the views we'll get on the walk are lovely!\nIs it dog friendly?\n4 legged friends are welcome and are allowed on the boat crossing if you're happy to take them onboard, Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

The aim is to reduce the vigour of bracken, which if left unchecked would smother other flora beneath it.  Without management, grass growth would be suppressed resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Bracken bashing enables flowers such as orchids and common harebells to thrive and to provide nectar sources for bees and butterflies.\nOur day will start with a safety briefing from Forestry England before we are let loose on the bracken.   We'll have a break for some lunch and after a few hours of hard work we'll find a local pub to enjoy a well deserved drink.\nAnd of course there will be cake!\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South West events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWestNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "On this one-way, westward walk along part of\nThe Wales Coast Path\nwe will find some interesting and scenic terrain, as well as some man-made features. Our starting point at the port of\nAmlwch is the northernmost town in Wales\n, and you’ll also pass the northernmost point of the Wales Coast Path at Llanlleiana Point. The return will be made by bus.\nInitially we will pass the area’s now derelict industry, including crossing the old railway and the old bromine works on Trwyn Costiog that looks like a set for a 1980s Dr Who episode. After Porth Wen, with its ruined brickworks, the path passes down and back up a feature known as Hell’s Mouth. A lookout tower built in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII marks Wales’ most northerly point. We encounter some more industrial ruins, those of the Porth Llanlleiana China works, which add a certain beauty to the landscape. The walk then follows spectacular clifftop paths, before reaching the church at Llanbadrig (translates as Patrick’s Church) as St Patrick was reputedly shipwrecked at the nearby island of Ynys Badrig. This is a church and graveyard with a superb view, and those with an interest in history can pop in to see the early Christian sculpted stone known as the Ichthus Stone.\nFrom Porth Padrig, the final section around Trwyn y Parc and into the fishing port of Cemaes, where the sandy beach makes it popular with tourists, and it’s a perfect place to end before catching the bus back.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified by at least 18:00 hours the night before in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved  and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event. Your dog needs to have the stamina to keep up with the group. Dogs are accepted on buses in Wales.\nAre you new to OutdoorLads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link for some useful information:\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

In addition to the wildlife, throughout the walk we'll see reminders of the impact that WWII had on the area (e.g. tank traps, ruins of buildings, anti-aircraft gun mountings).\nThose of you who wish can visit the Easington Lighthouse (the tallest in Northern England) if it is open on the day. Access to the ground floor is free but entry to the upper levels is £4 adult/£3 concessions.\nPlease see the website for further details\n.\nContinuing on, we'll go past the RNLI station houses and boat launch which, sadly after 213 years of sea rescues, is now\nclosed\n. Toward the end of the peninsula we'll see the ruins of Spurn Point gun batteries and other defence-related structures.\nThere is a visitor centre and cafe near the car park, which has toilet facilities.\nUnfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the parts of the reserve that we will be accessing.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a spooky Halloween weekend in the historic village of Boscastle, with its medieval core and quintessential Cornish harbour.\nThis is one of those weekend when you really want a good autumnal Cornish Haag to really build up the atmosphere and mysticism of the area.\nBoscastle is one of those places where you can feel the history of the smugglers, and pirates and wreckers in every breath you take, steeped in history, with countless authors and artists being inspired by its remoteness and rugged beauty. The hostel itself is next door to the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic so you just know this is going to be an interesting weekend.  You can even experience some spirits of a different kind at the Wellington Inn just around the corner - famous for having 3 ghosts wandering it's corridors....\nWhat's going to happen over the weekend\nFriday Evening:\nArrive, meet the rest of the group and socialise, welcome meeting and chill.  We'll have the usual buffet. Please bring something that can be shared between two or three people.\nSaturday Day:\nAfter breakfast (which is included in the event cost), we’ll have a walk planned heading into the surrounding countryside.\nPlease bring a packed lunch with you and maybe pack a flask for a hot drink if it’s cold.\nOr you can stay in the hostel and relax or take the day to explore the Cornish Coast if you've never visited the area.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax, socialise, and chillout until a Halloween Themed Dinner, included in the event cost.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast, we'll spend our final morning exploring the coast around Boscastle.  There may even be a visit to the nearby Tintagel Castle to the south, birthplace of King Arthur himself....\nAccessibility at Boscastle\nPlease note this hostel has options for anyone with accessibility needs.\nThis hostel includes a ground floor 6 bed dormitory with an accessible en-suite bathroom.  The lounge, dining and kitchen are all located on the ground floor.\nThere is good colour contrast to floor, walls and doorways throughout the building. All public areas, halls, stairs and landings are well lit using a combination of ceiling and wall lights. The corridor flooring is carpet throughout.\nUnfortunately there is no lift in the hostel to the 1st floor.\nIt is unlikely that the group day events over the weekend will be suitable if you have accessibility requirements but please contact the leader to discuss and to suggest alternatives you could do instead of the walks.\n(For anyone wondering - BIG Halloween is having a fallow year in 2025.)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Llanthony in the Vale of Ewyas is one of those, and this is your chance to disconnect from the network for the weekend.\nOur accommodation for the weekend is a converted barn used to store the farms market cart, but now provides shelter and rustic charm.  There are no sofas or TVs and you'll need to bring your own sleeping bag and pillow case, but there are hot showers!\nThe itinerary for the weekend will be:\nFriday Evening:\nArrive and choose a bunk bed. Meet with the rest of the group around the enormous dining table and I'm sure someone will light the wood burner. Dinner will be included but will be simple for those that might not arrive till later (probably jacket potatoes with a range of fillings).\nSaturday Daytime:\nAfter breakfast, it will be time to explore some of the stunning countryside surrounding Llanthony.  Prepare for a climb as no matter which way you look, the site is surrounded by hills and mountains, and we will be going up at least one of these to reach the views from the ridge lines.\nSaturday Evening:\nRelax and unwind. A simple dinner will be served and once we've cleared this away the board or card games will probably make an appearance. There's the option to walk the 50m or so to the cellar bar at Llanthony Priory or perhaps just read a book by that wood burner.\nSunday:\nAfter breakfast we'll need to clean and tidy the barn, but once everything is packed away there will be an option to head to Longtown (either by foot or by car) for a Sunday lunch before heading home.\nTea and coffee will be available throughout the weekend but you'll need to bring a packed lunch for Saturday and anything else you may want to drink (The Cellar Bar does offer 2 Pint Takeouts of the draft beers)\nDogs:\nDue to the limited social and sleeping spaces this event is not suitable for dogs.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our South Wales events please click on this Telegram link\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthWalesNotifications\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "OutdoorLads is pleased to be able to offer a very limited number of FREE places on this 2-day Mountain Skills course from Mountain Training held in Eryri (Snowdonia), North Wales.\nThe Mountain Skills course is an ideal choice for people interested in exploring mountainous terrain and wanting to develop their confidence in the mountains. It’s a great way to learn the essential skills you will need to enjoy the mountains in the UK safely. Whether you’d like to feel more confident using a map or you have ambitions to climb Everest, the Mountain Skills course is a great first step.\nThis course might be useful to those interested in going on to become OutdoorLads walk leaders (however this is not a leadership course but one designed to improve your personal mountain skills).\nDelivered by qualified and experienced mountain professionals, the course is nationally accredited and developed with Mountain Training, the awarding body for qualifications in walking, climbing and mountaineering.\nIt takes place entirely outdoors and covers a range of topics including what clothes you should wear, what equipment you should carry with you, how to plan your day out, what routes you can take, understanding the weather, how to navigate using paper and digital mapping and dealing with emergencies in the outdoors. You'll also get to enjoy your first experience of 'scrambling'. All under the watchful eye of experienced instructors who will share their knowledge with you and answer any questions you have about exploring the hills and mountains of the UK.\nThe course will run from 9am to 5pm on both Saturday and Sunday and you must attend both days.\nThere is small course fee of £10 that will need paying.\nOutdoorLads can cover this cost for active leaders - please drop a note to\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nif you'd like us to pay this for you.\nThis course will be led by an OutdoorLads Leader and run jointly with his own outdoor business so there will be non-ODL members on the course with you.\nPlaces are very limited so please only sign up if you're certain you're able to attend.\nThese courses typically cost up to £150.\nIf you're not local to Snowdonia you'll need to arrange your own accommodation nearby.\nYou can find out more about the course and a full syllabus at\nwww.mountainxperience.uk/activities/mountain-skills-snowdonia/\nor direct from Mountain Training at\nwww.mountain-training.org/personal-skills/hill-and-mountain-skills/mountain-skills\nReviews from previous ODL attendees:\n\"Simon was a great tutor.

Each night we will have a campfire and gather at the fire circle to share stories and make new friends, or reacquaint ourselves with old ones.\nThursday night will be an orientation evening, getting to know the estate and the surroundings.\nOn Friday there will be canoeing at Lechlade - a 20-minute drive away on the Upper Reaches of the River Thames, or a long country walk starting directly from the campsite.\nSaturday will see us head out for more serious walking… once again directly from camp and taking in some of the most glorious rolling countryside in England, returning to camp for relaxation before our catered BBQ on Saturday night, which is included in the event price.\nOn Sunday there will be the opportunity to visit the private gardens of the estate house itself.\nThere is also a farm shop and café where you are invited to have breakfast and to relax for a drink or a meal at any time during your stay (during opening hours 9am – 4pm)\nWe do so hope you can join us for this fabulous chance to enjoy a seriously chilled late summer vibe in a very relaxing place indeed.\nPlease note that this is not a commercial campsite and therefore there are no formal facilities except two gay portaloos which we will be providing for the duration of our stay.

    "People Attending": "11",
    "Summary": "The Capital Ring is a 120km/75 mile footpath orbiting central London at a distance of up to 10 miles from Big Ben. It was a collaboration between all of London's local authorities, and was completed in 2005. The route runs through urban and suburban outer London, utilising green space as much as possible.\nThis\nlinear\nwalk comprises section 1 and part of section 2 in the south-east, running a little under 16km/10 miles from Woolwich to Mottingham, and passing through Charlton, Shooters Hill & Eltham. It is entirely within the London borough of Greenwich.\nThe sights\nRoyal Arsenal, Woolwich\n: Since the mid-16th century, this part of London has been used for the manufacture & storage of armaments & munitions for the British armed forces. At its peak in the First World War, the site covered 1,285 acres and employed 80,000 people. The MoD finally left in 1994, and the area is gradually being redeveloped for commercial & housing purposes.\nWoolwich Ferry & Foot Tunnel\n: A ferry has linked Woolwich & North Woolwich across the Thames for more than 700 years, and since 1889 has operated as a free service carrying vehicles & foot passengers. The Woolwich foot tunnel was opened in 1912, and links the official beginning & end of the Capital Ring footpath.\nThames Barrier\n: Completed in 1982 following floods in 1928 & 1953, the barrier protects central London from tidal & storm surges in the North Sea. Since becoming operational, it has been raised 221 times.\nMaryon & Maryon Wilson Parks\n: These well-wooded public parks were donated to the London County Council in 1891 & 1924 by the Maryon-Wilson family. The parks are remnants of an ancient forest known as Hanging Wood.\nCharlton House: Built in 1607-12 for Sir Adam Newton, this is one of the finest examples of Jacobean architecture in London. It eventually passed into the Maryon-Wilson family, and after service as a WW1 hospital, was sold to Greenwich council in 1925. It is now open to the public.\nSeverndroog Castle\n: This 18th-century folly was built in 1784 by his widow to commemorate Commodore Sir William James, who in 1755 captured the pirate fortress of Suvarnadurg in India. It is 18m/63 feet high, and features a tearoom & viewing platform.\nOxleas Wood\n: Parts of this ancient area of deciduous woodland date back 8,000 years to the end of the last Ice Age, and form a 72ha/180 acre Site of Special Scientific Interest. The café at the top of Oxleas Meadow is at a height of 105m/350 feet, and commands magnificent views over western Kent & eastern Surrey.\nConduit Head\n: This brick structure is part of the water supply system for Eltham Palace about 0.5 miles away, and was built in the late 15th century.\nEltham Palace\n: Originally built around 1300, the palace was a royal residence from the 14th to the 16th centuries - the future Henry VIII grew up here. With the completion of the much grander Greenwich Palace in 1500, Eltham was used less and less, and by the 1650s was in a ruinous state apart from the Great Hall of 1470. The lease was acquired by Stephen & Virginia Courtauld in 1933, who proceeded to  construct a fine modern house in the Art Deco style, incorporating the restored Great Hall. After wartime Army use, the palace passed to English Heritage in 1995.\nThe route\n(see location section for OS link):\nStarting at Woolwich Elizabeth Line station, we'll head north through Woolwich Arsenal to reach the Thames Path and follow it west, past the Woolwich ferry to the Thames Barrier. We'll then turn south, heading through Maryon-Wilson, Charlton & Hornfair Parks and crossing Woolwich Common to reach the A207 at Shooters Hill. Crossing this road into Eltham Common, we will pass Severndroog Castle, Jackwood to arrive at Oxleas Wood Café, where we will pause for lunch.\nAfter the break, we will head down through Oxleas Wood to Rochester Way and cross it to reach Shepherdleas Wood, Eltham Park North, and the footbridge over the A2 which marks the start of Capital Ring section 2. We'll then walk around Eltham Park South, Avery Hill Park, past Conduit Head, and along Footscray Road and North Park to reach Eltham Palace. Finally, we'll follow King John's Walk around the perimeter of the palace and beside fields to reach Middle Park Avenue leading to Mottingham station.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, but they will need to be on a lead along busy roads and footpaths and in proximity to livestock. At all other times, a dog must be obedient.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

We'll take our time and climb through the valley all the way to Twmpa otherwise known as Lord Hereford's Knob. Here, you can enjoy the stunning views across to Hay-On-Wye whilst eating your packed lunch.\nWe'll then follow the Cambrian Way path along the Darren Lwyd Ridge taking in more stunning views of the Black Mountains before a steep drop back into Capel-y-ffin.\nAlthough the route is only 8 miles it can be very muddy in places and involves a long climb to Lord Hereford's Knob and a steep decent at the end.\nWhilst dogs are most welcome on the walk it is likely they will need to remain on a lead throughout the walk. When not passing through farm lands there are sheep and wild ponies grazing on the open land.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join Alex on this 9.5-mile exploration of Cambridge's lesser-known sights as well as its famous colleges.\nWe will meet at Cambridge North station and head south across the River Cam into Ditton Meadows, with the church of Fen Ditton in the background, before reaching our first destination, the Leper Chapel, dating from the 12th century. From there we will pass Cambridge United's Abbey Stadium and follow Coldman's Brook, a minor tributary of the Cam, along the edge of Coldman's Common.\nWe will then turn westwards into the suburb of Romsey and pass Cambridge Central Mosque, nominated for the 2021 Stirling Prize for architecture. Heading along the vibrant Mill Road we will cross the railway and enter the Petersfield area, where our route takes us via the leafy Mill Road Cemetery. We will then weave our way between Victorian terraced houses before reaching Parker's Piece, a large open space where the rules of modern football were codified.\nFrom Parker's Piece we will continue via the tree-lined Christ's Pieces and head into the historic city centre. We will pass the Guildhall, Great St Mary's Church and of course King's College Chapel. Crossing to the western side of the river, we will see the famous Mathematical Bridge, before turning northwards along the Backs with its fine views of King's. We will then pass Gonville & Caius, Trinity and St John's Colleges as well as the 12th-century Round Church, inspired by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nThe final section of our walk meanders alongside the Cam past Jesus Green and Midsummer Common. We will make a short detour to the remains of a 13th-century priory before heading back to the river to the Cambridge Museum of Technology. There we will stop for a well-deserved drink at The Engineer's House, a beer garden with a pleasant riverside atmosphere. From there it is an easy stroll along Stourbridge Common back to Cambridge North.\nDon't waste that space!\nPlease only book if you know you can make it.

It now has a permanent home on the banks of the river Clyde.\nThe Riverside Museum\nis Glasgow's award-winning transport and technology museum. It is the first purpose-built museum created by Glasgow Life in the 21st century. The building opened in 2011 and has many exhibits of national and international importance.\nThere is another transport related exhibition nearby on the other side of the river. With the recently opened Govan footbridge, this is now a short walk from our main event.\nFairfield Heritage\nis a community museum dedicated to telling the story of Govan’s outstanding role in world shipbuilding. It closes at 4pm therefore we will make this out first stop. Explore the very building that was once the headquarters of the greatest shipbuilding enterprise in the world. The Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering Company Ltd, which in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionised sea transportation, building the largest and fastest vessels the world had ever seen.\nAfter Fairfields we'll pass the\nGovan Stones\nwhich are not transport related, but worth a quick look. The carved stones come from the surrounding 1,500-year-old early medieval churchyard and include the Govan Sarcophagus, five Anglo-Scandinavian style Viking-Age\nhogbacks\n, four upright crosses, the 'Govan Warrior' carving, and a wide range of recumbent cross-slab burial monuments, with most seemingly dating to between the 9th and 11th centuries AD.\nPhotos:\ntaken by Brendan70\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "A manhood or two might well be seen on the isolated naturist beach we'll visit, but Manhood is also the name of the peninsula that stretches south from Chichester to Selsey Bill. It is a strongly horizontal landscape of contrasting blocks of colour. Wide golden wheat fields and broad brown mudflats are backed by big skies, while the regular rows of poplars, the massed masts of yachts and the sporadic spires of churches provide vertical punctuation. Much of the area has been reclaimed from the sea and is drained by the ditches we'll follow, along with the Chichester Canal. The scattered settlements domesticate an expanse so flat that despite walking 17 kilometres, we'll not climb at all.\nThe sights:\nThe Manhood Peninsula:\nThe southernmost part of Sussex and part of the Sussex coastal plain. Bordered to the west by Chichester Harbour and to the east by Pagham Harbour. Its name comes from the Old English\nmaene-wudu\nmeaning \"men's wood\" or \"common wood\", i.e. common land.\nChichester Canal:\nOpened in 1822, its last load was transported in 1906. Runs 4.5 miles (7.2 km) from Birdham to Chichester. Some of its length is still navigable and the towpath is a popular route.\nSidlesham:\nSet among cornfields are half a dozen scattered hamlets, the nicest being Sidlesham Quay beside Pagham Harbour, which looks like a miniature Bosham. We will have lunch here. The historic\nCrab & Lobster\npub has a lovely garden.\nPagham Harbour:\nA glorious, tranquil area of saltmarsh, mudflats, saltings (for salt extraction) and shallow lagoons. Precious for wildlife as it's an SSSI, a Local Nature Reserve and a Ramsar Site. You could see curlew sandpiper and shelduck on the mudflats and long-tailed tit and willow warbler in the hedges.\nChurch Norton:\nJust the chancel remains from an old church, simple C13, with some fine tombs. The setting is the remarkable thing: surrounded by trees and almost on the shore, the leafy, isolated locale is rare on the Sussex coastal strip. The secluded shingle spit nearby is a nudist beach. The sea water is always clean as there are no sewage outfalls nearby. You're invited to check the quality at Southern Water's\nBeachbuoy\nsite or at the\nSurfers Against Sewage\nsite.\nThe\nroute\n(please note that this is a linear walk. A bus will take us back to Chichester)\n:\nWe'll leave Chichester by way of the canal and walk along it to Hunston. At Hunston, we'll walk to Hunston Church along Church Lane. We'll then use footpaths to go to South Mundham and use Fisher Lane to Fisher Farm. Further footpaths will take us to Bramber Farm and Honer Farm. We'll then walk around Paghan Harbour to Halsey's Farm and then pretty Sidlesham Quay for lunch. We could also have a drink at the Crab & Lobster pub. Further walking around Pagham Harbour will bring us to the hinge of Pagham Harbour Spit at Church Norton for a break and a swim. Footpaths and then a walk along Grange Lane and Rectory Lane will take us to the B2145 and the bus stop.\nGetting the bus back:\nThe No. 51 Stagecoach bus departs for Chichester every 30 minutes (at 33 and 53 minutes past the hour). It takes around 30 minutes to walk from the beach to the bus stop. The fare is £3, payable by any means.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them apart from during very hot weather. There is sea for them to splash in but little shade. Dogs are permitted at Church Norton Beach but there are no poop bins. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(Image credits: Shingle beach south of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View north across Pagham Harbour; Photo ©\nIan Cunliffe\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Leisure pursuits; Photo ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Gate on footpath between Honer Farm and Halsey's Farm: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Breach Pool north of Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh at Sidlesham Quay: Photo ©\nPatrick Roper\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bremere Rife with reed bed: Photo ©\nJeff Gogarty\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Saltmarsh, Pagham Harbour: Photo ©\nSimon Carey\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pagham Harbour: foreshore north of Church Norton: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); A Several - one of several: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); and View northwards along the shingle ridge, Selsey East Beach: Photo ©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n). All pictures are copyrighted but are licensed for reuse under\nCreative Commons CC-BY-SA 2.0\nand are here attributed to their copyright holders.)",

It's a worthy, free, fun,  legal event, run by volunteers with the aim of making the world a better place for everyone.\nWe'll meet at 6.30pm, ready to join the ride round the city centre which starts around 7.00pm and takes about 90 minutes at a very gentle pace.\nCleaner environment, safer roads, healthier lifestyles, better attitudes\nThe ride demonstrates the vulnerability of cyclists while celebrating body freedom and is a protest against fossil fuels and car culture.\nBare as you dare\nAs it's a \"naked\" ride, clothing is optional. OutdoorLads requires you to wear a helmet and suitable footwear (trainers / cycling shoes)\nThere is no pressure to be completely naked.\nThe event has a carnival feel, so you are encouraged to adorn yourself with colourful body paint and slogans, wear fancy dress, disguise yourself a bit (eg sunglasses, helmet, mask) or remain partially dressed – be as bare as you dare.\nMany passers by and photographers who know about the event will take photographs before the event begins and along the route. There will be lots of people with cameras and phones. If you're at all uncomfortable with appearing naked in photos, you're welcome to wear shorts, speedos, etc.\nJoin us for other upcoming cycling events:\nSaturday 14 June:\nBike Week 2025: Riverbank Coffee Leisure Cycle (Manchester)\nSunday 15 June:\nBike Week 2025: Cheshire Lanes to Jodrell Bank (Cheshire East)\nSunday 15 June:\nBike Week 2025: Beginner Friendly Road Cycle from Telford to Birmingham (Shropshire)\nSaturday 21 June:\nRainbow Riders Social Ride to the Pink Picnic (Salford Pride)\nMore upcoming events can be found on our\nOutdoorLads Cycling Calendar\n(after opening the link, click on \"Calendar\" to sort the events into date order).\nPhoto credit: wnbrmanchester\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event.",

From there the going is a little easier as we continue along and up the ridge to\nHelvellyn\n’s summit (925m), and then continue, descending a little at first to\nWhite Side\n(863m) ticking off the final Wainwright of the day, before the descent, down the old-pony route, over Brown Crag and back to our starting point.\nAlthough this is a 'ridge walk', it's not technical, however the ascent and descent are steep and sustained, and the distance (c.16Km/10miles) and ascent (c.1,050m) will make this a long \"mountain day\".\nThis\nis the intended route.\nFor those wanting the more technical option - I plan to lead a \"Saturday-Scramble over Helvellyn's edges\" towards the end of the summer!\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list. Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the\nCountryside Code\n.

The monks brew the only Trappist beer in Britain which is available for sale from the gift shop.\nBlackbrook Reservoir\nwas constructed in 1796 in order to feed the Charnwood Forest Canal, which has long since vanished. The first dam constructed was an earthwork one that failed 1799. In eleven minutes, the reservoir was empty and local farmland was ruined, sheep were drowned, and much of Shepshed and nearby Loughborough were affected by flood waters.\nThe dam was repaired in 1801, but the canal was no longer commercially viable. The present gravity dam was constructed in 1906 and in 1957 it felt the effects of a magnitude 5.3 earthquake. The tremors caused heavy coping stones to shift, and cracks appeared in the faces of the dam.\nThere is an option to visit the\nBull's Head\npub for a drink (and food) after the walk.\nDogs are welcome but must be kept on a lead when required and under control at all times.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked, please\nadd yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by the event leader / venue.\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "You might want to pack your trunks along with your lunch for this one. To be honest, the walk, on the pine-forested, bracken-covered, steep-sided knolls of Bourne Woods will neither be that tame, nor the swim, in the sandy-bottomed, lifeguard-supervised, top-rated waters of Frensham Great Pond, that wild. If you'd rather not swim you can enjoy a leisurely lunch break lolling on the sandy beach or visiting the cafés. Bonus features of this walk include the pretty village of Frensham, and the National Trust-protected woods and heaths roundabout, but the centrepiece will be (weather, crowds and blue-green algae permitting) a summertime splash in a superb setting.\nThe sights:\nFrensham village:\nSt Mary's Church dates from 1239 and contains many original features, despite restoration. There is also a large cauldron which allegedly either belonged to the local witch Mother Ludlam, or the fairies.\nFrensham Great Pond, Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Commons:\nThe lakes are 12th-century fishponds created for the Bishop of Winchester. The Commons that surround them are important SSSIs, home to Dartford warblers, sand lizards and nightjars, and managed by the National Trust. In World War II the ponds were drained, but they were subsequently restored and became a popular spot for London daytrippers in the past and the film and TV industry forever since (for example\nCarry on Jack\n(1963),\nCarry on Columbus\n(1991) and\nThe Mummy\n(1999), doubling as the River Nile). Waverley District Council run a café and toilets next to the Great Pond where the swimming takes place.\nBourne Wood:\nSilver birches and pines cloak a knoll in which a clearing affords lovely views over Farnham and surrounding woodland. Here, the Forestry Commission and RSPB have to balance the needs of nature, recreation and, notably, the UK film industry as it is frequent film and TV location (including\nTenko\n,\nIt Ain't Half Hot Mum\n,\nGladiator\n(2000) (where it stood in for the forests of Germania), various\nHarry Potter\ns,\nWar Horse\n(2011),\nThor: The Dark World\n(2013) and\nNapoleon\n(2022). See\nhere\nfor a list of films shot here.\nSwimming at Frensham Great Pond:\nSwimming isn't compulsory or prolonged and it will coincide with our lunch break. The two designated swimming areas are not large, or deep, but are enough to cool off. The water is clean-smelling and slightly silty. The water quality, regularly sampled, is generally rated 'Excellent' or 'Good' but after prolonged spells of warm weather blue-green algae can bloom and preclude swimming. I will, of course, monitor the situation.\nDogs are not permitted on the beach but can go near the café and walk through the site.\nIn very warm weather the pond and adjacent beach gets busy and people are warned to stay away as the car park closes (which won't affect us). We will see how we feel about the situation on the day. Check for more details\nhere\n.\nDogs\nI love having dogs on my walks, and this is a good dog walk as there is little livestock to be encountered, abundant heathland over which the dog can run free and trees to provide shade. However, there will be some roads to cross and short stretches of road walk along. Furthermore, dogs are not permitted on the beach at the pond and hot weather could be exhausting for them.\nThe route\n(please click the link\nhere\n)\n:\nA range of pleasant and prosperous suburban streets will lead us through The Bourne, Shortheath and Boundstone (in short, the southwestern suburbs of Farnham) to Rowledge. Switchback Lane will take us to Frensham Heights School and a lane will take us east to Broomfield Lane to Shortfield Common. Footpaths heading south will take us to Frensham village and then Frensham Common. Bearing east after lunch, we'll walk from the Great Pond to the Little Pond. We'll then head northeast to cross the River Wey and cross The Reeds Road. We'll head northwest across Farnham Heath and Bourne Wood and go through Lower Bourne along suburban streets back to the station.\n(Images credits: The beach, Frensham Great Pond; Sandbank, Frensham Common; and Sandy tracks, Frensham Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nAlan Hunt\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Path into Bourne Wood and Path on Tankersford Common:\nPhoto\ns ©\nDavid Martin\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Small Ford on Grange Road:\nPhoto\n©\nNigel Mykura\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Frensham Little Pond and Frensham Little Pond view from the west side:\nPhoto\n©\nStefan Czapski\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "This event is intended as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community; everyone will be warmly welcomed\nCome along for a lovely Saturday climb with Outdoorlads! The vast majority of events offered through Outdoorlads are separated into Bouldering or Indoor Climbing but we're spoiled at our chosen venue with a wide selection of both types. So if you're not sure what to try or you enjoy all types of climbing, this event is for you!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nBouldering is a form of climbing that focuses on shorter \"problems\" emphasising technique, balance, body positioning, and sometimes power, rather than long, high routes. Without the need for ropes, harnesses, and belaying, bouldering is an accessible activity for newcomers and is often considered the \"purest\" form of climbing. As no ropes are involved you will be able to quickly join the rest of the bouldering group without needing to be supervised. Don't worry however, you wont be left on your own. We're a friendly bunch who will be happy to share tips and show you round the centre's varied routes, and the leader will be on hand to introduce you to the group and to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you only want to boulder, all you will need to do is register with the centre, watch a safety video, and answer some questions based on the video. if you're unsure, look out for the leader when you arrive who will help you thorough this process.\nWhat is Climbing?\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends and develop your climbing skills. It focuses on longer and higher routes which require more stamina but don't worry as you'll be wearing a harness and attached to a rope.\nClimbing has a slightly steeper learning curve than bouldering as it requires you to be proficient with ropes and belay skills before you can climb unsupervised. But don't let that put you off as with some supervised sessions, you will be scaling the walls in no time.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nFor bouldering - absolutely!! There is a good selection of climbing and the leader can help you adjust and climb safely and effectively.\nThe main type of rope climbing on offer at this event is lead climbing, which requires those attending to have a basic understanding/introduction to Harnesses, knots and belaying first.\nSo after some consideration, we don't believe this particular event is suitable for complete beginners and we would recommend you have done your first session at one of our other events. However, if you have done\none session\nat another event and you are comfortable with climbing (or just need a refresher) please don't be put off! Sign up and let the leader know! We are still more than happy to take on climbers who are only just starting out.\nI'm a proficient climber - what do I need to know?\nIf you are already an experienced climber, you will still need to register with the centre (which you can do\nhere\nselecting the 18+ unsupervised form) and pass the centre's safety test. After that we will get you paired up with another climber so you can head out and explore the centre along with the rest of the climbing group.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nWe have no control or influence over the centre's safety test and if you do not pass the test, you will not be able to climb unsupervised. If there is availability with a leader, they will be happy to supervise you so you can climb and practice the areas which need improving so you are ready to take the test again at a later date. If a leader is already supervising others however you may not be able to climb but will be able to boulder in the centre instead.\nAs a general guide, if you answer \"no\" to any of the following questions, you should opt for a supervised session. As noted above we do not recommend this event for your first climbing session but please contact the leader if you are unsure.\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie into a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay and lower down another climber correctly and confidently?\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.",

    "Summary": "Please note the change of date of this walk and cancel if you can't attend. My apologies for any inconvenience.\nThis walk uncovers some beauty and interest (and allows a swim) amid the sprawling seaside suburbia typical of the south coast. Half the walk will be suburban but half will be rural. First, we'll cross Highdown Hill, which is more prominent topographically (the views are superb) and mythically (the resting place of Saxon kings) than its modest height of 81 m suggests. Second, and after a visit to the freebie Highdown Gardens, we'll cross bungalowland to see flint cottages and farms and a private estate. In the latter, a house designed by a Bauhaus master and then an art deco garage will bring a dash of international chic to all the mock-Tudor mansions.\nThe sights:\nAngmering:\nBuilt inland on two hillocks with a green inbetween. Not yet swamped with houses like its seaside suburb of Angmering-on-Sea at East Preston. St Margaret's Church is mostly by noted architect SS Teulon, as is the school and vestry hall opposite. All display his characteristic complex planning and polychrome brick, except for the C12 chancel arch and tower. A very pretty village centre with flint cottages, manicured lawns and lush planting.\nHighdown Hill:\nA small but isolated promontory off the main South Downs belt, just 81m high but giving great views. In the property of the National Trust and the traditional burial-place of the Saxon kings of Sussex. Late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC) enclosure and early Iron Age (around 600 BC) hill fort. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery with around 90 graves has been excavated. In the C18, local miller John Olliver had his tomb built on the hill 27 years before his death in 1793. It is said that he was the leader of local smugglers and used the tomb to store contraband. He would set the sails of his windmill at different angles to indicate the absence of customs men to his followers out at sea. A runaway millstone from Ecclesden Mill is said to have given its name to a local farm and now garden centre.\nKingston Gorse:\nIn Angmering parish, a private estate of 'individually designed houses built after 1930 but mostly 1960s or later larger replacements offering a good chance to see many cliches of domestic design' (The Buildings of England - Sussex: West (Williamson, Hudson, Musson and Nairn)). Of the three best houses of the Modern Movement, only one is visible: Sea Lane House, 1936-7 by Marcel Breuer with FRS Yorke. Marcel Breuer worked at the Bauhaus where he was mentored by Walter Gropius before working in Britain between 1933 and 1938. His most famous work is the Wassily Chair.\nFerring:\nAn old flint cobble village swallowed up by seaside bungalows, typical of the Sussex coast from the Witterings to Lancing. The core, by the C13 roughcast church of St Andrew, along Church Lane is quite pretty.\nEast Preston:\nA few old cottages near the church among the well-to-do suburbia. St Mary the Virgin, C12 with a C19 aisle added by Sir George Gilbert Scott as the population expanded. Actor and comedian Stanley Holloway (1890-1982), famous as Alfred Doolittle in\nMy Fair Lady\n, is buried in the churchyard. Private estates were built between the old centre and the sea as part of Angmering-on-Sea Garden Village. Mostly big thatched cottages built at the end of the Arts and Crafts style, some mock-Tudor houses and a remarkable survival, a garage of 1929 given an up-to the-minute frontage in 1934 in a cool\nmoderne\nstyle. The Shell petrol pumps from the late 1930s/early 1940s remain. Now converted into flats.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe start by heading north from Angmering Station up Station Road to Angmering village centre. Heading east along the High Street ascend Highdown Hill which we'll descend after seeing the fort ramparts and having lunch. After crossing the A259 and railway line we'll briefly head west and southwest through the suburbs of Ferring and cross Ferring Rife to go to Kingston Gorse and the beach. We'll then head east along the beach and turn inland at Sea Road. After detouring to see the garage we'll head north through East then West Preston and go back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this is a near-perfect summer walk for them if it is not too hot: it'll be cool in the trees, even cooler in the sea, and it's not too long. There are some lanes to walk down and busy roads to cross but they can run free on Highdown Hill and Kingston Gorse beach. Dogs are not permitted in Highdown Gardens, so dog owners will have to wait in the tea rooms or bar.\n(Picture credits: Beach Huts, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n;\nLooking Eastwards down Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; The Nineteen Acres, The In Close, Upper West Field by\nSimon Carey\n; Trig point on Highdown Hill by\nRobin Webster\n; Highdown Hill by\nSimon Carey\n; The Miller's Tomb by\nDavid Martin\n; Highdown Hill by C\nhris Thomas-Atkin\n; Looking West from Highdown Hill by\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n; Windmill on the downs above Angmering by\nDavid Martin\n; Post box in the wall by\nSandy B\n; Enjoying the Coastline by\nSandy B\n; Kingston Beach by\nSimon Carey\n; Ferring Rife by\nPeter Webster\n; Maytree Cottage/ Evergreen Cottage, Church Lane/Ferring Street, Ferring by\nSimon Carey\n. Images permitted for use under Creative Commons License\nCC BY-SA 2.0\n.

With panoramic views across Weymouth and Portland to the south and Dorchester and surrounding areas to the north. Walking along the chalk down then down through the valley back to Dorchester.\nThe massive ditches and banks of Maiden Castle, stretching across a saddle-backed hilltop 914 metres long, are the end result of many centuries of modification and enlargement during the Iron Age.\nThe first early Iron Age (800–550 BC) hillfort enclosed only the eastern end of the hill, with a single rampart and a V-shaped ditch. The original rampart was probably dumped earth, stone and chalk from the ditch, but a complex timber revetted wall flanked the two entrances.\nIn the middle Iron Age (550–300 BC), a much larger area of 19 hectares was enclosed including the western end of the hill, allowing more people to live within the defences.\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see\n(Keeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

For those who fancy a challenge at the start, we’ll climb the 199 steps to the top of the spire (entry £3.50) for panoramic views across the Wolds.\nThe route then passes through Hubbard’s Hills, a wooded valley with a stream and footbridges, before heading out into the Wolds, taking in the rural landscapes around Welton Vale. Here, you’ll spot the Whale Bone Arch—a curious and unexpected landmark with maritime origins, tucked into the landscape as a nod to seafaring history.\nFrom there, we continue through South Elkington, where the 15th-century All Saints Church stands above the village among mature trees, offering views across open countryside. We’ll take a short break at The Shop—a small local spot serving tea, coffee, and ice cream—before making our way back to Louth.\nAfter the walk, we’ll head to the Greyhound Inn for a well-earned drink or bite to eat.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is in\nHorncastle\n, just 13 miles (22 minutes) away.\nOS Route Map\nLincolnshire Walks 2025\n17/05/25 -\nNettleton Top Day Walk\n- Near Caistor\n14/06/25 -\nGibraltar Point Nature Trail\n-\nNear Skegness\n19/07/25 -\nA stroll on the Viking Way\n- Near Market Rasen\n27/07/25 -\nTurf Maze & Tideway Trail\n- Near Scunthorpe (live soon!)\n16/08/25 -\nSpire Views and Whale Bones\n- Near Louth\n23/08/25-\nThe Gringley Ramble\n- Near Gainsborough (live soon!)\n06/09/25 -\nUp the Hill & Through the Glory Hole\n- Near Lincoln (live soon!)\n04/10/25 -\nWaters’ Edge & Wetlands Trail\n- Near Barton (live soon!)\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

A 16th-century manor house in origin.\nWilliam Hawtrey built the current mansion around 1565, and it may have involved the reconstruction of an earlier building. A reception room in the house bears his name today. Soon after its construction, Hawtrey acted as a custodian at Chequers for Lady Mary Grey, younger sister of Lady Jane Grey and great-granddaughter of King Henry VII. Lady Mary had married without the monarch's consent and was banished from court by Queen Elizabeth I and kept confined as punishment. Lady Mary remained at Chequers for two years.

    "Summary": "Join us for a walk across Wigan Flashes and along part of the Leeds & Liverpool canal, to the probable site of Wigan's famous pier!\nThe Flashes are lakes created by mining subsidence and now a nature reserve.  The canal cuts through the centre of Wigan and provides an interesting walking route through the town, as we look for Wigan's elusive pier.  This is a leisurely circular walk of 10 miles / 16.5 kilometres, along canal towpaths and urban trails.  Ascent is around 60 metres, so the walk is fairly flat!\nThe word “pier” perhaps creates an image of seaside resorts like Blackpool and other resorts along England’s south coast that have, or had, a pier.  References to “\nWigan Pier\n” are a long-standing joke, as Wigan is nowhere near the coast and has nothing resembling a typical seaside pier.  The original “pier” at Wigan is thought to have been a wooden jetty, where coal wagons from a nearby colliery were unloaded into waiting barges on the canal. It disappeared long ago, but the joke lives on!  It is thought to have been located at some old warehouses that do survive, near the town centre.\nYou may also recognise the phrase because of a book named\nThe Road to Wigan Pier,\nwritten in 1937 by\nGeorge Orwell\n, a journalist and novelist.  It’s not an easy read, however, being about poverty in early 20th century northern England.  George Orwell is probably more famous for having written the novels\nAnimal Farm\nand\nNineteen Eighty-Four\n.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs are welcome on the walk, but must be under control at all times and on a lead when walking through fields with livestock or where wildlife might be disturbed.  We are likely to encounter a lot of other dogs on this walk - parts of it are popular dog-walking territory!\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPhoto credits\n: photos by the event leader with permission given to OutdoorLads for their use.",

Stanton Moor, a finger of gritstone amid limestone country, rises to 1,060 feet (323m) and is open, breezy, heather clad moorland giving glorious views across the valley of the Derwent. It's two chief characteristics, are the curious rock formations and the vast number of prehistoric remains - burial chambers, standing stones, circles and fortifications - that litter the moor.\nAfter circumnavigating the moor, our descent takes in the old quarry village of Birchover. We continue from here along a combination of tracks and field paths on the approach to the gritstone tor of Robin Hood`s Stride. Cratcliffe Tor can be found nearby. At its foot, we find the Hermit`s Cave, notable for the 12th Century crucifix carved into the rock.\nMore field paths, a stroll down a quiet lane, then a short, sharp climb, lead us to Elton, an attractive village of stone cottages. We finish off by following the Limestone Way back to Winster.\nWalk Highlights:\nstone circle known as Nine Ladies, Robin Hoods Stride, Winster, Birchover, Elton, Cratcliffe Tor and Hermits Cave.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "After its wide valley north of Hartington, the River Dove flows through the gorge-like Bereford and Wolfscote dales.  Many declare these dales to be as equally attractive as Dovedale proper, and this superlatively beautiful ramble includes two of the loveliest Peak District villages, some sweeping views and long stretches of glorious riverside walking through the dales themselves.\nThe first village, which is our starting point, is Hartington, dominated by a large and handsome medieval church.  Once a bustling centre, the limestone houses, inns and shops grouped attractively around the spacious market place have the atmosphere more of a small town than a village. Later we'll visit Alstonefield, a delightfully unspoiled and peaceful village before heading for Berefords Dale for a charming walk through the dales back to Hartington.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

And for those who may have attended Big Spring Camp it would be good to hear the lowdown!\nThese socials are a good opportunity to compare notes about the wonderful local activities run by the group, such as the even popular Reading indoor bouldering events, hikes, socials, support for local Pride events (Oxford, Reading and London for example) and weekend hostelling. This event is also particularly ideal for new members who want to find out more about the group and events being arranged in the locality.\nFor those returning to the station afterwards you may wish to drop by the Blagrave Arms (Reading’s only LGBT+ bar) which is closeby!\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nThis venue is not suitable for dogs.\nImage credits:\nEvent Leader\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Celebrate diversity and inclusion with us as we march through the vibrant streets of York for one of the North’s most colourful and welcoming Pride events. Whether you're a regular or new to OutdoorLads, come along, show your pride, and enjoy a fun day of community, visibility, and adventure. All are welcome—let’s make it a day to remember! York Pride Parade is one of the longest in the country at 2.4 miles, and takes around 60-90 minutes to complete, so please wear appropriate comfortable footwear.\nThe parade ends at the Pride Festival site on Knavesmere, where you will be free to do what you want. There will be live entertainment on the Main Stage, a Cabaret Stage that has numerous local acts and usually some celebrity to headline with going on until about 7.00pm, Pride Market stall, plenty of food and drink vendors and even a fun fair. You can also bring your own food and drink if you want to make a picnic of it. It is a free event, but you can support it by buying a wristband.\nThere are usually a couple of after parties in the town centre and even a club night if you're up to it. (I probably won't stay after about 5.30pm, but I expect it'll be fairly busy in town ). More information can be found on York Pride website and FB pages.\nFrom the Knavesmire it's just 15 minutes walk back to York station.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Our hostel is nestled in the shadow of some of the most well known hills in the country - The Cuillins - tall, sharp and serious lumps of rocks that since the early days of british mountaineering have been a training ground for those planning trips to the Alps.

    "Summary": "Come and join OutdoorLads for some bouldering in central London!\nThis event is for members of all levels of experience and all are welcome to come along to any of the sessions.\nBouldering is a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems', as they are referred to, tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nIndependent boulderer?\nAs above all attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible  for your own safety actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

    "Summary": "Bike Week 2025 is taking place from June 9–15, and it's our chance to be part of the UK’s biggest celebration of cycling\nWhether you ride every day or haven’t cycled in years, Bike Week is all about showcasing how cycling can fit into daily life - for everyone.\nA\nleisurely social bike\nride\ninto the Cheshire countryside and a visit to the Pavilion Cafe at Jodrell Bank, the radio telescope\nThe majority of this ride will be on quiet rural roads, with a few short off-road sections, heading out from Wilmslow. We have a choice of routes to Alderley Edge, either a short very steep climb or a much longer gentler climb, either route brings us to the ridge where we can make a short walk to a fine view point from the sandstone cliffs over the Cheshire Plain. The route can be decided on the day, based on the group preference.\nAfter descending from the Edge, we can take another short break at Redesmere Lake, before passing through the villages of Siddington, Lower Withington and Goostrey en route to a cafe/lunch stop at the Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope.\nOur return journey will take us through Chelford before an off road section to avoid main roads, before another visit to Alderley Edge, but no climbing this time as we pass through the village.\nThis event is around 27\nmiles\nand is reasonably flat except for the hills around Alderley Edge. Whilst the majority of the route is on quiet lanes, please note we do pass through Wilmslow on some busier roads.\nWe have plenty of time to complete the route and we will take it at a relaxed pace and no one will be left behind.\nRoad cyclists:\nPlease be aware some paths might be a little rough and bumpy for thin tyres, but doable none the less.\nMountain bikers:\nThe majority of the route will be on paved surfacing, so knobbly tyres will be a little over kill for the ride, but don't worry it will be at a slow pace.\nPace and Terrain\nThis will be a leisurely cycle suitable for those of all levels of fitness. The majority of the route is on quiet rural lanes, with some short off road sections. This event is open to cyclists of all abilities and bike types. There is a significant climb near the start to Alderley Edge, otherwise the majority of the ride is relatively flat, with just a couple of small hills en route, but nothing too long, and no harm if you need to walk up them.\nIf you're not a regular cyclist, please do make sure your bike is in good condition - check the tyres are well inflated, chain is oiled, and you've got a spare inner tube, drinks and snacks with you.\nEvent images:\nAll images were taken by the event leader and permission to use them is granted to OutdoorLads.\nKeep in Touch\nIf you'd like to hear about our cycling events as soon as they are published, then subscribe to our Social Media & Instant Messenger channels.\nFacebook\n,\nTelegram\n,\nTwitter\nYou can chat with our members on\nFacebook\nand\nTelegram\n, and join our\nStrava\nclub\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space\nbefore\nattending a cycling event.",

    "Summary": "Join Outdoor Lads for a summer hike in the north of Eryri National Park, ascending the mountains of the Northern Carneddau.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nLlyn Anafon:\nDuring our ascent, we'll follow the Anafon River to Llyn Anafon. The river itself is a habitat to many freshwater invertebrates and fish. The llyn is currently the site of a rewilding project to restore it to a more natural state, encouraging the growth of native water plants and the reestablishment of a thriving trout population.\nLlwytmor:\nStanding at 849m, our first hill translates to English as the 'Ash Sea', due to its flat grey boulder strewn summit. From the top, we'll have panoramic views over Anglesey, The Irish Sea, and even The Lake District and Isle of Man should the weather be clear.\nFoel-fras:\nAt 944m, our highest point during the walk translates to 'Broad Hill'. We'll again be greeted by stunning sea views to the North, as well as views of the Carneddau to the South. The mountain is also of ornithological interest, being one of the best places in Wales to see Dotterels on their spring migration, which also peaks the interest of upland raptors such as Peregrine Falcons.\nDrum:\nAt 771m, our final summit translates as 'Ridge', despite it being a very rounded hill. From here we'll get more sea views and mountain panoramas as we make our descent.\nThe Carneddau Ponies:\nDuring the walk, we may come across the wild ponies that inhabit the mountains. The ponies have lived here for hundreds of years, surviving by feeding on the native upland plants. If we do see them, make sure not to approach too closely, as they are wild and shouldn't be frightened.\nAber Falls Distillery:\nAt the end of the walk, we can visit the local distillery, which has a cafe, selling cakes, hot drinks, and of course, whiskey.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for a summer hike along the Dane Valley Way, through the countryside and nature reserves of Cheshire.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nThe Dane Valley Way:\nThis 77km long distance footpath follows the River Dane from Buxton to Northwich. We'll be walking along the section between Congleton and Holmes Chapel; hiking through a mix of farmland, woodland and wetland along the way.\nAstbury Mere Country Park:\nFormally a sand quarry, the country park was opened in 1991, and is now home to an impressive mere, where wetland birds and mammals live. The mere is also a large water sports and outdoor education facility, making it an import asset for locals.\nBrereton Heath Nature Reserve:\nThe reserve consists of mainly silver birch and oak woodland surrounding a large lake, as well as areas of heathland, a wildflower meadow and wetland areas. Many bird species live in the reserve, including great spotted woodpeckers, nuthatch, treecreepers, kingfisher, heron, great crested grebe and goldfinch. This will also be our lunch stop, with a farm shop onsite run by the local dairy farmers, selling homemade milkshakes and ice cream.\nSwettenham Village:\nThis lovely little village was founded in the 12th century, and also has an impressive 13th century church, St Peter's. Next to the village is the Lovel Quinta Arboretum, with a huge collection of trees and plants, some of which we'll be able to see as we walk around the village.\nHolmes Chapel:\nThis is where we'll end the walk. The village has another interesting old church, St Luke's, a grade 1 listed building dating to the 15th century. We'll also pass the impressive Hermitage Viaduct as we walk into the village. There a several pubs we can go to for post walk drinks.\nOther Information:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIf the event is fully booked, please join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event, meaning you're likely to get a place on the walk.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event will open for bookings on Friday 27th June. We are trialling delayed booking for all day walks in the Northeast and Yorkshire Region to reduce waiting lists and late cancellations. We know that a significant number of members who book places on our walks eventually decide not to attend the event. This causes long waiting lists and makes it harder for those who wish to attend an event to obtain a place. If you are interested in attending this event, please click the ‘bookmark’ button to add this page to your list of bookmarked events. This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nExplore the beauty of the Bradford district and celebrate\nBradford 2025 – UK City of Culture\nwith a circular walk taking in the stunning views and wildlife on Ilkley moor, as well as experiencing some of the archeologically significant secrets of the moorlands.\nWe'll begin from Ilkley, taking a circuitous route along the tarn to the\nCow and Calf rocks\n.

Next we'll visit other sites including the Thimble stones, Cowper's Cross, and the Badger Stones before wending our way to White Wells on the outcrop above Ilkley before descending back to town.\nThere’ll be an optional trip to a café at the end of the walk.\nDogs:\nWell-behaved, socialised and under-control dogs are welcome on this event.\nDogs should be kept on a lead whenever this is signposted and whenever we are in the vicinity of livestock, and at the event leader's request.

So we will likely chill on the beach for half an hour, and start walking towards Shoreham around 7pm. We will reach the Longshore pub within the hour, and stay there to eat, drink, and socialise.

Therefore numbers are limited due to capacity and I have booked us in.\nWe will take the ferry across the river (£2 payable per person), which may involve a wait.\nNo dogs are allowed due to the visits to Marble Hill House and Pembroke Lodge/Gardens.\nOverground and District Line closed that day, but accessible by mainline trains.\nThe route\nLeaving Richmond station, we’ll walk across the Green via the remains of the Palace to the River Thames. Following the busy river path, we’ll reach historic Marble Hill House for our visit and early lunch. We will cross using the foot ferry to Ham House, then head through Ham Common and Woods to enter Richmond Park. In the Park, we will take in Isabella Plantation, Pen Ponds and Pembroke Lodge Gardens and King Henry’s Mound. On the return to Richmond, we’ll stop to admire the views from Richmond Hill Terrace Gardens, before returning to the river and an optional pub stop in town.\nThe sights\nRichmond on Thames\nDespite being just 8 miles from London, Richmond preserves its character with an expansive green surrounded by Queen Anne and Georgian houses leading to an archway, which is all that remains of the former Palace. The Palace was rebuilt during the 1440s: Henry VII died here in 1509, Henry VIII used it until Hampton Court was acquired, it was given to Anne of Cleves and Queen Elizabeth I died here in 1603. Most of the Palace was demolished by 1660.\nMarble Hill House (visit included)\nhttps://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/marble-hill/\nPlease note we are booked in for a free flow visit (not guided), admission free. We will have 1 hour to explore\nwith time for an early lunch and you may wish to visit the gardens and cafe.\nWe will visit the Palladian Marble Hill House, which was built in 1702 for George II’s mistress Henrietta Howard. In her earlier life, her father had died in a duel, and her marriage was a disaster, but she rose to become the King’s official mistress with her own court. The restoration of the House and Park was completed by English Heritage in 2022.\nRiver Thames ferry and Ham\nThere is a £2 charge per person and we may need to queue to cross.\nWe will cross the Thames using the foot ferry.  We will see the outside of Ham House, which was built originally in 1610 following the gift of land by Charles I, and its interiors have hardly changed since then. Elizabeth, the daughter of the original owners, secretly helped Charles II in exile during the Civil War, but retained the house by keeping Oliver Cromwell on side. 17th century gardens have been recreated and surround the house, which we can see through the gates.\nWe will NOT visit the interior or gardens of Ham House (NT).\nRichmond Park\nRichmond Park was originally enclosed by eight miles of walls by Charles I, but public access was only secured in 1758 by John Lewis, a local brewer (not the retailer). There are over 600 deer, and the Isabella Plantation was created in the 1950s with streams, and a colourful collection of azaleas and rhododendrons. It’s London’s largest Royal park, largest Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve.\nAt Pembroke Lodge Gardens, we will visit King Henry’s Mound which boasts a 10 mile direct and protected view of St Paul’s Cathedral, enjoy the views over the Arcadian Thames, and look for Poet’s Corner with a bench dedicated to Ian Drury (“Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick” and “Reasons to be Cheerful”). There are two cafes here also.\nA map of the park can be seen here:\nhttps://www.royalparks.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/Richmond-Park…\nRichmond Terrace\nThe Royal Star and Garter Home adjoins the terrace and was built by funds (and jewels) donated by women as a memorial of men who went to war, opening in 1924.  The view from Richmond Hill is protected by Act of Parliament.\n“Here let us sweep\nThe boundless landscape... to where\nMajestic Windsor lifts his princely brow\nIn lovely contrast to this glorious view\nCalmly magnificent, then will we turn\nTo where the silver Thames first rural grows...\nHeavens! What a goodly prospect spreads around\nOf hills, and dales, and woods, and lawns and spires,\nAnd glittering towns, and gilded streams, till all\nThe stretching landscape into smoke decays.”\nFrom THE SEASONS, James Thomson\nThe route\n(please click the link to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website):\nhttps://explore.osmaps.com/route/22975802/richmond-marble-ham-and-park-updated\nDon't waste that space!\nSpring walks get really busy so please only book if you know you can make it.

    "Summary": "Start your weekend early, with a 6.5 mile circular mountain walk (800m ascent) from Threlkeld, including a Grade 1 scramble over Hall's Fell Ridge.\nYou  must  be comfortable using your hands and feet to move over complex, rocky terrain and have a good head for heights to complete this route.\nLooming over the A66 between Penrith and Keswick, Blencathra is a proper mountain.  Hall's Fell Ridge is a really interesting way to get to the highest point - Hall's Fell Top.  As Wainwright says: \"For active walkers and scramblers, this route is\npositively\nthe finest way to any mountain top in the district\".  Not as exposed as its more infamous neighbour, Sharp Edge, it is still a Grade 1 Scramble, albeit a relatively easy one. It can be made easier or harder depending on the line taken - if you follow the ridge line closely, it is a more difficult scramble but, if you take one of the lower by-pass paths, it is less challenging.  If you have never scrambled before, this could be a good one to try because of the flexibility.\nAfter warming up by walking across the lower slopes, we will start to climb steeply up Hall's Fell - at first, on a mountain path, but soon reaching the ridge and the scrambling section.  We will probably split the group into two for  this section with one group following the ridge line and the other taking the easier options.   Once we get to the top, we'll join back up and enjoy exploring the summit area and coast back down the easy graded path the car park, enjoying the views as we go.\nAt the end of the day, we'll go for an optional drink at the\nHorse & Farrier Inn\nin Threlkeld.\nYou can find the route\nhere\n.\nEvent full?\nPlease join the waiting list.  Places usually open up as the event gets nearer and, where necessary, we try to add additional leaders to increase the numbers, so you are highly likely to get a place.\nNew Members:\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event, do note that this walk is likely to require some experience. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nIs it dog friendly?\nEveryone's dog is different, but this walk unlikely to be suitable for most dogs due to the nature of the terrain.\nImage\n/\nphoto\ncredits\n:  All images (c) JPV with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "16",
    "Summary": "Waitlist\n:\nIf this event becomes fully booked, but if you'd like to attend,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the date, and you are likely to get one.\nThis is a moderately challenging 14 mile circular walk primarily exploring the Chiltern Hills and Hambleden Valley with a homecoming stretch along the Regatta Course section of the Thames Path. This will also be my first lead as a Lowland and Hill Walk Leader so please come along to support me!\nThe Sights:\nHenley-On-Thames:\nis a town renowned for its vibrant river life and Georgian architecture. The world famous Henley Royal Regatta will be commencing the week after this hike so no doubt preparations will be well underway\nHenley Park:\nis a historic country house and landscape garden, originally established in the 13th Century as a deer park. We will be walking through the parkland as we leave Henley-On-Thames\nStonor House And Deer Park:\nhas been the home of the Stonor family for 850 years, making it one of the oldest family residences still in use. The deer park is home to a herd of fallow deer. Although we won’t be visiting the house or Italianate-style gardens, we will still get views of the house and grounds may get to spot some deer\nSouthend:\nno seaside, pier or references to TOWIE here, this is a small and unremarkable hamlet (marking the halfway point and lunch stop) and is part of the parish of Turville, synonymous with The Vicar of Dibley\nHambleden:\nis a picturesque Bucks village known for its brick-and-flint cottages and has a rich history dating back to the Domesday Book of 1086. It’s a popular movie and TV film location with productions including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, 101 Dalmatians, Goodnight Mister Tom and Midsomer Murders. Option for tea, coffee and cake here at our three-quarter mark\nMill End And Hambleden Lock:\nwe access the Thames Path crossing a wide section of the river across a bridge and weir at Mill End to Hambleden lock, with views back to Hambleden Mill\nThames Path And Henley Royal Regatta Course:\nthe final stretch will include the world-famous rowing course measuring 1 mile and 550 yards over a straight racing line and in use since 1839. At the start of the course you’ll find Temple Island with its Etruscan-style temple designed by James Wyatt in 1771.\nHenley Royal Regatta:\nduring this period Henley hosts one of the highlights of the English summer social season with world-class rowing, elegant hospitality tents and a black-tie music festival. The regatta and festival will be commencing the following week, so as we return to Henley, you will see the various tents and stands being readied\nThe Route\nhere\n:\nStarting at Henley-On-Thames Railway Station we will briefly walk through the town headed for the Oxfordshire Way, taking us North-East, firstly up a steep hill and then a flat stroll through the parkland of Henley Park. Continuing along the Oxfordshire way we will eventually go steep downhill into Middle Assendon.\nFrom Middle Assendon we continue through roads, paths and tracks to Stonor, where we join the Shakespeare’s Way, following a steep uphill section skirting past Stonor House and Deer Park. After a long climb ascending 400 meters we will eventually reach the hamlet of Southend where we will stop for lunch.\nAfter lunch we continue on trails, with a number of wooded sections, to eventually arrive downhill into Hambleden, which is a scenic village and has a shop where we can get refreshments including tea, coffee and cake.\nFrom Hambleden, it’s flat for the remainder of the walk, firstly a meadow section following the Hamble Brook and finally we will follow the Thames Path back to Henley-On-Thames including the regatta course section. Optional pub visit to the Anchor Inn at the end!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are some stiles on route and sections along lanes and roads where there may be traffic and dogs will need to be kept on a lead. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nAll photos taken by the leader on different dates over the past 5 years and permission given to OutdoorLads for use.",

Originally composed to accompany a ballet of the same name, this musical series depicts various weather formations throughout the four seasons.\nAn epic finale to SSO’s 2024/2025 repertoire, the orchestra will be performing the magnificent Planets Suite by Holst, featuring some themes you will probably recognise. The most recognisable is arguably ‘Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity’ though keen ears will spot some of the other Planet themes too - both John Williams and Howard Shore took influence from the suite when composing music for ‘Star Wars’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’ respectively.\nTickets can be purchased online\non the SSO website\nan will also be available on the door. The cost is £12'.50. Concessions are available for students and unwaged.\nWe will go for a drink at a nearby pub after the concert.\nImage credits  Main Image - Andy Ling; Image 1 - Samual  Sianipar  (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 2: -Samuel Ramos (free to use under the unsplash license); Image 3  Mea Morrowhart (free to use under the unsplash license)\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The waterfalls of Clyngwyn are literally on our doorstep. Sgwd Clun Gwyn waterfall, the first of the falls on the Afon Mellte is only 500m from the farm so a short 5 minute walk away. We are close to the famous Sgwd Yr Eira waterfalls.\nOutside the bunkhouse there is a circular area with large fire pit and eating area (weather permitting) from where there are beautiful views of the Brecon Beacons. There's also a small stone built roofed building seating 6 people with a log burner. So we will have plenty of space both inside and out.\nOn Sunday we need to check out of the bunkhouse by 11am, but there may be the option to then head out for a Sunday walk and /or a pub lunch.\nDuties\nThe event is run by ODL volunteers who will need all participants to share in our domestic duties: food preparation, table setting and clearing, emptying bins, dishwashing, ongoing tidying of our space, cleaning of our dorms and bathrooms before departure.\nBedding\nBedding is provided for you, but don't forget to bring a towel.\nFriday Evening\n: Arrive anytime after 4pm, meet the rest of the group and socialise.

It's a perfect spot for hiking, chilling, and exploring.\nOn Saturday and Sunday we'll probably hike along the coast. Expect plenty of up and downs but also some spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way, with wooded valleys, rocky coves and stunning beaches including Slapton Sands and Blackpool Sands.\nThe spacious campsite was once used as an airfield by American marines to practice for the D-Day landings. Sadly the marines have long gone, but the campsite is in a great spot and we'll have our own field just for us! There's toilets, hot showers (20p for 5 mins), a small kitchen (with fridge) and washing up sinks. Camp fires and BBQs are allowed providing they are off the ground.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on the campsite but will need to be on a lead. Dogs are £1 a night, payable directly to the site on arrival. Well behaved OutdoorLads too please...this isn’t a party event and we'll need to be quiet after 11pm (the owners are super strict about this).\nThere's a couple of pubs a short stroll away and Slapton Sands beach is a further ten minutes down the road.  There’s a clothing optional beach too, if that’s your thing.\nPhotos:\nAll photos from OutdoorLads Members and permission is given for use by OutdoorLads.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement? Along the way, see some of the South East’s most beautiful countryside, dramatic hills and natural panoramas along the way. Look out for more of these walks around the South East over the coming months.\nThis route definitely plays into the ascent and decent aspect of the challenge, with two thirds of the route either ascending or descending the Watlington SE500 is up there when it comes to calorie burning!\nWe start the walk in the charming town of Watlington which is nestled in the scenic Chiltern Hills. The town boasts a history dating back to the 6th century, with medieval streets and historic buildings creating a unique atmosphere. Watlington Hill is a popular spot for nature enthusiasts, offering stunning views and ideal walking paths. The town has a growing reputation as a creative centre with a lively community of artists and musicians, hosting a range of annual events celebrating the arts, music, TV, and film, including Midsomer Murders, Inspector Morse, Poirot, Great Expectations, Sherlock Holmes, Philomena, and many more. Watlington is one of the few remaining market towns to have its own award-winning butchers, artisan chocolatiers, fresh fruit and vegetable market, florists, and boutique shops. This walk offers beautiful views and a variety of landscapes, including woodlands and open fields. The area is rich in history and natural beauty.\nThe\nroute\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are welcome on this walk, there will be livestock on route.

Check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\nFollow my ODL London Social Events on\nTelegram\n---\nFeedback from our London Social:\n\"it was my first ever event and I was super nervous walking in, but I was really welcomed, and ended up having a good evening, the guys were great. I heard about the ODL activities, I'm in!\"\n\"I don't live in London, but was down for work that day, so I came along. Brilliant to catch up with some of the lads I haven't seen in a long while\"\nPhotos:\nProvided by the leader and used with permission.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Indoor Climbing",
    "Places Left": "15",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "3",
    "Summary": "Come join OutdoorLads for indoor climbing in North London!\nAt the biggest climbing centre in North London, there are 450 routes over 95 lines set across 1000 square metres of wall offering top-roping, lead climbing and bouldering on a wide range of slabs, cracks, overhangs, off-widths and chimneys - there really is something to suit every level of climbing ability!\nI've never climbed before, can I come along? YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

    "Summary": "Change of date due to clash with London Pride - this event was 5th July, now 19th July.\nAt just over 14 miles, this day of walking is more challenging than your average walk. But you are rewarded with a lot of forest and a sense of being away from it all.\nWe'll start near the River Deben, and pass through beautiful Suffolk countryside before heading into the woods. Miles of pine forest await, as we make our way around the perimeter of an old airbase. We'll stop for lunch in a Forestry England car park where a refreshment van serves drinks and snacks for those who need them. We'll then continue our journey out of the forest, passing Gobblecock Cottage, where the forest opens up to acres of beautiful farmland.\nAs we near the end of the walk we will arrive at Sutton Hoo, the famous site of Anglo-Saxon burial mounds. We will have time to go up the viewing platform to take in the full view (all for free) but we will skip the visitor centre. We will then finish off with a final woodland walk back to where we began.\nThe day promises to deliver lovely settings, great company and tired legs! There may be an opportunity for a drink at the end of the walk for those who want to.\nIs it dog friendly?\nDogs are very welcome but they'll need to be fit and able to cope with 14 miles in their stride. Please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n).  Please also remember not everyone loves your dog as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nDon't waste that space\nBear in mind that both new and existing members are excited to be getting out more. So please only book if you know you can make it. Please note the relatively early start time and reasonably remote location too. Should your plans change, please free up the space immediately for someone else who could attend. And please always avoid booking multiple Outdoorlads events which are running at the same time.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"\nMy First Event\n\" section under \"About Us\".\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our Anglia* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFQJUXCw99c0mOHLiQ\n* Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire\nIMPORTANT for new members! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.\nGroup Chat\nWant to chat with everyone else coming in advance to help arrange lifts or plan the welcome buffet spread?\nClick here to join the Group Chat for the weekend",

    "Summary": "We’ll make our way through shaded woodland walks (the trees will be in leaf!), alongside rivers to open moorland.\nStarting in Yelverton I’ll take you south, briefly picking up the route of the old Plymouth/Dartmoor tramway, before heading into the Meavy valley. Continuing mainly through woodland alongside the disused Plymouth/Tavistock GWR railway downstream to Hoo Meavy, passing old copper mines, signs of charcoaling platforms and long abandoned head weirs for leats to provide water power to distant mines.\nFrom Lower Goodameavy we’ll ascend an outstanding example of an inclined plane (what’s left of it), pass the disused Dewerstone granite quarries, located in lovely temperate rainforest, before continuing to rise out of the woodland to summit Dewerstone Rock itself.\nAn open moor walk of a mile or so, offering views of the south west Dartmoor tors and no doubt an encounter with some of the Dartmoor ponies, brings us to Cadover Bridge. Lunch (maybe a paddle in the river) before we set off again following the River Plym back through woodland along the line of the old china clay slurry pipeline from Lee Moor. Passing the old workings of the Shaugh Prior clay drying kilns, we’ll drop down to the confluence of the rivers where there is yet more industrial heritage.\nA short upward walk along a back-road brings us out onto the open moorland of Roborough Common with views back to the Dewerstone and across the local farmland. Now a relatively level walk across the Common brings us to Drake’s Leat and thence (perhaps after an optional call into the Skylark Inn at Clearbrook) to the Dartmoor/Plymouth tramway. From there a flat walk takes us back to Yelverton.\nDogs\nDogs are welcome to join us on this event but we do ask the following:\nPlease appreciate the fact that not everyone is a dog owner or lover- especially when we stop to eat\nPlease ensure you adhere to the Countryside Code at all times - see (\nKeeping Dogs Under Effective Control)\nPlease also be aware of the\nrules and guidance from the Dartmoor National Park Authority\non visiting the moor with your dog\nIf your dog is uncontrolled and strays in open land frightening other animals or livestock, the leader is supported by the OutdoorLads board of trustees to ask you to leave the event as this is not acceptable behaviour.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Event Type": "Lowland and Hill Walks",
    "Places Left": "0",

    "People Attending": "40",
    "Summary": "When I checked out the area on a cold, bleak day in February, Chilling lived up to its name. When we stroll round the area on a lazy, hazy day in July, 'Chilling' will suggest relaxation. The only settlemen is Titchfield, far from bleak, which grew in prosperity in Georgian times as that of its Abbey dwindled, leaving the Earl of Southampton's ex-monastic mansion to be plundered for its stone. And on matters geological, the landscape is formed of Ice Age gravel outwash overlying sand, and this makes for a flat terrain which the sea and River Meon have quickly eroded. The Meon's mouth is a tiny, pretty harbour with a café, an ice cream van and a beach where we can have our lunch and a swim.\nThe sights:\nTitchfield Abbey:\nFounded in 1232 by Prémontré Abbey in France, the 'White Canons' lived a communal life observing monastic vows, farming the land, caring for the sick and preaching. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537, Henry VIII granted the abbey to his Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. The wealth of his new domain aided Wriothesley's ascent as a courtier, and he transformed the abbey into a handsome home. Wriothesley’s grandson Henry, 3rd Earl of Southampton, was a patron of Shakespeare, some of whose plays were premiered here. On the death of the 4th Earl, the abbey passed through several families, until 1781, when most of the building was demolished for building stone, leaving the gatehouse intact. It is free to enter. Nearby is Titchfield Great Barn, 48m long, in which the timbers have been dated to 1370.\nSt Peter's Church, Titchfield:\nEstablished 680, making it one of the oldest used churches in England. Though only a few parts of the original structure survive, the church contains a mixture of building styles. There is a sumptuous tomb to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, his son Henry, and grandson Henry, the patron of Shakespeare.\nTitchfield:\nLong a centre for business, with the town once having a small port. There were also tanneries, a market (in a fine market square), a fair, breweries, and craft workshops. A market hall was built in the Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early C17, but in 1970 it was bought, in a derelict state, by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. Titchfield is quite a gracious place.\nChilling and Brownwich Cliffs:\nPleistocene deposits (2.5 to 1 million years old) of gravel washed out from glaciers to the north overlies Eocene (50-40 million years old) sands and clays giving a flat relief to the area. These are unconsolidated rocks, easily eroded by the sea and rivers. The profile of the cliffs with gravel atop sand is obvious, with some disturbance of the gravel by ice wedges developing under periglacial conditions, a process called cryoturbation. Some erratics (rocks deposited by melting ice bergs) dot the beach, which are sarsen stones composed of sandstone, probably from Salisbury Plain.\nTitchfield Haven:\nThe estuary of the River Meon. The 'Visit Hampshire' website states: 'Titchfield Haven Nature Reserve is a wetland nature reserve with a rich habitat of rivers, marshlands and scrapes. It is excellent for birdwatching and attracts many people hoping to spot a rare species. From any of the eight easy-to-access viewing hides visitors can see all kinds of wildlife such as deer, foxes and wetland plants.' We will walk around the edge of the reserve, not entering it as a fee is charged, and still see many of these habitats. There is a shop, café and exhibition centre and nearby a small beach. The mouth of the Meon is controlled by lock gates and a small, pretty harbour has been created.\nTitchfield Canal:\nPossibly the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611. Close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. It was used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated although for a while Titchfield was a small inland port.\nSeawater quality:\nThe most recent bathing water quality at the bathing location was rated 'Excellent'. The water quality has always been deemed 'Good' or 'Excellent', but check\nhere\n(Environment Agency) or\nhere\n(Surfers Against Sewage).\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is very suitable for them. Dogs are permitted on Hill Head Beach which is where we'll have lunch and a swim. Drawbacks of the walk for dogs include some roads to walk along and cross which may be busy, and summer heat which could be exhausting for them. A dog off its lead must be obedient.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll go north up Mill Lane to see the abbey, then head back, using a footpath behind the recreation ground and crossing the A27 to enter Titchfield by an alleyway. We'll walk through the centre of Titchfield to Bellfield, then walk south along the canal to Great Posbrook Farm, where we'll go west along footpaths to Brownwich Lane, which will take us north to Warsash Road.

    "Title": "SE500 Challenge: Satanic Scenery - A Devilishly Fine Walk from Jumps to Punch Bowl",
    "Date": "Saturday Jun 21 2025",

    "People Attending": "34",
    "Summary": "And a quite diabolically demanding one too. This event covers two set-pieces of southwest Surrey scenery, both ascribed to Beelzebub because of their bizarre beauty: the huge wooded amphitheatre that is the Devil's Punch Bowl at Hindhead and the isolated outcrops of sandstone that are the Devil's Jumps at Churt. Surrey heathland and high-class suburbia connect the two. One extra highlight will be the decidedly un-dark, un-Satanic Barford Mill. The infernal inheritance of our Luciferan labours will be vast views, prodigious pride, cracking camaraderie and heightened health and happiness, and all gained without any pacts with the Prince of Darkness. Consult the forbidden lore below.\nSelections from the grimoire:\nBarford Mill:\nA pretty little mill on the stream that drains down Whitmoor Vale to Frensham Great Pond.\nThe Devil's Jumps:\nThree small hills, more prominent than their heights (around 120m) suggest, topped by crags of hard ironstone (sandstone). William Cobbett wrote about the Devil's Jumps in his\nRural Rides\n, first published in 1830, \"At Churt...three hills out upon the common, called the Devil's Jumps...in the shape of three rather squat sugar-loaves, along in a line upon this heath...with a rock-stone upon the top of one of them as big as a church tower.\" Back in the Jurassic Period, when layers of iron-rich greensand were laid down on a river delta, periodic floodwaters disturbed the beds, contorting them. As a result, the Jumps look to me like the ends of giant Cadbury's Flakes jutting from the ground. It was said that Mother Ludlam of Farnham (who was a witch) had her cauldron stolen by the Devil, who kicked up the hills as he made off with it.\nThe Devil's Punch Bowl and Hindhead Commons:\nThis is a large hollow of sandy heath, fringed with oak woodland and thronged with birdlife including redstart and wood warbler. Legend has it that the Devil tormented the god Thor by pelting him with enormous handfuls of earth, leaving the great ravine. In reality it was created by glacial meltwater percolating down through the sandstone until it hit an impervious layer of clay and so eroded the sandstone out. See more\nhere\n.\nWhat the Devil is SE500?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average Lowland and Hill Walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nHounds of Hell:\nThere'll be none of these on the walk, as dogs will be welcomed who are obedient and tolerant of walking along lanes and on leads when livestock are present. The walk could be exhausting for them in hot weather. Otherwise, it will be a great dog walk with abundant woodland and heathland for them to roam in.\nRoute 666\n(please click the\nlink\nto see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll follow Wey Hill west until Farnham Lane and The Avenue heading northwest to Lion Lane, where we'll leave the tarmac and cross Polecat, Craig's Wood and Nutcombe Down before using the footbridge over the A3 to Grayshott. A path along the edge of Whitmore Vale will take us to Beacon Hill and and Whitmore Vale Lane will take us to Barford Mill all the time heading northwest. At Kitts Lane, we'll turn east and follow Green Lane to Hale House Lane, then a track north to Jumps Road. After lunch on the jump and a drink at Bel and the Dragon, we'll follow Tilford Road south to Hyde Lane where a footpath will then take us from Hyde Hill to the Devil's Punch Bowl. At Coombe Head we'll go on to cross Bunch Lane down to Farnham Lane where we'll retrace our steps back to the station.\n(Image credits: The Devil's Punch Bowl, from the viewpoint: Photo ©\nMr James D\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Stony Jump, Surrey, England: Photo ©\nweesam2010 | Flickr\n(\ncc-by-nc-sa/2.0\n); Polecat Copse: Photo ©\nN Chadwick\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Coniferous woodland: Photo ©\nRobin Webster\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Whitmore Vale, Pondside: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Bell & The Dragon, Churt: early July 2024: Photo ©\nBasher Eyre\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Rocky terrain atop the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); View south east from the Devil’s Jumps: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Grazing by Highcomb Copse: Photo ©\nColin Smith\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Sun and Shade at the Devil's Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Looking down on the Devil’s Punch Bowl in Surrey: Photo ©\nPeter S\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "Please note the date change from 7 June to 9 August.\nJoin me on this spectacular circular walk from Lewes around the South Downs. After a steepish climb near the start, the walk offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and beyond.\nWhen I led this walk in 2023, it was a very hot day, and the majority of us ran out of water. Fortunately we found a water tap in a local church yard. Hopefully it will be cooler this time, but do remember your water!\nWhat is SE500 Challenge?\nSE500 is a series of challenging hill walks in the South East. They include 500 metres of ascent and a distance of around 20km (12.5 miles). Sometimes paths may be steep; other walks may include ups and downs. That’s more than the average lowland and hill walk, and great practice for a mountain! An average man can expect to burn 2000 calories on one of these walks. Why not build up your fitness and gain a sense of achievement?\nPlaces\nof interest\nLewes\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nSouth\nDowns\nNational\nPark\nThis is England's newest national park, designated on 31 March 2010, covering an area of 1,627 square kilometres (628 sq miles) and stretches for 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.\nOffham\nPronounced \"Oaf-um\", the \"new\" St. Peter's Church was built to replace the Church of Old St. Peter in 1840s. Offham hosts two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Clayton to Offham Escarpment and Offham Marshes.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see the route at the Ordnance Survey website)\nWe leave delightful Lewes and pass over the railway line and A27 to pick up Jugg's Road (track) which we follow past the windmill at Kingston Hollow. With a steepish climb of 197m, we're graced with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and the South Downs. After passing under the railway and over the A27 again, we climb Long Hill, where we'll stop for lunch, enjoying views of the surrounding countryside. We'll continue over Balmer Down and along the South Downs Way, before starting our gradual descent to the village of Offham. The walk then follows the River Ouse, and the outskirts of Lewes, climbing towards the castle before descending past The Fifteenth Century Bookshop and the quaint houses along Keere Street, and back to the station.\nPlease join me if you wish, for a drink at The Depot, next to the station.\nPlease note, the walk does not allow time to visit Lewes Castle.\nDogs\n:\nDogs are welcome but please note and abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and be prepared for a couple of stiles/hills on the walk. Please also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nIMPORTANT\n! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a weekend camping at Nantcol Waterfalls, nestled at the foot of the Rhinog mountains.\nFar less well known than the areas in the north of the\nEryri National Park\n, the Rhinogydd are a wild range of hills in central Snowdonia that are rougher than anything else south of Scotland.The Rhinog mountains are popular with hillwalkers looking for a more isolated, wilder walking experience and we plan to put on a strenuous walk to explore these hills properly.\nIf mountains aren't for you, Cwm Nantcol has beautiful woods and spectacular waterfalls to explore, and we're also not far from the beach.\nShowers -\nthe showers operate on a shower card system which allows a 5-minute shower per card. These cards will be issued to campers at Reception.\nCampfires\n- Nantcol Waterfalls allow campfires but the site is within a Tree Preservation Area and as such we can only allow the burning of manufactured logs – the collection of deadwood and live wood is not permitted. Fires require the use of Fire Baskets only, which can be bought on site or hired from Reception. We will sort a communal fire.\nMobile signal\n- signal is weak at this site but, if you're desperate to get online, you can pay for wifi access. Alternatively, if you venture 100 metres up the hill on the same side as the waterfalls you should obtain 4 bars from most signal providers.\nDogs\n- the site permits dogs with well behaved owners. There is a charge of £4 per dog for the weekend payable on arrival to the site in cash. Dogs must be on a lead at all times when on site as this is a sheep farm - no exceptions can be made.\nMusic\n- This campsite does not allow music to be played.\nSummit area of Aran Fawddwy and view to Rhinog range\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nAndrew Hill\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/5752120\nRhinog Fawr Trig\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nRude Health\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/3358007\nRhinog Fawr\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n- ©\nJohn Lucas\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4118611\nRemaining images courtesy of Bryan Cosgrove and of Nantcol Waterfalls Campsite\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Known for its picturesque high street lined with the distinctive stone buildings, Burford boasts a rich history dating back to the 12th century. We will climb \"The Hill\" to get a fantastic view of the main street through the town with the green hills in the background.\nWe will then follow the course of the river Windrush to the deserted medieval village of Widford - now just a few houses and the 13th-century St Oswald's church remaining.\nWe will stop off at the Swan Inn at Swinbrook for some riverside refreshments before the short walk back to the start at Asthall.\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome to come along but be mindful not everyone likes dogs as much as you might. There can be livestock around some fields we pass through, and Burford can be very busy with cars and people so dogs will need to be on a lead in these areas.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nWaitlist\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nImage / photo credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader in March 2025 with permission for ODL use.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Inside the underground nightclubs of Leeds, we meet fabulous characters who compete in elaborate categories to win glittering trophies to fulfil their inner fantasies as they’re socially shunned from the rest of the world.\nFrom colourful garments to Vogue dancing, ‘I AM BEAUTIFUL’ explores LGBTQ+ Ballroom Culture bounded with sexuality, gender, corruption and AIDS.\nJoin Outdoorlads members at this performance. There is an opportunity to join us for a fish and chip supper before the performance at the world's oldest fish and chip restaurant.  There is also an easy\nfour mile walk\nthat afternoon which has been designed to fit in with the performance.\nYou must purchase your\ntheatre ticket\nbefore the event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a 9-mile / 15 kilometre walk on the South West Coast Path, around the Isle of Portland!\nThis circular walk begins near the Olympic Rings and circumnavigates the island in an anti-clockwise direction. The route mostly follows the official South West Coast Path.  Ascent is around 340 metres, resulting from ups and downs along the way, and with a gradual rise from Portland Bill back to the Olympic Rings.\nHighlights of the walk include:\nOutstanding views from the top of West Cliff of\nChesil Beach\nand\nFleet Lagoon\n, which is the largest tidal lagoon in Britain.\nThe extensive fortification of the\nVerne Citadel\nwhich was built in the 19th century overlooking Portland Harbour, which it was built to defend.  If you’re interested in military architecture, there’s more info\nhere\n.\nThe “\npirate graveyard\n” at the ruined old church of Saint Andrew, so-called because of the skull-and-crossbones design which can be seen on a number of tombstones.\nPulpit Rock\nand\nPortland Bill\nat the southernmost tip of the island, from where spectacular views extend to Start Point in Devon and to Durlston Head in the east.  On a clear day, you can probably see more of the English south coast than from anywhere else.\nPortland Bill Lighthouse\n, which was built by Trinity House in 1906 to guide vessels heading for Portland and Weymouth and acts as a waymark for ships navigating the English Channel.  If you’re interested in lighthouses, there's more info\nhere\n.\nNear the end of the walk, the sculpture park at\nTout Quarry\nis a showcase of modern sculptures created in an old quarry. There’s more info\nhere\n.\nWe may meet other OutdoorLads along the way who are climbing on the Portland cliffs this weekend, if so we'll stop for a chat and maybe watch them climbing for a short while.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs are welcome on the walk, but must be under close control at all times and on a lead in the vicinity of livestock or where wildlife may be disturbed.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to join us, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the event date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Nestled in the central fells of the Lake District, our venue is a mountaineering cottage in Little Langdale.  Whilst basic, the cottage provides a great opportunity for a couple of days in the Lakes.  We are a stones throw away from the famous Slaters Bridge and Cathedral Cave.\nFrom the cottage are the nearby summits of Wetherlam, Swirl How, Lingmoor Fell, Pike O'Blisco, Cold Pike and many more.  For those wanting shorter or lower walks, the fantastic Blea Tarn and small Little Langdale Tarn are both nearby.  If you're not a fell walker then take a day trip to Ambleside where there are shops, tea rooms and Windermere ferries across the lake.\nA mountain walk will be our activity on Saturday, led by our great\nSieh\n. The walk will be decided based on weather closer to the time. But in Little Langdale we are on the doorstep of some of The Lakes' most extensive and lovely fells, and so we'll be aiming for a walk of approximately 10miles/16km and with around 800m of ascent (but avoiding anything too scary!) .  Other options, including lowland walks, will be left to individuals unless other leaders sign up and are willing to lead a walk.  On Sunday there may be optional activities before we say our goodbyes, we're on the doorstep of Cathedral Cave for example.\nFriday night will be the usual OutdoorLads buffet, please bring something to share.  Fridge space is\nvery\nlimited!  In order to reduce food waste, and to maximise space in the small kitchen, the event leader will send out a buffet sign up sheet before the event.  Saturday night will be a shared meal, cooked by the leader.  There isn't quite room for us all to sit around one table.\nThe cottage is basic, but they often provide the best memories! Conversation and community will be key to a great summer weekend. The mountaineering club has a good relationship with the cottages attached either side of ours, and we are keen to keep working with the club, so members are asked to keep noise to a suitable level (there won't be any loud music).  Don't let that put you off - you'll have a great weekend of hiking, chipping in with cooking, and being part of a cracking group of welcoming people.\nThe hut has two dorms, one for 6 and one for 10.  There are two hot electric showers.\nThere is parking for 6 cars so please do car share.  We cannot reiterate this enough, parking is very limited to 6 cars and we do not want to inconvenience the neighbours. Any further cars will have to park away from the cottage.\nDogs:\nThis event is not suitable for dogs.\nPhotos:\nUsed with permission from Rich Laverick and Flyde Mountaineering Club\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "PLEASE READ ALL SECTIONS, INCLUDING WHAT TO BRING AND FOOD & DRINK\nYou can find out more about wild camping on this page:\nMy first wild camping event\n. You need to have mountain walking experience, good equipment and a good level of fitness to carry your food, sleeping bag, sleeping mat and small tent or bivvy bag for around 80 km (50 miles). We’ll walk about 20km (12.5 miles) each day. Sometimes it will be easy walking, other times we’ll be crossing parts of Dartmoor where there are no paths, rivers with no easy crossing points and rough boggy ground. The route will be partially determined by the water levels on the moor; we may need to change the route or walk late into the evenings if water levels increase. We may need to camp on exposed, wet, uneven ground.\nDartmoor has the best preserved prehistoric landscape in north western Europe. There are remains of over 5000 roundhouses, over 1500 cairns, and a remarkable set of ceremonial monuments dating from the late Neolithic to early Bronze age, including over 20\nstone circles\nand over 75\nstone rows\n. This trek visits the most impressive of these monuments. The\nfour day linear route\ncrosses Dartmoor from north to south, from\nOkehampton\nto\nIvybridge\n. Participants will need to make their own transport arrangements to the start and from the end. Trains run from Exeter St David's to Okehampton and Ivybridge. If coming by car, leaving the car in Exeter looks to be the best option (see the Location section below for details).\nOn the first day we'll visit Nine Maiden's Stone Circle, Cosdon Stone Rows (the most impressive prehistoric triple stone row in Britain), White Moor Stone Circle, Buttern Hill Stone Circle, Scorhill Stone Circle (Devon's finest stone circle) and Shovel Down Stone Rows.\nOn the second day we'll visit Fernworthy Stone Circle, Assycombe Stone Row, The Grey Wethers Stone Circles, Postbridge (shop and visitor centre), Lakehead Hill Stone Row & Cist, and Wistman's Wood (one the highest oakwoods and last remaining temperate rainforests in Britain). Depending on progress we might stop at the pub in Merrivale at the end of the day.\nOn the third day we'll visit the Merrivale Stone Rows & Stone Circle, Hart Tor Stone Rows, Down Tor Stone Row, Yellowmead Concentric Stone Circle, Ringmoor Stone Row and Brisworthy Stone Circle. On the last day we'll visit Drizzle Combe Stone Rows, Grim's Grave Cairn Circle, Erme Valley Stone Row (3.4 km long, the longest prehistoric stone row in the world) and Stalldown Stone Row.\nImage / photo credits:\nPhotos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 19 © Patrick Revell, used with permission.\nAll other photos\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n:\nPhoto 6 ©\nChris Thomas-Atkin\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6359382\nPhoto 8 ©\nPete Cruse\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7990264\nPhoto 9 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406301\nPhoto 10 ©\nIan Capper\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/7090708\nPhoto 11 ©\nVieve Forward\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6131085\nPhoto 12 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6406389\nPhoto 13 and banner ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155589\nPhoto 14 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6404933\nPhoto 15 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410273\nPhoto 16 ©\nGuy Wareham\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/1911220\nPhoto 17 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6417803\nPhoto 18 ©\nChris Andrews\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/4155580\nPhoto 20 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6410089\nPhoto 21 ©\nSandy Gerrard\n-\ngeograph.org.uk/p/6409234\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "This event will open for bookings on August 15h. We are trialling delayed booking for all day walks in the Northeast and Yorkshire Region to reduce waiting lists and late cancellations. We know that a significant number of members who book places on our walks eventually decide not to attend the event. This causes long waiting lists and makes it harder for those who wish to attend an event to obtain a place. If you are interested in attending this event, please click the ‘bookmark’ button to add this page to your list of bookmarked events. This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.\nAn exploration of the Yorkshire Wolds in a much underrated area of Yorkshire approximately 20 miles east of the city of York, starting in the pretty village of Millington and visiting Givendale, Grimthorpe Wood, Mile Fields, Pocklington Woods and crossing the greens of the local golf course. Watch out for the balls!\nIt's a chance for a sociable walk where paths are mostly wide enough for two or more. It incorporates parts of the Yorkshire Wolds Way, Minster Way and Chalkland Way. This is a walk I'm repeating from previous years, and is my favourite route I can walk directly from home.\nThe route has some hills, but only a total height gain of 500m, however can be a little challenging on a hot day.\nFrom the top of the wolds at Millington you can get wide views across the vale of York, (on a clear day you can see as far as the White Horse at Kilburn at Sutton Bank almost 40 miles away). The walk also takes in some of the many pretty dales of the Yorkshire Wolds.\nThere is a chance for a tea stop about 3/4 way round or at the end of the walk if we're back early (there is also a pub in millington or a short drive away).\nIf you arrive early or forget your lunch, there is a Co-op and at least one cafe that opens early in Pocklington and there is free parking in available on a sunday. If you want to come via bus (East Yorkshire Motor Services, EYMS app shows times and routes), please message me or others for a lift from Pocklington, as there is no direct bus to Millington village.\nImage credits:\nall photos provided are taken by the event leader, and OutdoorLads has permission to use them.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "3 Nights - Friday to Monday\nYour event leaders Ian & Ste look forward to welcoming you to this stunning part of the Yorkshire Dales.\nVenture into the upper reaches of Swaledale for a three night stay in the scenic, quiet, less populated part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.\nThe campsite is both a working farm and brilliant well thought out site, with great facilities. The villages of Muker, Keld and Thwaite are not too far away, and all have either a pub or a nice teashop for those cream tea lovers! Did someone mention cream tea!!\nThere are several different easy lower routes branching out in deep cut valleys, well marked tracks ascending to the higher fells and many well used paths and bridleways for a decent selection of hiking and strolling options between villages.\nThe campsite sits in a narrow part of the valley close to a flowing beck with the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast National Trails only a short stroll away.  The main camping field has a gentle slope extending from the foot of the hill slope to the farm and facilities. The ground is well drained and the grass well managed for really good pitches. A quiet path avoids the roads to either of the two close villages a fifteen minute stroll away.\nThis is limestone country with waterfalls, limestone escarpments and deep gorges & wonderful wildflower meadows that carpet the landscape.\nGreat Shunner Fell, Kisdon and Lovely Seat are the nearest high ground and the steeper slopes offer picture postcard perspectives. There is plentiful evidence of mining here especially at Gunnerside Gill and the Cow'us (stone barns) are dotted about the drystone walled enclosures dating back hundreds of years.\nThere will be a small  selection of walks each day for those who like a challenge, or a mid level wander. If you would prefer to just relax and explore this area at a slower pace you are also welcome to join us here.\nWalk/activity options will be discussed at the event briefing on Friday evening once everyone has arrived & settled in etc.\nThe campsite facilities include lockers with phone charging, modern showers and plenty of toilets in a block in the centre of the site.  The on-site shop is well stocked with local produce and handy if you’ve forgot something.\nFire pits can be hired from the on-site shop along with firewood.\nIf you chose to bring a fire pit or BBQ then these must be raised off the ground, so to not damage the ground. Open fires are not permitted!\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to sign up as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nCampervans, Motorhomes, caravans:\nThese are permitted at no extra cost.\nDogs:\nThe site welcomes dogs as long as they are kept under close control as the camping field is beside the working farm.\nPhotos:\nThe photos used are courtesy of event leaders Steven & Ian and OutdoorLads member Craig B and are all used with their permission.\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to participate, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

This is an historic Victorian upmarket seaside resort visited by royalty back in the day and which famously only allowed its first pub in 2000.\nWe'll head from here along the beachside esplanade passing beach huts and all the way along to the more traditional British seaside resort of Walton-on-the-Naze. Complete with a pier, this has slightly more of a 'kiss me quick' atmosphere!\nWhen leaving Walton, our route will take us to the Naze Tower. Sitting on the Naze Cliffs, this is an 86ft high Grade II-listed tower built in 1720 for navigation. There'll be some time allocated for those wanting to go inside and climb the 111 steps, via some art gallery rooms; over the 5 floors and to the top viewing platform. There are great views of the sea and surrounding countryside from there.\nAn entrance fee of £4.50 per person for this payable there on the day.\nFrom here we will continue our walk along the sadly heavily eroded but fascinating coastline up to some surprisingly wild beaches and marshlands that make up the Naze Nature Reserve. Then looping our way back along some inland water ways and Titchmarsh Boating Marina before arriving back in Walton town.\nWe'll then head back along the seaside coastline, where there will be an opportunity to stop for ice cream and/or a customary ODL pint (or beverage of your choice!)\nThis walk is roughly 15.2km (9.5 miles) long and is relatively flat.\nIs it dog friendly?\nYes!! 4 legged friends are welcome, but please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and note that\ndogs aren't allowed in Naze Tower.\nPlease also remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so please be mindful of other members.\nNew Members\n- We would like to warmly welcome any newbies looking perhaps to try this as their first Outdoor Lads event.

The ferry is included in the event price.\nFind out more...\nYou can read more about the island and its history on the\nNational Trust's website\nand on\nWikipedia.\nThe\nNational Trust's access leaflet\nincluding a map is also available.\nDogs\nSadly dogs are not allowed on the island nor in the hostel.  If you need to bring an assistance dog for a disability please let us know so this can be arranged.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Places Left": "2",
    "Waitlist": "0",
    "People Attending": "48",
    "Summary": "Note: Please only join this event if you're happy to pay £5 to visit Lowfield Heath Windmill (pay closer to the day of the walk or on the day itself).\nWaitlist\n:\nThis event could become fully booked, but if you'd like to attend and there are no spaces left,\nplease add yourself to the waitlist.\nPlaces often become available closer to the day and you are likely to get one.\n...And other such aeolian/barometric clichés about success. The two main selling points of this walk are a private tour of Lowfield Heath Windmill, a Grade-II listed post mill of 1737, and a stretch at the end of Gatwick's runway where the planes seem to brush one's scalp as they ascend. Charlwood has over 80 listed buildings, including a church with extensive wall paintings from 1350, and central to which is a ghostly depiction of 'The Three Living and The Three Dead'. Upmarket suburbanisation and the roar of planes gaining or losing height may have erased most feeling of the past, but the views, woods and fields are charming, the low-flying planes exciting and what history remains, fascinating.\nThe sights:\nCapel:\n'One long and rather nondescript street along the [old] Worthing Road, a mixture of Weald cottages and the cheerful C19 brick of hamlets like Holmwood' (Ian Nairn:\nThe Buildings of England: Surrey\n). St John Baptist Church is C13, but rebuilt in 1865. Lots of good Weald farms from the C16 and C17.\nCharlwood:\n'A Weald village on the Sussex border, near Crawley New Town (and now even nearer to Gatwick...). Plenty of old cottages remain, both tile-hung and timber-framed, but the remoteness and sense of place have gone' (Nairn). St Nicholas Is Norman, with a C13 aisle and windows. Grade I-listed. Wall paintings from c.1350, which include the story of 'The Three Quick (Living) and the Three Dead' in which three proud young kings meet three skeletons as a\nmemento mori\n. A common Black Death-era trope and now quite faded. Large medieval rood screen.\nLowfield Heath Windmill:\nThe website says: 'The survival of Lowfield Heath Windmill is almost as remarkable as the story of its restoration in the hands of a dedicated and committed group of local people. The Mill was originally built at Lowfield Heath in 1737-8 and now stands on the edge of Charlwood village [it was moved when Gatwick's runways were extended]. It took thirteen years of hard work and great skill to dismantle, repair and re-erect the Mill. It has four floors, with an external staircase leading to the second floor, from where internal ladders rise to two further floors. It also has a small visitor centre within the roundhouse.' The windmill isn't normally open on the day of the walk but I have arranged with the manager for him to open it for us and provide tours in shifts during our lunchtime.\nGatwick Airport:\nThe second-busiest airport by total passenger traffic in the UK, after Heathrow, and the eighth busiest in Europe. It covers a total area of 674 hectares (1,670 acres). 'Gatwick' was from a farm, long lost, meaning 'goat farm'. The airport opened as an aerodrome in the late 1920s, and it has been in use for commercial flights since 1933, becoming a major airport in 1958. The airport has two terminals, North Terminal and South, and a single-runway which is 3316 metres long. A subsidiary runway is available but, due to its proximity to the main one, can only be used if the main runway is not in use. In February 2025, the government announced plans to move the secondary runway by 12 m north and open it to continuous use. Planes currently take off and land alternately. Although Gatwick is reportedly one of the worst in the UK for watching planes landing and taking off, a footpath we'll follow will allow great views.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link in red to see it at the Ordnance Survey website)\n:\nWe'll head east from Ockley Station along Coles Lane and cross the A24 in two goes as there is a wide grassy central reservation. We'll then follow The Street to Capel church where we'll proceed along Vicarage Lane. At Temple Lane we'll turn south before turning east and using footpaths to go from Aldhurst Farm to Tanhurst Farm. At the Rusper Road we'll continue east along Duke's Road. At Boothlands Farm, we'll pick up Charlwood Lane, then Russ Hill Lane to go to the windmill for lunch. At Charlwood Church we'll veer round and follow a path south, almost to Ifield. At Ifieldwood we'll follow a path west to The Manor Farm then Langhurst Farm almost to Rusper. Capel Road and then footpaths past Lyne Farm and Pleystowe Farm will take us north back to Capel where we'll walk down Coles Lane back to the station.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them (unless the weather is really hot), but there will be some stiles, busy roads and fields with sheep and cattle. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nIMPORTANT!

By the water, see if you can see an otter, or the blue flash of a kingfisher. There's a patchwork of history and archaeology, with prehistoric standing stones along the river, an abandoned medieval village nearby and the 17th-century packhorse bridge over the river at Malmsmead village.\nAs this is a National Trust campsite, the facilities are top-notch with clean and heated showers, and your typical National Trust camp shop.\nWe've reserved a designated 'patch' in the campsite so we'll all be camping together.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome at the campsite, although please note the National Trust's\nrules for dogs as listed on this site\nGroup Chat\nWant to chat with everyone else coming in advance to help arrange lifts or plan the welcome buffet spread?\nClick here to join the Group Chat for the weekend\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "The Isle of Wight has a character all of its own, and the rugged south of the island ('The Back') doubly so. The climate is almost subtropical, so glasshouse plants proliferate and bloom outside. The local sandstone is also distinct and so the cottages and churches look more like Dorset than Hampshire.\nThe Wee:\nThe retro Godshill Model Village, with the places we'll be seeing meticulously miniaturised.\nThe Twee:\nThe model village and the cottages orné of Shanklin Old Village - twee, but enjoyably so.\nThe Wowee:\nThe prettiest villages on the island (Godshill and Shanklin Old Village), the highest hill and best view likewise (St Boniface Down)(Plus, the 'aah factor': we'll drop in on the freebie Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary!)\nThe sights:\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary:\nThe\nwebsite\nstates:\n'\nThe Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary has 118 donkeys, 1 mule and 22 ponies, all of whom are either rescued or abandoned. They are given a ‘forever home’ in 55 acres of countryside in the Wroxall valley where they get first class care and welfare.' Admission is free but a donation is welcome.\nGodshill:\nThe show village of the island with its mellow church tower rising above immaculate thatched cottages. All Saints Church, mostly 15th-century, perched on a hilltop. Spacious interior adorned with some notable features: Medieval wall-painting of Christ on a 'lily cross' - one of only two in Europe; C18 monuments to the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe; big painting of\nDaniel in the Lions' Den\n, perhaps by Rubens.\nGodshill Model Village\n:\nThe tourist traps of Godshill and Shanklin Old Village reproduced at 1/10th scale. 'You can find all of our houses, cottages, churches and pubs in real life for a proper Gulliver [or Godzilla (Godshilla?)-suited] experience! Our models are fantastic replicas of these real buildings, made with sand and cement so they weather as they age. We even thatch them just like the real thing' (the website). The abundant conifers, trimmed to maintain scale, are equally notable. £7.00 to enter. We'll take the recommended 45 minutes to explore it over lunch, but if it's not your thing, you're welcome to go to the pub or explore the village and miss this quintessentially English piece of quirkiness.\nAppuldurcombe House:\nThe shell of a large and very fine C18 baroque mansion, built 1702-1740 for the Worsley family by John James. Requisitioned by the military and bombed by enemy action in 1943 and left a ruin. Managed by English Heritage. Freemantle Arch, 1770s, perhaps by James Wyatt. We won't be entering the house, just seeing the exterior.\nSt Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down:\nChalk hills rising to 241 metres, the island's highest point, In 1940 the radar station was bombed by Stukas, a scene reconstructed in the film\nThe Battle of Britain\n. Ecologically a rare juxtaposition of calcareous downland and acid grassland-heathland with acid-loving gorse, heather, bell heather and bilberry meeting alkaline-loving juniper and box. The cap of gravel supports a forest of holm oak. The views, south to the sea and north over the island to the mainland are truly stupendous.\nShanklin:\nA popular seaside resort with an esplanade lined with hotels and cafes and a sandy beach occupying a broad bay. The pier was lost in a storm in 1987.\nShanklin Old Village:\nA picturesque cluster of old cottages and Victorian cottages ornés, mostly now cafes, restaurants and touristy shops.\nShanklin Chine\n:\n'Chine' is a local term for a coastal ravine. Shanklin Chine contains waterfalls, trees and lush vegetation, with footpaths and walkways allowing access. Red squirrels are being supported and a section of PLUTO (PipeLine Under The Ocean), installed to supply petrol for the D-Day Landings, is visible. The Chine costs £8.50 to enter and doing so is optional.\nIsland Line Railway:\nNewly refurbished London Underground Class 484 trains (converted from D-78 stock) serve on the Island Line network. These replaced the 82-year-old Class 483 trains from 1938 that served on the island for 32 years until 2020.\nWightlink catamarans:\nHSC Wight Ryder I\nand\nHSC Wight Ryder II\nare high-speed craft in service from 2009. The sun deck makes the sea crossing great fun.\nThe\nroute\n(please click the link to the Ordnance Survey website to see the ascents and descents):\nShanklin's streets will soon give way to countryside via a converted railway line out to Lower Hyde and beyond. At Winstone Farm we'll leave the old railway and head west to the Donkey Sanctuary. Hitting the Stenbury Trail, we'll go into Godshill where we'll have just over an hour to see the model village and church and have lunch. Footpaths and the Worsley Trail will take us south and east out of Godshill to Appuldurcombe House. Footpaths and Rew Lane will then take us to Wroxall Down via Homelands Pit Farm. We'll cross Wroxall Down out to the antennae and then descend St Boniface Down and Bonchurch Down, heading towards the sea and finally reach Shanklin where an option is to descend Shanklin Chine before returning to the station to go back to Ryde.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on all my walks and this walk has plenty of open countryside and few lanes. However, it is quite long and hilly and may be too demanding for them in hot weather. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! – Participation Statement:\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

Other outdoor event leaders may book on to this course, but those required to complete the training will be prioritised should a waitlist develop.\nThis 16-hour outdoor first aid course deals with issues involved with the long term care of casualties in a remote setting. It is often referred to as a wilderness first aid or a remote first aid.\nThe outdoor first aid course includes primary and secondary surveys of a casualty, we also look at first aid equipment and how you may adapt and improvise your own equipment to support your first aid kit.\nA lot more emphasis is placed on incident management and relaying information to rescue teams in the outdoors. We assume minimal outdoor equipment is available and there are plenty of opportunities to practice first aid.\nThis 2 day (16 hour) course is recognised by the National Governing Bodies such as the Mountain Leader Training, British Canoe Union, British Cycling, British Association of Snowsport Instructors etc.\nEvent cost\nTo help us ensure that those that book on to this event are committed to it, we're asking Leaders to pay £15.

If you cancel before the event and we can fill your place, you will be refunded in full, but otherwise your booking on this event is subject to the\nOutdoorLads refund policy\n.\nOutdoorLads will subsidise your course fee, you are responsible for your own travel, food and accommodation costs. The course lasts for two days, starting early each morning and finishing in the evening each day and you are required to attend both days.\nPlease note that places on this are for leaders, and those who have already applied to become leaders.

The best moments usually occur if a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).\nChallenge yourself to\nwalk a marathon\nthrough the Derbyshire White Peak: literally a marathon length walk of 42 km (26 miles) with 1000 metres of ascent within about 13 hours.\nFrom Ambergate we walk up to\nCrich\n, through Leashaw Wood to High Peak Junction where we will stop for morning refreshments.

A section of the route involves a short stretch along an unsurfaced bridleway, but it’s easily rideable and avoids the busy A-road running parallel.\nNext stop will be Pocklington, a small market town and perhaps a good place to stop for a cream tea. Pocklington marks the beginning of the\nYorkshire Wolds\n, a superb yet relatively quiet cycling area. The next ten miles of riding are among the best on the whole route, tiny lanes nestling in narrow dales.\nWe'll stop for a pub lunch in the Wolds - probably in Millington or Huggate - before we head on through Driffield to our destination in Bridlington on the\nNorth Sea\ncoast.\nFor those with time, or staying the night in Bridlington, a short (7km) ride will take us further along the coast to Flamborough Head lighthouses, via Sewerby Hall.\nThe cycle will be\nslightly\nless challenging than the first two days:\n94km (58 miles) with 470m (1541ft) of elevation\n, but you'll still need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  For those who do not need to rush off, we will cycle on to Flamborough Head, which is another 8km. The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(or\nhere\nincluding Flamborough Head).\n**\nIf you're not planning to head straight home when we finish for the day, you will need to book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in Bridlington. Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn.\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1:\nPublic Domain\n; Image 2-4: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 5: Bridlington Sea Front\n© Nicholas Hutton and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n.",

We head out of town along the Wharfe River past Burnsall before a tough climb up from Appletreewick to Greenhow Hill.\nThe cycle route down to\nPateley Bridge\nfrom there on the B-Road is twisty and steep, with traffic. An alternative is to bypass the section on a quieter and less-trafficked, but still steep (down) in places country lane.  We can decide on the day what we'd prefer.\nPateley Bridge is the perfect place to stop for a cream tea, and to refuel for the next climb. It's also the home of the\nOldest Sweet Shop in the World\n- super sour fizz balls, anyone?  The road out of town leads to\nBrimham Rocks\n, a National Trust-owned property with weird and wonderful rock formations we may briefly cycle through.\n8km further on we cycle through the grounds of the stunning\nFountains Abbey\nWorld Heritage Site - a stunning assembly of history: the ruined Cistercian abbey, the landscape gardens, the medieval deer park before reaching\nRipon\n, where we'll stop for lunch. (A 10km shorter route bypasses Fountains Abbey and Ripon, with lunch in Bishop Monkton instead - we'll decide before we set off which route to take).\nAfter lunch the Way of the Roses meanders down the Ouse River valley, along quiet country lanes before crossing the Ouse on the rickety Aldwark Toll Bridge, which is free for cyclists.  The route is almost entirely flat between Ripon and York, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n98km (61 miles) with 890m (2,919ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as the whole distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n(Shorter route on\nCycle.Travel here\n).\n**\nYou will need to book your own accommodation in York, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in York.  Skip plans to stay at the Premier Inn City Centre (Layerthorpe).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should they arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL; Image 6: Aldwark Toll Bridge\n© Andrew Whale and licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; all other images Pixabay Public Domain.",

    "Summary": "The\nWay of the Roses\nis a three-day 'coast-to-coast' linear road cycling event.\nThe Wars of the Roses were a series of dynastic civil wars in the 15th Century fought for control of the throne of England between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster, represented by a red rose, and the House of York, represented by a white rose.\nThe 280km / 175 mile\nWay of the Roses\ncycle\nroute is almost entirely on quiet roads and tarmac paths, from the Irish Sea through the valleys of Lancashire, the Yorkshire Dales and the lovely, but little-visited Yorkshire Wolds, to the North Sea coast at Bridlington.\nTradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the Irish Sea and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the North Sea at the finish.\nWay of the Roses Day 1 - Morecambe to Grassington - 84km (52 miles)\nWay of the Roses Day 2\n- Grassington to York - 98km (61 miles)\nWay of the Roses Day 3\n- York to Bridlington / Flamborough - 94km (58 miles) / 102km (63 miles)\nOur journey starts in Morecambe, home to the UK's largest tidal estuary, Morecambe Bay. We'll meet on the seafront at the Way of the Roses start / end sign for the obligatory photo, before setting off for the east coast.\nAlthough called the\nWay of the Roses\n, only 19 miles (30km) of the 175-mile (280km) route is in the red rose county of Lancashire, before it heads into white rose Yorkshire. We skirt the top of the\nForest of Bowland\n, perhaps making a quick side trip to see the\nGreat Stone of Fourstones\n, before stopping for a pub lunch in Clapham or\nSettle\n.\nAny coast-to-coast route is going to involve some hills.  The good news is that the Way of the Roses is much kinder than many routes.  However, the climb out of Settle is crazy steep . . . and cobbled.  But it’s also pretty short; the main action is over in half a mile, after which you can take in the views of the Yorkshire Dales.\nWe head further east through the Dales before finishing up in Grassington, where we spend the night.\nThe cycle will be challenging:\n84km (52 miles) with 1,200 (3,609ft) of elevation.\nYou'll need to be a confident road cyclist, as a lot of the distance is on-road (albeit mostly relatively quiet country roads).  The proposed route can be viewed and the GPX downloaded from\nCycle.travel here\n.\n**\nYou will need to carry all your kit and book your own accommodation, to suit your own tastes and budget, with a variety of options to choose from in and around Grassington.  Skip plans to stay at the Old Hall Inn in Threshfield (1.5km outside Grassington).\n**\nPlease ensure that your bike is roadworthy before the ride, as you will be responsible for dealing with your own mechanical issues, should any arise.\nA “Way of the Roses 2025\" WhatsApp group has been set up.\nIt's an easy way to chat to the other attendees ahead of the event about kit and accommodation, and during the event.\nSee 'Location' info below for link to the WhatsApp group.\nIf you have any questions about the event or the route please contact\nSkip\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou\nMUST\ncomplete the\nCycling Participation Statement\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending a cycling event.\nYou only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each cycling event you attend.\nOutdoorLads Cycling Events Calendar\nYou can go directly to our cycling events calendar pages by bookmarking the follow link:\nNational Cycling Calendar\nfor all cycling events (Leisure, Road, Gravel, and MTB)\nImage Credits:\nImage 1, 4, 5 and 6: Pixabay Public Domain; Image 2: First Way of the Roses Waymarker ©\nAntiquary\nand licensed for\nreuse\nunder this\nCreative Commons Licence\n; Image 3: provided by ODL member and permission for its use and reuse is granted to ODL.",

    "Summary": "Gosaikunda Trek and Raft Expedition\nOur Gosaikunda trekking and rafting expedition offers a little bit of everything Nepal has to offer neatly packaged into a two week expedition. We will trek off the beaten track for seven days from the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley into the stunning Langtang region of Nepal.\nThe trek starts at Sundarija just a short drive from Kathmandu. It enters the mountains through the Shivapuri National Park before crossing the Lauribina pass at 4,610m. This the site of the sacred Gosaikunda lakes; a Hindu pilgrimage site linked to Shiva’s trident.\nWe descend from Gosaikunda to the next phase of the expedition on the Trisuli river which is a 4-hour drive from the end of the trek.. We spend two days rafting on the Trisuli river and then travel to Chitwan National Park. Here it is possible to see elephants, crocodiles, rhino and perhaps a tiger. After two nights in Chitwan we fly back to Kathmandu on an internal flight.\nOutdoorLads has organised this expedition to see the most thrilling locations Nepal has to offer with minimal time spent on long bus journeys. It offers a chance to get off the beaten track and really get to know Nepal.\nOur trip organizer (and OutdoorLads Member) Nick Read, is a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs Pride Expeditions.  He has led an OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and 2017 and a raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012. The last trek and raft trip in Nepal ran in November 2018 with a large group from OutdoorLads and was loved by all who took part. It created memories and friends that will be treasured for many years.\nITINERARY\nDay 1 Sunday 2nd November 2025\nArrival in Kathmandu (at anytime you want)\nToday you will be welcomed at the airport and transferred to your accommodation in Kathmandu approximately half an hour’s drive from the airport.
