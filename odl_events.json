    "Summary": "Come join OutdoorLads for indoor climbing in North London!\nAt the biggest climbing centre in North London, there are 450 routes over 95 lines set across 1000 square metres of wall offering top-roping, lead climbing and bouldering on a wide range of slabs, cracks, overhangs, off-widths and chimneys - there really is something to suit every level of climbing ability!\nI've never climbed before, can I come along? YES- but contact the Event Leader (see below)!\nSupervised sessions\nIf you're unsure whether you need to be signed in as a supervised climber or not, if you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as an unsupervised climber:\n1. Can you fit a climbing harness correctly?\n2. Can you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\n3. Can you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page, and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the centre when you arrive.\nSee below.\nAlso to make climbing more accessible, the Castle has kindly provided us with some group benefits:\nIf you are climbing with the group, tell the reception when paying for entry and you will get the concession rate. That's £11.50 instead of £16.50 for full price entry!\nFor those in need of financial support, we have access to some free entries. Speak to the Event Leader about how this works. We need to provide to the Castle some basic details (name, DoB, email) 48 hours before the session.\nTokens are available for free shoe or harness hire. We have two ODL harnesses that we can lend beginners climbing with the group- so get the free hire shoes!\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time,\neither as an experienced climber or beginner,\nplease send a note to the Event Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals.\nThere is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we  need to ensure there are enough experienced climbings to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment. Give it a go!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing on these Tuesdays. If you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their safety video and can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. And definitely come join us afterwards in the pub.\nParticipation Statement\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nBefore attending an OutdoorLads event, you MUST complete this\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space.

    "Summary": "This walk is something of Rainbow Heritage pilgrimage to see a lost haunt of the gay community from the 1970's, The Pavilion.\nThis walk is almost entirely flat, following the River Trent, then the Trent and Mersey canal into Shardlow, we'll stop for a drink at the Navigation Pub, used by the 'Bona Ome' club to test the waters before settling on their permanent club location.  Then take a gentle walk back to Trent Lock.\nGay History\nIn the late sixties some local people were investigating various potential venues to see whether any would work as a base for a gay club. They settled on adapting a cricket pavilion in Shardlow. The location had two merits: firstly, it was equidistant between Nottingham, Derby and Leicester; secondly, its out-of-the-way position gave comfort to a lot of people who were very closeted. The residents of Shardlow soon sussed the nature of the club and called it the “Handbag Club”. It ran – with some ups and downs – until 1983, when it was burned down by a fire which was probably caused by an electrical fault.\nThe Pavilion Club in Shardlow was the final destination of a pub night called the 'Bona Ome' club which was tried out in several pubs in places like Langley Mill and Sneinton and also in the Navigation Pub at Shardlow.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage Credits:\nAll images supplied by event leader and their use by ODL is permitted.",

Whether you're new to OutdoorLads or a seasoned pro, this is the perfect chance to meet new people, catch up with old friends, and enjoy the buzz of a new spot in town.

One of the unique aspects is the ability to choose from 4 doughs as part of the pizza base including the unique charcoal flavoured one. The venue offers a choice of toppings including a vegan option and also serves beer, wine and soft drinks. This should be a reasonably quiet venue, as it's a small one, enabling good conversation without a lot of background noise. More details about the venue can be found\nhere\nNew to OutdoorLads?

Whether you're unsure if it's your scene or you're wondering if it's the right fit—just come along! We’re a friendly bunch, and everyone’s welcome.\nNew Year Empty Feeling\nAfter all of the festivities of the Christmas and New Year period have come to an end and it's time to get back to work and those normal routines resume, January can feel like a long and uneventful month whilst we are still enduring the middle of winter. It’s easy to feel a little more isolated at this time of the year so that’s why these social events are so important! They’re the perfect way to stay connected, meet new people, and share optimism about what you are planning in 2026.\nNew Members\nPlease feel free to join this as your first OutdoorLads event. If you have any questions then feel free to message me, or go to the \"My First Event\" section under \"About Us\".\nAny Questions\nFeel free to text or WhatsApp me on 0755 4503371.\nWant to Get Out More?\nTo be informed of all our North West Home Counties* events please click on this Telegram link\nhttps://t.me/+EoB--tkEV3s4ZWJk\n* Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire",

    "Summary": "Got a New Year's resolution to take on a new challenge?  Fancying something to train for to get fit?  Or just a bit mad and like walking a long way in some beautiful Lakeland scenery?\nWell, this event could be for you - the Keswick to Barrow Challenge is back for 2026!\nWhat is it?\nWell, it's a very long walk - approximately 40 miles from just outside Keswick to Barrow-in-Furness with about 2000m of climb (spread out over a long way - it's not a mountain walk, don't worry!)\nBut it's more than that...\nIt's a charity fundraiser - we'll be collecting sponsorship to split between OutdoorLads and other charities nominated by the K2B Foundation who organise the event as well as the costs of running the event.\nIt's a massive achievement  - when you cross the finish line you'll feel amazing (and maybe think about doing it again next year?)\nIt's a huge event - with teams from all over the country, both smaller ones like ours and from big companies, fundraising for all manner of different charities.\nCan I actually do that?\nIt might be a long way - but as a bit of a veteran of quite a few endurance events your leader has every confidence!  You will want to do some training, though, few people can manage this sort of thing without.  Unsurprisingly the best form of training for walking is more walking...so why not sign up for some ODL walks and build up your distance!  There's no need to do super-long distances in training, though, just plenty of walking and be sure to try out any kit you're planning on using on the day.\nThe team\nThere's a minimum team size of 4 for the event (but we can enter more and we hope we will!) - however that's more for administrative reasons and we don't have to walk together throughout the event, so whether you're an accomplished ultramarathon runner and reckon you'll get round in 5 hours, or whether you're a walker who'd rather enjoy the scenery and take all day, it's all good.  If people do want to walk together that's also great, though, and we can provide each other some support along the way - there'll be plenty of time to talk about things like that on the run-up to the event.  Either way, you'll never be on your own with the hundreds of others taking part!\nAccommodation\nIf you live locally and can get dropped off at the start at the crack of dawn you don't necessarily need accommodation.  However for the rest of us we typically look at accommodation for the weekend in Barrow so there isn't far to go at the end of the walk (you'll probably not be in a fit state to drive anywhere!).  In previous years the Premier Inn (where your leader is staying) and Travelodge have offered good options but there's lots available so you can pick somewhere that suits your budget etc.  Don't book Saturday breakfast - you'll be up and out far too early for that :)\nWe usually meet up for a meal and a drink or two on the Friday early evening before a reasonably early night before the walk (and some walk related admin e.g. giving numbers out) - likely this will be near the Premier Inn but we can work that out depending on where people are staying.\nGetting to the start\nThe organisers provide what they call a \"Happy Bus\" coach service from many of the Barrow hotels to get you to the start - this leaves in the early hours of Saturday morning (3-4am!) which might be where the name came from (er!) - this is bookable at a small charge later on.  You can also have someone drop you off at the start if you have someone to do that but there is no parking available there so we do recommend the bus.  There isn't a bus the other way which is why we tend to stay in Barrow (also it tends to be a lot cheaper than Keswick for hotels etc).\nFundraising\nEach walker needs to raise £80 to take part in the event as a minimum, which is to be donated via the K2B website and not other sites e.g. JustGiving.  You'll get a personalised link to raise sponsorship which you can send out to as many people as possible to help reach your target!\nSounds great - how do I sign up?\nThere are a few things you'll need to do to get signed up:\nRegister an account on the K2B website at the below link and message the leader your Member ID so I can add you to the team when it has been set up.  If you already have a registration from previous years you can use the same one, you don't need to create a new one.\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/user/register\nSign up to this event page.\nOnce I've confirmed we have a minimum team of 4 signed up, book accommodation (this is at your own cost).  As prices can and do go up as the event approaches, it might be worth doing this sooner if there are suitable refundable options.  The leader is staying in the Premier Inn in Barrow but there are plenty of other options if that's not to your taste.  Don't book Saturday breakfast as you'll be leaving way too early for that!\nWhen looking for accommodation note the bus pickups are really early (around 3-4am).  The event buses do serve places other than Barrow itself but you'd need to get yourself from Barrow back to those places after the walk.\nNote that if we only have 4 and someone drops out that doesn't stop us walking - we just need a minimum of 4 signed up to confirm the team.\n(Provisional bus information:\nhttps://keswick2barrow.co.uk/happy-buses\n)\nYou will then need to pay your entry fee which is £15, and book your bus seat at £10.\nOnce we have the team all set up you'll be able to start collecting sponsorship via your own page on the K2B website - good luck!\nRemember there is a minimum commitment to raise £80 to be allowed to walk\n- this is the K2B's rule, not ours - so start in plenty of time :)\nDogs\nDogs are allowed on the K2B event itself BUT are not allowed on the event buses nor in most hotels, so if you intend to bring one (make sure it can walk 40 miles!) you will need to check arrangements carefully and arrange your own transport to the start (noting again that it's drop-off only, no parking is allowed anywhere near the start).  Dogs are allowed on the field at the finish but must be on a lead.\nObviously assistance dogs are allowed should you require one for a disability but please let the leader know if you are bringing an assistance dog so I can let the organisers know.\nPhoto credits\nThe photos on this event page were taken by previous participants/leaders including Danny McKeown-Henshall and are used with permission.",

    "Summary": "This bouldering session presents an ideal opportunity for a fun evening of what I call sociable workout where we take on a wide range of physical (and in fact mental) challenges with the atmosphere always friendly and cheerful. All levels are welcome!\nThe beauty of bouldering lies in its simplicity: you don't need ropes or a harness, just some climbing shoes which can be hired at the centre and a drive to get the top and overcome some trepidation. It's also a fundamentally social experience, with most of the session spent discussing how to solve particular climbing routes, aka problems, or catching up with each other in between climbs. Bouldering is a great way to get into climbing, come and see what all the fuss is about!\nAll skill levels are welcome\n. If you're new to climbing, we've got you covered with tailored guidance, boosting your skills and confidence while ensuring your safety on and around the wall. Don’t worry about needing to invest in gear before you try. The Climbing Hangar offers\nfree shoe rentals\nso you don’t have to shell out for shoes until you know bouldering is for you.\nExperienced boulderer? Dive in and embrace the challenges independently. Just remember to follow the centre's rules for your own safety.\nOur ethos is inclusivity.

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads at Nottingham Climbing Centre\nClimbing evenings are held regularly and we tend to go to the local pub – The Lion for refreshments and a social gathering afterwards where they have a wide variety of beverages both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices. We ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive)\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n-     Hire a harness (again, if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n-     Hire shoes and harness - £6.00*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nCan I just come along and boulder?\nAbsolutely! Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Join us for a winter walk through the woodlands of Alderley Edge, and the surrounding countryside, in search of the legendary Wizard!\nThis is a circular walk of 7.5 miles / 12 kilometres, with 325 metres of ascent.\nThe route takes us past the Wizard's well and the \"Iron Gates\" which are said to be the gateway to a secret cavern under the hill.\nThe walk starts and finishes in the centre of Alderley Edge village, so is easily accessible by train from Manchester and from the south\n.\nThe legend of the Wizard of Alderley Edge\nis the story of a king and his sleeping knights who rest beneath the hill, waiting for the day when they will awake to fight the final battle to save the world. According to legend, each knight has a horse - pure white in colour. However, when the knights were placed in their enchanted sleep, the wizard whose job it was to watch over the king and his men found that they lacked one horse. One day, a long time ago, he encountered a local farmer taking a pure white mare to sell at the market.  After the farmer's initial refusal to sell, the wizard bought the horse and the farmer was paid a generous price in gold from the king's secret store of treasure under the Edge.\nWhilst the Wizard may be legend, there is no disputing the fact that\nAlderley Edge\nis a great location for walking.  The Edge is a dramatic red sandstone escarpment, clothed with attractive woodlands.  It rises from the Cheshire plain with impressive views west, north to the city of Manchester and to the Pennines beyond.  There is a long and fascinating history of small-scale\ncopper mining\nin the area, with activity dating back to the\nBronze Age\n.  Mining continued intermittently from Roman times to the 1920s.  Below the Edge and the surrounding countryside lies an extensive network of underground natural caves and mines.\nDogs\n: well-behaved dogs may come on the walk, but must be under control at all times and on a lead when walking through fields with livestock or where wildlife might be disturbed.\nWe will be walking through fields with sheep and cows in them so if your dog gets excited by livestock, this walk is not for them!\nWaitlist\n: if this event is fully booked and you want to come, just add yourself to the wait list because places usually become available closer to the date.\nPhoto credits\n: photos by the event leader with permission given to OutdoorLads for their use.",

NB If then hydro plant is taking water higher up for power generation, the falls will be reduced in power, but we'll be very unlucky for this to happen.\nThe walk continues down through beautiful mixed woodland eventually arriving at the side of Loch Ness. We follow the shore a short way before beginning our ascent, but not before we pass some intriguing huts by the loch and a memorial.\nThere is a cafe at the start / finish so hopefully it will be open and we can have a brew / cake before all heading home.\nWhy note join us on Saturday for a walk too?\nLoch Ness 1: Beautiful woodland, loch views and waterfall | OutdoorLads\nAnd on Saturday evening for a social event:\nInverness Social | OutdoorLads\nPhotos\n- all photos taken by Rob Mitchell and used with permission.\nDogs\nare welcome.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

Stats wise, the total ascent is approaching 300m or 1000ft, which involves quite a bit of undulation, although the return from the falls is all downhill!\nWe follow a range of footpaths through impressive Craigmonie woodland, many fine old broadleaf trees. Sadly a fair few have been damaged or completely toppled by the storms in 2025, but the whole area features much regeneration with removal of forestry pines and replating with mixed woodland. This will give wildlife of all kinds a boost: insects, birds mammals. There are woodpeckers (springtime) and pine martens although we would be extremely lucky to see one.\nWe will be on good forest tracks and minor tarmac roads.\nWe will be visiting the Divach Falls which has a viewing platform. After heavy rains, they will be more impressive (stating the obvious here). After the Falls, we return to the road and follow it almost all downhill beck to the start.\nWe should be able to find a suitable establishment for a brew before we head off and - for those who are joining us for the social in Inverness - time to freshen up and put on our glad-rags / festive jumpers / kilts or whatever we fancy.\nDogs\nare very welcome on the walk.\nPhotos:\nRob Mitchell and used with permission.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

On a clear night the Iights of the\nIsle of Man, Liverpool\nand\nBlackpool\nare clearly visible.\nEven if you've walked the Great Orme before, night hiking gives you a great way to see everything in a different light. We'll seek out vantage points to ensure we get a cracking night view of\nLlandudno.\nIf you haven't given night hiking a go before this walk should make a good introduction and is a good way to avoid the pubs/bars on a\nSaturday night\n, plus burn off some of the excesses of Christmas.\nImage / photo credits: All leader's own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nPlease be advised that the person leading this night hike has experience in night walking and has undertaken many similar excursions on the Great Orme in the past. While they possess a certain level of proficiency and familiarity with the terrain, it is crucial to note that they are not considered experts in nocturnal outdoor activities.\nNight hiking poses its own set of challenges, including reduced visibility and potential changes in terrain perception. The event leader is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience but participants should be aware of the inherent risks associated with venturing into natural environments after dark.

    "Summary": "There’s a particular magic to a January walk across heathland. The piercing air, the palette of pewter and bronze and steel, the promise of a fresh start. As we move through russet heather and dun grasses, the limitless sky echoes our New Year’s resolve to be more active, more connected, more open to community. The occasional Dartford warbler reminds us that even in winter, life finds a way. The chill begins to gnaw, but the thought of a cosy pub in the historic village of Thursley spurs us on: steaming plates, open fires, shared laughter. It'll be a perfect reminder of what OutdoorLads embodies: turning exertion into excitement and celebrating our common countryside and culture.\nThe sights:\nWitley Common\n:\nAn area of woodland and heath, and an SSSI. It features Bronze Age burial mounds and has been used as common land by many generations. During World War II it was home to 20,000 soldiers prior to D-Day. Today it is managed by the National Trust to provide a mixture of habitats for wildlife.\nThursley and Ockley Commons:\nAnother SSSI and National Nature Reserve. Crossbill, red kite, woodlark and stonechat are seen regularly, and Dartford warbler, whinchat, wheatear, redstart and tree pipit may be. The series of ponds, linked by a boardwalk, are especially biodiverse.\nThursley:\nAn immaculate and unsuburbanised village. The Norse name and origins of the place are interesting: 'Thor's Lee', and the village sign depicts the god wielding his hammer. St Michael's Church is almost all new after a restoration in 1860, but C12 and C13 century fragments remain. In he churchyard is a stone in memory of a sailor who was travelling to Portsmouth but was murdered by three villains at Hindhead in 1786. The murderers were caught and hanged before their remains were gibbeted at Hindhead. The cottages in the village are among the best in Surrey, for instance Olde Hall and Wheeler's Farm are C17, and Badgers and Vine Cottage are early C18. Horn Cottage C16.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is absolutely ideal for them with very few stiles, busy roads and fields with livestock. The pub is good with dogs too. Any dog off the lead must be under control.\nThe\nroute\n(click the link to see it):\nWe'll follow Rake Lane to the A283 then go north along it, turning west at Milford Heath Road. We'll then turn south and use a bit of Haslemere Road before entering the heathland at Sandy Lane and using a bridleway to go to under the A3 at Mousehill and all the way to Ockley Common and Pudmore Pond. At Moat Pond we'll cross Thursley Road and use a bridleway to go along Woolfords Lane north. A boardwalk across the heath and footpaths will then take us south to Thursley for lunch.

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nDo I need a guided session?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched').

We will weave our way between Essex and Hertfordshire as we cross a number of locks across the river. On the outskirts of Roydon we will turn northwards and head uphill for a couple of miles across open farmland towards the pretty village of Hunsdon. Here we will stop for lunch.\nUpon leaving the village we will turn east across an old Second World War air force base, RAF Hunsdon, still in use for small aircraft. Our route then leads us towards the noticeable spire of St Mary's church in the small settlement of Gilston, a Grade-I listed building dating from the 13th century.

    "Summary": "Our monthly London pub socials are the perfect gateway to Outdoor Lads and our busy diary of brilliant events, and for December we're trying a new queer venue at Elephant & Castle!\nIf you’re feeling hungry and fancy a bite, The Rising partners with Yard Sale Pizza, so you can order delicious pizzas to enjoy on the premises. They’ll even provide plates and cutlery.\nTypically our socials have a rich mix of regulars, occasionals, and newbies, not only from London and the South East, but dropping in from across the country.\nWhether it's hiking, camping, cycling, climbing, or a range of other activities - we do it!  Outdoors is our focus, but our socials are the chance to catch up with lads you've already met, find out about the group, and meet new members and event leaders.\nLook forward to seeing you!\nIs this your first ODL event?\nIf you have never been to one of our events before, attending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like. Check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.\n---\nFeedback from our London Social:\n\"it was my first ever event and I was super nervous walking in, but I was really welcomed, and ended up having a good evening, the guys were great. I heard about the ODL activities, I'm in!\"\n\"I don't live in London, but was down for work that day, so I came along. Brilliant to catch up with some of the lads I haven't seen in a long while\"\nPhotos:\nProvided by the leader and used with permission.",

    "Summary": "Please note that this walk takes place on a Monday.\nYou came, and looked and loved the view, Long-known and loved by me, Green Sussex fading into blue, With one gray glimpse of sea.\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson: 'Green Sussex'\nLooking slightly more grey and muted than green, you'll nevertheless share Tennyson's sentiments about the view from his handsome hillside home on this strenuous but satisfying stride. Starting from Haslemere yet again, we'll soon leave Surrey, enter West Sussex and ascend its highest hill: the great whale-backed bluff of Blackdown. There, from the Temple of the Winds viewpoint, we'll survey the landscape that we'll explore: the low-lying but pretty patchwork of meadows, ponds, copses and villages of the western Low Weald. Probably prettiest of the villages is Lurgashall, where we'll have lunch in the Noah's Ark pub which dates back to the sixteenth century.\nThe sights:\nBlackdown:\nA rugged greensand plateau, 280m high, cared for by the National Trust. It is named after the dark pine trees that cap its summit. Its human history is interesting: Middle-Stone Age (6000BC) people dwelt there; smugglers hid their contraband in caves there; London was alerted to the coming of the Spanish Armada by a beacon there; and in 1967, Iberian Airlines Flight 062 crashed there due to a faulty altimeter reading; Alfred, Lord Tennyson, lived there at Aldworth House; and from 1796 to 1816 the navy had a shutter telegraph station there.\nLow Weald:\n\"The wooded and watery Low Weald...is a low-lying gently undulating landscape of clay vales and gentle ridges of limestone and sandstone. The landscape is small-scale, intimate and tranquil with a medieval pattern of small irregular pasture fields enclosed by a strong network of shaws [thickets] and tall, thick, species-rich hedgerows.\" (West Sussex Landscape: The Low Weald Character Area)\nLurgashall:\nA beautiful village around a triangular green. The houses are mostly stone, but with some tile-hanging to indicate the closeness of Surrey. St Laurence's Church is attractive, C11, with a C13 chancel, and C16 aisle. The Noah's Ark Inn (named thus because drinkers had to cross the village pond on a gangplank to reach it) is C16. It also has a village shop.\nThe\nroute\n(please check this at the OS website to see the elevations)\n:\nWe'll head southeast through Haslemere through Shepherd's Hill and Haste Hill to pick up Chase Lane which will take us up, along with the Sussex Border Path and Serpent's Trail, Blackdown's plateau. After breaking at The Temple of the Winds, we'll go on a zigzag descent to Quellwood Common and Windfall Wood Common. Here, High Lane and Dial Green Lane will take us to Lurgashall for lunch. Blind Lane will take us to Crossways, and then Hillgrove Lane to Hillgrove. Bullock Lane track will take us to Jobson's Lane and a footpath to Roundhurst Common. Arriving at Aldworth, we'll walk beside the B2131 (there's a pavement) back to Haslemere.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them although there will be considerable lane walking and fields with livestock. A dog off the lead must be obedient. Dogs are welcome in the pub at lunchtime.\n(All pictures taken by the leader in November 2021 and December 2024. OutdoorLads is welcome to reuse them.)",

Flint tools and arrowheads have been found at the summit, dating from Mesolithic (15000 – 5000 BCE) to Bronze Age (1200 BCE) times.\nWalking around the reservoirs in the Naden Valley. The Naden reservoirs were built in the 1840’s above Green Booth village. Greenbooth reservoir was built in the 1950s to meet the further demands of water for Rochdale and opened in 1965, submerging the village.\nView across Ashworth Moor Reservoir. Completed in 1905, during the digging, a palstave, a Bronze Age axe-like implement, cast from bronze was discovered. It remains a relatively rare find in the county, with only six others of this type being discovered. The palstave dates from around 1400-1200BC and is housed in Manchester Museum.\nOur walk will finish  at Owd Betts pub.\nImage / photo credits:  All leaders own images - with permission for OutdoorLads to use and reuse.\nAre you new to Outdoorlads and considering your first event?\nHave a look at this link, hopefully it will help.\nhttps://www.outdoorlads.com/my-first-event\nDon’t worry if the event is full.\nDo sign up\nand join the waiting list.\nOften those on the main list cancel nearer the time.\nThere is a very high chance you will still get a place",

The focus for the session will be on climbing rather than bouldering, experienced boulderers are welcome,\nhowever there will be no bouldering leaders available to teach bouldering\n(only climbing with ropes).\nThose familiar to climbing will already know that climbing is a full-body workout that engages muscles you never knew you had, helping to improve your strength whilst improving your balance and coordination. However climbing is more than just a physical activity - it’s a great opportunity to socialise with other members making long lasting friendships with like minded people.\nNew to climbing?\nNo problem! Whether you're a seasoned climber or completely new to the sport, we offer climbing sessions cater which to all levels of experience. This particular event however is intended for more experienced climbers. If you are new to the sport, we suggest you join Outdoor Lads at one our regular climbing events on Monday evenings in Manchester, where we offer supervised sessions to introduce you to the sport.\nExperienced climbers\nTo climb unsupervised, you'll need to demonstrate basic climbing skills, including:\nFitting a harness correctly\nTying in with the correct knots\nBelaying and lowering another climber\nAnswering safety questions\nIf you're unsure about any of these then we recommend you join us at one of our Manchester sessions which are geared up to teach climbing.\nReady to climb?\nSign up! Please register via the event page so the event leader can look out for you.\nIf you are new to the climbing centre, complete their waiver in advance to save time on the day. You can find the waiver\nhere\n.\nYou’ll need to pay the centre’s entry fee directly on arrival directly to the centre.\nWe’ll be waiting in the reception area so come join us. If you are running late, don’t worry, we’ll be in the climbing area so let us know when you arrive and we’ll get you set up.\nAny questions?\nPlease feel free to contact the leader directly if you have any questions. The best way to do this is to message the leader directly rather than leaving a message on the event.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by\nSieh\nand\nj-austin\n.",

It will also improve your belaying techniques, including a chance to try different belay devices and give you the skills for catching a fall on a lead route. The session will be tailored to the experience of the group - but you should be at least climbing Grade 6a on lead and be a confident belayer.\nWhat will it cost?\nThe cost of this event covers the professional coaching session, including the cost of entry to the climbing centre, so you're welcome to warm-up before hand as part of our usual Monday night climbing which is taking place alongside this event. Feel free to sign up to both.\nPhotos : Copyright granted to OutdoorLads by\nSieh\n.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nYou will need to make sure you have completed the centres\nRegistration and Disclaimer\n- this also counts for climbers who have already been to other DEPOT centres - you need to complete a new registration for BIG Depot Manchester if you've not been to this centre before, as it has different restrictions.",

    "Summary": "Join OutdoorLads for an evening of indoor climbing & bouldering at Redpoint Climbing Centre in Birmingham.\n\"EXPERIENCED\" in this instance is those that have previously climbed & can answer YES to all three of these questions:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie in to a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly & confidently?\nPlease ensure you only sign up for this event if you\nsatisfy all three of the prerequisites as an experienced climber!\nNever climbed before? Need a refresher on the basics? Answered NO to any of the three questions above? You will need to\nattend a beginners event\ninstead, where we will happily sign you in to be supervised (two people per leader maximum), show you the ropes & teach you everything you need to know to climb safely!\nBouldering\n- Whilst most of us do roped climbing, if you prefer to do bouldering, you can sign yourself in & go bouldering (unsupervised) instead of, or as well as, roped climbing. Please meet the leader & the group at the start though; some others might wish to do bouldering too!\nPlease note that we will not teach lead climbing or lead belaying on this event -\nwe would suggest having some\nlessons in Lead Climbing\nby a qualified member of staff if this is something you're interested in pursuing!\nWhilst this event finishes at 8pm, the centre is open until 10pm if you wish to continue climbing for longer!\nIf you are subsequently unable to attend, please cancel off the event as 'no-shows' are frustrating for the leader & other attendees.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nIndoor climbing centres offer the challenges of climbing that you'll find on natural rock crags - simply indoors! It's a fun way to stay fit, make new friends & develop your climbing skills.\nClimbing\n- Unlike Indoor Bouldering there is a certain amount of skill to be mastered, such as tying in knots & belaying a partner, as well as the climbs being higher than in bouldering. If you are new to climbing or would like a refresher, then this is just for you!! If you’ve climbed before, can safely tie into a harness & can competently belay, then there’s plenty of choices of top-rope & lead climbing on offer here.\nBouldering\n- Instead of tackling long high routes, the 'problems' (as they are referred to) are shorter & focus on technique, balance, body positioning & sometimes power. With the different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, so it’s excellent (but not necessarily easier) for newcomers.\nRedpoint Climbing Centre\nhas more than 75 lines with over 300 routes, set through some spectacular ground including its notorious 'stalactite'. It even features one of the few indoor 'Yorkshire VS cracks' in the country, to test your jamming skills. The bouldering rooms are just as interesting as its climbing routes, over 200 bouldering problems have been organised into graded circuits to provide something for everyone.\nYou MUST register via this event page before coming to the centre!\nTo climb at Redpoint you will need to:\nComplete a\nRegistration Form\n(please arrive early to do this in-person the first time) & pay a Registration Fee:\nAnnual Registration\nis\n£5\nor\nDay Registration\nis\n£3\nPay an\nEntry Fee\ndirectly to the climbing centre:\nStandard Entry\nis\n£12.50\n&\nBouldering Only\nis\n£8.50.\nHire\nclimbing shoes (\n£3.50\n) & a climbing harness (\n£3.50\n) if you don't own your own.\nPlease see Redpoint's\nwebsite\nfor current prices & note that prices are subject to change.\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the climbing centre's own terms & conditions of participation & abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre's staff.\nPhotos:\ntaken & used with permission of\nW.

    "Summary": "Swap trainers for climbing shoes and join OutdoorLads for an evening of INDOOR BOULDERING at Nottingham’s newest bouldering venue\nNOTE: If you are climbing with us for the first time\n, either as an experienced climber or beginner, please send a note to the\nEvent Leader\ntelling them about your experience and goals. There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nWhat is Bouldering?\nIt's a form of climbing where instead of long high routes, the 'problems' tend to be shorter and focus on technique, balance, body positioning and sometimes power. Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes it an excellent activity for newcomers to the sport. No wonder it's often regarded as the 'purest' form of climbing.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nI've been Bouldering before?\nAs above, everyone attending the event  must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement at all times. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nTo climb at Nottingham Climbing Centre you will need to:\n-     Complete a climbing waiver for the centre (please arrive early to do this the first time, or better still complete it online before you arrive.) You can find the\nlink\nto the waiver and bouldering safety video\nhere\non Nottingham Climbing Centre's website.\n-     Pay the Lifetime Registration Fee - £6.00\n-     Pay an Entry Fee directly to the climbing centre - £9.50 (ensure you mention ODL)\n-     Hire shoes (if you don’t have your own) - £3.50*\n*Equipment hire charges will be waived for your first visit to the centre!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event. You only need to complete this Participation Statement once, not for each event you attend.\nPlease note that every person participating should be aware of (and accept) that those members perceived as ‘in charge’ or leading the event are not necessarily qualified, do not need to be qualified, and are not regarded by OutdoorLads, or themselves as ‘technical experts’ but are amateur climbers with some experience and who are happy to impart their knowledge. Any advice given should be considered with this in mind by the recipient.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff.

We'll take in a variety of sights and enjoy varied terrain. Given the time of year there is a good balance between woodland paths and very quiet tarmac roads. The highlight will be visiting the ruins of a church in Bedham. Much of the building still exists and it is a real joy to see.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nStopham Bridge\nThis bridge crosses the River Arun and is one of two we cross during our hike. The Stopham Bridge dates back to about 1423 and is a Grade I scheduled monument. One arch was destroyed during the English Civil War, which resulted in a drawbridge being added. This in turn was later replaced and in 1822 the centre was raised to allow larger boats to pass under.\nStopham Church\nMuch of this church dates back to the 11th century and inside it is a real treasure trove.  There are various plaques, stained glass windows and artefacts all depicting various events that have taken place.\nBedham Church\nBuilt in 1880 and also known as St Michael and All Angels Church. This delightful ruin was once home to a school and a church. The main single room was simply divided in two by a curtain so lessons and prayer could take place together. Sadly, due to Bedham being a hamlet and a declining population lessons stopped in 1925. The church itself continued until 1959 when services then stopped. A lovely structure, although now without a roof, it is a joy to visit. Given its location partly hidden in woodland it also feels like it has so many stories to tell.\nCoombelands\nYou'd think this massive site would have been here generations. Yet it was only in 1996 that things got serious.  The site is vast and and as well as training race horses; they host events and have a farm to boot.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend.

I am happy to consider opening more slots if there is enough interest.\nEscape the Christmas madness for a few hours — ditch the turkey, sprouts, and endless small talk with relatives who\nstill\ndon’t get it. Instead, grab some fresh air, take in the views, burn off those extra Xmas calories, and sample the delights of a cosy country pub.\nThis walk explores one of the most scenic areas of the Chilterns, the Hamble Valley, including extensive wooded hills and valley floor. The Hamble Valley was one of the first places in the Chilterns to be occupied by man due to it's lush valley and flowing brooks, making it ideal for early settlements. It is also close to the Thames which was a major highway before roads became a viable option.\nWe will start in the scenic village of Hambleden, known for its timeless charm and has attracted the attention of filmmakers and TV producers over the years, including the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice and the area in general is synonymous with \"The Vicar of Dibley\" and \"Midsomer Murders\", but with the latter don't be put off as it's not the murder capital of the UK!\nFrom Hambleden we will initially venture west including a climb up the valley through the extensive Great Wood with it's beech woodland. Taking a series of paths and quiet lanes, at the half way point we reach the quiet hamlet of Southend. From Southend we take the Chilterns Way for a while, going downhill with views over to Turville and it's distinctive windmill. We then wind back up and then downhill through more woodland to eventually arrive at the village of Skirmett, with it's jumble of flint and brick houses. After Skirmett we will take a flat route along the bottom of the valley back to Hambleden, with the option to visit the pub for a festive drink.\nThe route - click this link in\nred\nto see it.\nDogs:\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome, there are a few stiles on route and quiet lane sections and crossings but generally the going is suitable for dogs to be off the lead for much of the time. Please abide by the Countryside Code (\nhttps://tinyurl.com/rlqvp3h\n) and remember not everyone loves dogs as much as you do so be mindful of other members.\nIs this your first ODL event?\nAttending your first event with OutdoorLads might feel daunting. What will happen, who will be there, and what can you expect? We know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first ODL event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the ODL website\n.\nIf you have any other questions you can send a message to the leader.",

You will need a relatively good level of fitness for the walk.\nPlease bring a packed lunch\nand maybe a flask of hot drink if it's cold.\nIf you don't fancy coming on the walk, you can choose to stay in the hostel or explore nearby Lynton and Porlock Weir.\nSaturday evening:\nRelax and socialise or help out preparing the 2 course evening meal (included in the event cost) which we'll all enjoy.\nSunday\nAfter breakfast we'll help clean and tidy away leaving the hostel as we found it.  After that you can explore the North Devon Coast.\nACCESIBILITY:\nAs mentioned this hostel is accessible to wheelchair users, with a hoist system available in some rooms and we have the ability to make additional arrangements to support a carer attending if needed.  This means that whilst our walk along the coastal path might not be suitable, we would love to offer the opportunity to attend to someone that might not normally be able to join Outdoorlads events.  If this is you please reach out to\nsupport@outdoorlads.com\nso we can ensure we can cater to all of your needs.\nPLEASE NOTE:\nOur location provider has asked that no nuts are to be brought onto the site.\nPhoto Credits:\nAll photos taken by OutdoorLads Members and permission is granted to OutdoorLads for further use.",

    "Summary": "Energize the New Year.\nPut a spring in your step with a walk up the Titterstone Clee Hill. Join me for a fresh 8 mile circuit of the Clee, with a little over 400 metres of ascent, and work off around 1700 calories!\nSee from Snowdonia to the Cotswolds.\nThe Titterstone Clee Hill has tremendous views. It is the most southerly of Shropshire's highest peaks, rising to 533 metres above sea level. The vistas are glorious in clear weather: all the way from Hay Bluff in the Brecon Beacons to Cadair Idris in Snowdonia, Wales; from the Cotswolds to the Peak District in England as well as the other Shropshire Hills and Malverns.\nExplore boulder field and quarry.\nLayer after layer of different forms of rock created a rich mixture of geology on the Clee, which was glaciated 10 000 and more years ago. This left a huge boulder field to the west and a pile of periglacial boulders near the summit, known as the Giant's Chair, which we shall see on our walk. Several quarries over the centuries exploited the rock, and there are remains of older tramways and cut rock seams. The lower quarry is still in use for roadstone. The quarry near the summit is in process of being opened for rock climbing by negotiation between the BMC and site owners. We will explore the summit quarry on our way to the top.\nThousands of years of history.\nNear the summit are remains of a Bronze Age cairn, from around 4000 years ago. 2500 years back, the hill became an Iron Age hill fort with stone banks, instead of more common earthly ones. In medieval times the hill was recorded in Hereford Cathedral's Mappa Mundi. The Titterstone Clee was the setting for one of the Cadfael series of historical novels:\n'The Virgin in the Ice'\nby Ellis Peters.\nScientific fact and fiction.\nYou will recognise the Clee from a more modern feature: a gold ball like antenna on the top. Originally a secret monitoring station in World War Two, this is now an important radar for air traffic control. If you've played video games you may recognise the hill from Assassin's Creed Valhalla. The Clee is Scriopescire, a whole region to explore in the game.\nI walked this circuit last winter and really enjoyed bounding over the boulders and taking in the fresh air. I recognised the furthest hills in the distance, so I can confirm you really can see that far! So, what better than to share this with you for the New Year.\nWell behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you really want to attend, add yourself to the waitlist, because places often become available closer to the date.\nIf you want to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?   Sign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nAll images are taken by FrankieB and may be used by Outdoorlads.",

Restoration efforts are now focusing on reshaping and lining the canal bed at the south of the Shropshire part of the canal. Activities typically include scrub clearing, liner laying, block laying etc. More details of restoration activities can be found here, including reports from previous work parties which give a sense of what we will be doing across the weekend:\nhttps://shropshireunion.org.uk/restoration/\nPractically, this event will require some physical work but will be based on what you feel able to do and will be under the supervision of experienced volunteers. There will be a health and safety briefing on the morning you join the event.\nThe volunteering will start between 8am and 9am on Friday 10th April 2026, but you have the option to join 8am to 9am on Saturday 11th April 2026 if you can't make the Friday.\nPlease message me when you sign up to indicate whether you will start on Friday or Saturday. If starting Saturday, please let me know if you will arrive Friday night or Saturday morning.\nThere are local options for B&B and campsites. For those who want to camp, subject to having enough numbers,\nhttps://www.wildcontentment.com/\nhave agreed to open a weekend early for us and accommodate us! They have some amazing bathrooms as part of their campsite - please take a look.\nPlease let me know if you would like to camp as part of a group when you sign up (which will be subject to direct payment to the campsite).\nI will look to co-ordinate a\ndinner on the Saturday\nevening once we have more clarity on numbers.\nPlease let me know if you would like to be included in a Saturday evening pub dinner when you sign up.\nThe Monty has been part of my life for about 20 years now and it truly is a beautiful part of the borderlands.

    "Summary": "Come and walk the old railways of Granton, Newhaven & Leith and burn off those Christmas excesses!\nLong before the phrase Active Travel entered government lexicon Lothian Regional Council started buying old railway trackbeds from British Rail, as BR went about removing the railway network in the 70s and 80s that had existed across the north of Edinburgh. This foresightedness has left a legacy of a network of popular paths crossing the city.\nThis figure of eight walk covers a large proportion of these lines, starting from Scotland Street station which was the original terminus of the Edinburgh, Leith & Newhaven railway when it opened in August 1842. From here we head north to Trinity and west to Granton. Here the EL&G (having decided that it wanted to go to Granton, not just Newhaven) met the Caledonian and we take up the Caleys route south to Crew junction before heading east to Leith. From Leith we pick up the EL&G again which takes us back to Scotland Street.\nApart from one detour near Chancelot, the route is entirely on tarmac paths as the council have improved these railway paths for cyclists. Whilst most of the routes are as they were when rails ran along them much has changed around them, so is an interesting perspective on the changing face of Edinburgh and Leith.\nPhotos :\nTaken by AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups and bookmark our upcoming events list with\nthis link\n.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

There is a limit to the number of beginners that we can accommodate at each session. Each beginner needs to be supervised so we need to ensure there are enough experienced climbers to help you out. Climbing is great fun! It's a fab workout, in a social environment, and anyone can do it! Give it a go!\nNottingham Climbing Centre\nNottingham Climbing Centre is equipped with walls and routes to suit all skill levels and groups of climbers, whether you are a novice looking to try climbing for the first time, or an experienced lead climber, you’ll find an area to challenge you. With 28 Top Ropes routes available as well as 24 Lines of Lead climbing for the more advanced individuals. In addition, 6 auto-belays are available, so there is always the opportunity to climb, even if the numbers don’t match up. The available bouldering walls also provide that extra physical and mental challenge for those looking for something slightly different from rope work. Both Bouldering and Rope Climbing routes range from 4a – 8a.\nI'm new to Climbing - can I come along?\nIf you've never climbed before or need a refresher, the leader will sign you into the climbing centre as a\nsupervised climber\nso that you can come and give it a try (it can be helpful to message the leader to let them know). If you enjoy your climbing experience, and would like to come climbing more regularly, we will also happily show you the ropes and teach you everything you need to know to climb safely.\nDo I need to be Supervised as a Climber?\nIf you answer\nNO\nto any of the following three questions, then you will need to arrange to be supervised. If you can answer YES to all these questions, you can sign up to this event as normal:\nCan you fit a climbing harness correctly?\nCan you tie yourself to the end of a rope using the correct knots?\nCan you belay another climber correctly and confidently?\nTo come along, you will need to register via this event page and to climb you will need to pay an entry fee directly to the climbing centre when you arrive, please see their\nwebsite\nfor up-to-date prices.

Most of us do roped climbing, but if you prefer bouldering, you can sign yourself in and do it, as long as you can fill in the climbing centre's form correctly, watch their\nsafety video\nand can answer the simple safety questions at reception on your first visit. Meet the group at the start; some others might be bouldering. We will make sure we come and find you when we have our tea break!\nIf you have any questions or need any more information just get in touch with the event leader by clicking on their profile below, or take a look at the\nMy first climbing event page\nfor more information.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n, in addition to booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "Work off the turkey with a Boxing Day walk around Totnes and the River Dart\nThe route is as follows:\n1. **Totnes Town Centre to the River Dart**\nBegin your walk in Totnes town centre. Head north out of town, crossing the River Dart. Take a moment to enjoy the view of the river, which has long been central to Totnes’s history and trade.\n2. **Riverside Path towards Dartington**\nFollow the path north-west, keeping the river close on your right. The route soon opens into fields and gentle countryside. Look out for wildlife along the riverbanks.\n3. **Into Dartington Estate**\nContinue towards Dartington. The estate is known for its historic hall, gardens, and ancient woodlands. You’ll pass through lanes and farmland here, with views across the valley.\n4. **Northern Loop by Staverton**\nSkirt towards the small village of Staverton. You won’t enter the village centre on this route, but you’ll be close to its edge. Here the walk loops eastwards, climbing gently before turning south. This section gives wide views across the South Hams countryside.\n5. **Heading South back to Totnes**\nThe return route follows quiet tracks and lanes back towards Totnes. You’ll cross the River Dart again near the railway, not far from the South Devon Railway line, where steam trains often run – a real treat if you spot one!\n6. **Final Stretch into Town**\nFrom the riverside, head back through Totnes’s historic streets to your starting point. There are plenty of cafés, pubs, and shops to enjoy at the end of your walk.\nAll photos taken by Outdoorlads members.

As The Chase is home to a herd of around 800 fallow deer, wildlife sightings are also possible.\nAs well as Cannock Chase, we'll also be exploring sections of the Trent & Mersey and Staffs and Worcester canals.\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.

    "Summary": "Join Outdoor Lads for a winter ramble through the central Peak District; taking in beautiful panoramas, atmospheric forests and old remote churches, followed by a trip to the local country pub.\nPoints of interest on the route:\nTegg's Nose Country Park:\nFormerly a sandstone quarry, the park now offers a large network of trails on the border of the Peak District.  We'll hike up to the parks highest point, giving us great views over Cheshire & Greater Manchester.\nMacclesfield Forest:\nA historic royal hunting forest that was owned by the Earl of Chester; Macclesfield Forest is now a mix of planted coniferous and native deciduous woodlands, and home to many bird and animal species. We'll pass through different parts of the forest, including a visit to St Stephen's Church , the \"Forest Chapel\", which has been on the edge of the forest since 1673.\nShutlingsloe:\nAt 506m, the perhaps hyperbolically nicknamed '\"Cheshire Matterhorn\", is a distinctively shaped hill south east of Macclesfield Forest and the highest point of our walk. The ascent isn't too long but is very steep, so we'll take our time with this section. Once on top, we'll be greeted with spectacular views of the rest of the Peak District National Park, much of Cheshireand Greater Manchester, and even as far as The Clwydian Range in North Wales.\nOther Infomation:\nDog Suitability:\nDogs are always welcome on my walks, though their behaviour and safety is their owner's responsibility. This includes cleaning up after them, controlling their behaviour around other animals or people, and assisting them over any stiles or streams we may cross.\nNew Members\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.",

    "Summary": "'A Yuletide Tudor Trail' was a possible title for this walk, because the shadow of the second Tudor monarch, his second wife and his second daughter will loom large over this festive foray around quiet lanes, along the valley of the River Eden and into the High Weald of Kent. We'll even finish at a pub named after him. As we proceed to Markbeech and then to Chiddingstone and back to Hever (alas, not seeing the latter's castle) we'll encounter cosy cottages, charming churches, tranquil tracks, whispering woodlands and pleasant pastures. The Christmassyness will climax at lunchtime at The Castle Inn at Chiddingstone when we'll banquet beneath the fifteenth-century beams.\nThe sights:\nMarkbeech:\nA small hamlet with a Victorian church perched high up on the northernmost sandstone ridge of the High Weald.\nChiddingstone:\nA unique and perfect example of a Tudor one-street village, so perfect, that the whole place is in the care of the National Trust. It's quite a film star too, as it featured in the 1985 Merchant Ivory film\nA Room With a View,\nMichael Winner's 1983\nThe Wicked Lady\nand the outdoor scenes of the BBC's 1971\nElizabeth R\n, starring Glenda Jackson. St Mary's Church is opulent, C14 and C15, and has the tombs to the Streatfeild family (you may have heard of Noel, the author) who lived at early C19 Chiddingstone Castle. The village takes its name from the Chiding Stone, a Saxon judicial place or boundary marker and place of public correction or 'chiding'. Plus, we're having lunch at the C15 Castle Inn - how cool is that?\nHever:\nMore pleasant timber-framed original and mock-Tudor cottages, including our last pub stop, the Henry VIII. St Peter's Church contains the tomb of Thomas Boleyn of Hever Castle, father of Anne Boleyn and grandfather of Elizabeth I. Unfortunately, we won't see Hever Castle, childhood home of Anne.\nThe\nroute\n:\nWe'll follow a lane to Uckfield Lane which we'll soon leave to follow a footpath south through Oak Wood. Upon reaching Cowden Pound Road we'll turn east into Markbeech, before following a footpath round to Horseshoe Green where we'll pick up a footpath to Buckhurst farm. We'll then follow Truggers Lane east then Rywell Road and Wellers Town Road north. We'll then be on Chiddingstone Road which will take us west to the pub. A permissive path through the grounds of Chiddingstone Castle will allow us to get to Hill Hoath Road which we'll follow south before picking up the Eden Valley Walk through Hever back to the station.\nDogs:\nDogs are very welcome on this walk. There will be lots of fields and woods for them to run free, but there will also be some roads and stiles. A dog off the lead must be obedient.\n(All images were taken by the leader in November 2025.)",

We will cross the river on the swing bridge and go to a viewpoint over the town, where the mountains of Eryri form an impressive backdrop. We'll then take the Wales coast path (a minor road at this point) which has lovely views of the Menai Straits for a couple of miles. After that we will head inland crossing a small hill with further views, and through some farms to pick up the course of the Welsh Highland steam railway where the trains which are pulled by very unique locomotives which articulate in the middle and have two sets of driving wheels to cope with the bends and gradients through the Snowdon Mountain Range. A footpath follows this back into the town. Caernarfon is a walled  town with nearby Roman origins, however the castle and walls were built in the 13C by the English King Edward 1st, after the ruler of Gwynedd refused to pay homage to the English. It is now a designated World Heritage Site and the imposing castle is one of the largest in Wales. Dolphins are often seen just offshore. The little streets within the town walls are picturesque and fascinating to explore. A short tour around town will round of the event and here we can also share a meal together. The meal is optional and a booking will be set up a few days before the event for those who wish to partake. It will probably be in an old pub, subject to availability and numbers; you will be messaged through the Outdoorlads message system to reserve your place for food.\nBad Weather\nThis event may be altered or cancelled if persistent heavy rain is forecast - you will be notified at least 24 hours beforehand in this case\nDogs\nare welcome to join us on this event but your dog needs to be well behaved and it must not affect other member's enjoyment of the event.

    "Summary": "This walk is a more challenging route, not for the fainthearted or those with less walking experience. A lot of the sections make use of unfrequented paths and there are several climbs (some that are fairly steep) spread throughout the walk.  If you are feeling fighting fit and want to test those legs, join Steven for this near thirteen mile rewarding round in the remote Yorkshire Dales.\nWaterfalls are a big feature of this walk and several are seen at close quarters, others glimpsed from afar. The deep valley of Upper Swaledale cuts into the Pennines and was justifiably chosen by Alfred Wainwright for his Coast to Coast route.  Mother nature has truly excelled here and the abandoned farmsteads just add to the feeling of isolation.\nWe follow part of Alfred Wainwright's route for almost a quarter of the walk , The leader walked this path on his first expedition twenty years ago, so expect many tales about this on the way downhill.\nThe walk starts with a climb up above the four hundred metre contour. There will be plenty of pauses for a breather/drink or photograph, Then, as the contours become kinder, extensive views are revealed on the watershed.  A lot of the nearby high Pennines are in view. Great Shunner Fell looks lofty from here and the limestone scars are seen at close quarters on the following descent.\nThe path down in the dale wanders through the maze of dry stone walls to the other side of the valley and, after a short break, another climb on an indistinct trail rises before a very gradual descent over grouse moor leads back to the River Swale and a small waterfall by a bridge.\nSeveral stone barns are passed as the route weaves up to the remote spot of Ravenseat. The farm has featured in a television series and the Yorkshire Shepherdess might greet us here.\nAnother slower ascent follows skirting a ravine before reaching a broader moor, passing another ruin and then above a tree-covered limestone scar descends to the opposite side of the Swale to Keld and a visit to a series of beautiful waterfalls.\nIf time allows, we will walk over to the inn on the other side of the village before doing the easy gradual descent of the walk.\nIf you would like a full day out and need a good bit of exercise please come along and see a remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales , You might be inspired to walk the 192 miles of the Coast to Coast yourself some time soon.\nThis route is suitable for well behaved dogs. There is livestock in many fields and there are some sections where your pet might need to be assisted over dry stone wall crossings.\nPhoto Credits - All photographs were taken by the walk leader.

We start on a lower path before climbing towards Normanby le Wold, where the higher ground gives clear views across much of Lincolnshire.\nOur lunch stop is All Saints Church, often called the Ramblers’ Church. It is known for its distinctive stained-glass window showing walkers and cyclists, added in the 1950s, and for its long association with people exploring the Wolds.\nAfter lunch, we continue on towards Tealby and stop at the King’s Head, one of the oldest thatched pubs in Lincolnshire, with parts of the building dating back to the 14th century.\nWe finish the walk with a relaxed return to Walesby along a lower, quieter route, bringing the day to a close.\nFor those interested in a Parkrun before the event, the nearest one is in\nMarket Rasen\n, just 5.5 miles (11 minutes) away.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nWhat if there is a Waiting List?\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage Credits:\nAll images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.",

    "Summary": "Much of the interest on this walk centres on the Battle of Bosworth, which was fought on the slopes of Ambion Hill and in the adjoining fields to the west of Market Bosworth.  The route passes across part of the battlefield, now a country park and well worth a lengthy exploration, I hope to find the visitor centre by lunch time so we can have good look round.\nAfter lunch we'll take the Battlefield Trail across Ambion Hill to Shenton Station.  Along the way illustrated panels show the positions of the armies and how the day unfurled.  The Battle of Bosworth, fought between the armies of Richard III and Henry Tudor on 22nd August 1485, is regarded as one of the most critical and significant battles in English history.  It bought to an end the 30 year long War of the Roses and is regarded by historians as marking the effective end of the Middle Ages, and was the last battle during which an English King died.  The victor ascended the throne as Henry VII, the start of the Tudor dynasty (and end of the House of Plantagenet).\nThe afternoon walk includes a tranquil stretch along the Ashby Canal as well as offering some fine views over the surrounding gentle countryside.\nFor over 300 years the Dixies were lords of the Manor, owning a large estate around the pleasant town of Market Bosworth.  This is still very evident today, with signs of Dixies here, there and everywhere.  This also has an interesting tale of what happens to some hereditary titles, the Dixie Baronetcy went extinct in 1975 when the 13th Baronet died with no male heir.\nGay History and Legend\nBy the time of Shakespeare, a century has past since the defeat of Richard III.  In the Renaissance period Richard is now firmly portrayed as the villain, fairly or unfairly we'll perhaps never know.  In the first episode of Black Adder, \"The Foretelling\", it explains that King Richard III was actually a kind, benevolent ruler who doted on his nephews and that his popular image as a murderous usurper is based on lies spread by his rival, Henry Tudor.\nShakespeare portrays Richard, in his wordplay as \"unfinished,\" ultimately Shakespeare enticing the audience of the time to conclude that Richard represents a figure that transgresses the margins of sexual polarities, making him a threat to the very essence of Renaissance gender identity.\nIn 1995, Ian McKellen, an openly gay actor who has fought Britain’s homophobic Clause 28, played Richard set in a fictional fascist England, in Richard Loncraine’s film of\nRichard III\n.\nWaitlist:\nIf this event is fully booked and you want to attend, just add yourself to the waitlist, because places inevitably become available closer to the date.\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in the Midlands / ODL Central Region?\nSign up for\nCentral Region Events Notifications (Telegram Channel)\nand the\nCentral Region Telegram Chat Group\n, and bookmark our upcoming events list via the short link:\nhttps://outdoorlads.events/central\n.\nImage Credits: All images taken by the event leader with permission for ODL use.",

As such you should have a good level of fitness and be comfortable hiking in challenging terrain, using ice axes and crampons, as it is intended that we will be doing mountaineering in snow. If in doubt please message the event leader for guidance. The exact nature of activities on offer will be dictated by the weather conditions on the day - in the advent of adverse weather we will be doing low level walks in the local area as being on the mountain tops is not a place to be in wild weather!\nWe are staying in a bunkhouse at the head of Loch Torridon in among a collection of mountains that are highly regarded for their location and view, the big three being Liathach, Beinn Eighe and Beinn Alligin; but be warned even some of the smaller hills such as Beinn Damh to the south of the bunkhouse are also fantastic days out - what we do will be very much driven by the weather forecast. The hope is that there will be some snow about, and for that you will need to bring crampons and an ice axe - plus be proficient in their use.\nFor this bunkhouse you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.\nPhotos :\nby AMD\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWant to keep in touch with what's going on in Scotland?\nJoin our Telegram\nchat\nand\nnotification\ngroups, and bookmark our upcoming events list via our\nScottish Calendar\n.",

Both those towns are within easy reach for simple day walks and their respective tourist attractions. Alternatively, some more dramatic mountain walking can be found within a short drive.\nThe activities:\nas we'll have two full days at our disposal, there will be an opportunity to take maximum advantage of this varied, beautiful region. Exact walks on offer will depend upon leaders attending, but will likely include at least one easier and one tougher walk each day. Wales' highest waterfall (Pistyll Rhaeadr) isn't far, with the adjacent Berwyn Mountains. Llangollen is always popular, as is the fascinating Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.\nNew Year's Eve:\nwhile this event is not intended to be a \"party event\", we will, of course, mark the arrival of the new year. Think dinner with friends, silly games, and general merriment :)\nThe accommodation\n: Our accommodation is well-equipped and comfortable, across a bunkhouse and cottages, with shared rooms of varying sizes (max. 8). Bedding is provided, but you'll need your own towel.\nDogs:\nThis venue is not suitable for dogs.\nOUTDOORLADS FOUNDATION\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Summary": "The Derby '\nNomad Way\n' is an 80 km (50 mile) recreational route circumnavigating the City of Derby. The route celebrates the Derby Nomad Ramblers, formed in 1935, many of whom took part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932, which resulted in the opening of access to the moors and freedom to roam the countryside that we enjoy today. The walk is broken into a series day walks between 8.8 km (5.5 miles) and 20 km (12.5 miles) long.\nPlease note\n: we will be using public transport for these walks. Each leg begins and ends in the centre of Derby via a bus ride to the start point and back from the end point to the City centre.\nThe route traverses the rolling countryside within the districts of Amber Valley, Erewash Valley and\nSouth Derbyshire\n, and it passes through 22 Civil Parishes surrounding the Derby City boundary with numerous places of interest along the way. Overall, the walk terrain is 'moderate' with all of the footpaths and tracks on public rights-of-way within the County of Derbyshire. Crossings of the River Derwent are made at Duffield and Church Wilne.\nVillages included on the walk include\nQuarndon, Duffield, Little Eaton, Morley Smithy, Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Risley, Breaston, Draycott, Shardlow, Aston-on-Trent, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Barrow-on-Trent, Findern, Etwall, Dalbury, Lees, and Langley Common.\nThere are numerous pubs, cafes and tea rooms to offer refreshments at various points along the route.\nLinks to other walks in the Nomad Way series:\nWalk 1 of 5, Dale Abbey to Shardlow\n- Sat 11 October 2025\nWalk 2 of 5, Shardlow to Findern\n- Sat 18 October 2025\nWalk 3 of 5, Findern to Kirk Langley\n- Sat 22 November 2025\nWalk 4 of 5, Kirk Langley to Morley Smithy\n- Sat 29 November 2025\nWalk 5 of 5, Morley Smithy to Dale Abbey - 8.8 km (5.5 miles)\nWe will visit St. Matthew's Parish Church in\nMorley\nto discover some in-built remains from Dale Abbey and view the Sacheverell-Bateman Mausoleum. The (converted) Tithe Barn and Dovecote at Morley Hall are also of interest.\nTh Church of St. Andrew, much restored in 1875, retains a few Norman features from its 12th century origin, a 14th century font and interesting Jacobean Pulpit.\nStanley\nColliery, closed in 1959, was a drift-mine or 'footrill', nicknamed 'Nibbl'um or 'Nibby Pit' due to the coal-owners constantly cutting wages. In former times, the smooth white sandstone from Stanley Quarry was used to produce 'donkey-stones' used for polishing theshold steps. The 'White Hart' is open all day for refreshments.\nReturn bus service (Black Cat) to Derby available from Stanley.\nThis is 'The Flourish' and site of the former 'Stanhope Arms', on the old Derby-Nottingham route.

The path winds from riverside meadows towards wooded trails and chalky ridges, with plenty of chances to pause and take in sweeping views over the Surrey countryside. From the heights, the patchwork of fields, villages, and distant hills looks especially beautiful in the softer light of autumn.\nIt’s a walk that balances gentle climbs with rewarding vistas, perfect for catching up with your fellow hikers along the way. With the colours of the season all around us and good company at our side, this promises to be a refreshing day out in the Downs.\nTotal distance is 16 km (10 miles) with a 218 m (716 ft) of ascent spread throughout the route.

    "Summary": "Enjoy a pre-Christmas hike around the popular Happy Valley area of Coulsdon. The terrain will be varied and we'll see some stunning scenery on route. If that wasn't enough there are plenty of historic points and landmarks to keep us entertained. Near the end we can also enjoy a Christmas drink before our return.\nClick on this\nLink\nto view the route (opens OS Maps)\nA Few Features:\nFarthing Downs\nThe most extensive area of semi-natural downland left in London.  Views are offered over a great distance.  There are also cows roaming freely as they graze.  History is also paramount here.  The site is believed to go back to Neolithic times with evidence of a historical past dotted around.\nSt Peter and St Paul Church\nWork started on the church before 1086 and it is still in use today.  The church is famous for having a wall painting believed to have been done around 1170.  Amazingly, the painting was only discovered during restoration works in 1870-1.  It has been described as “perhaps the most interesting ancient wall-painting in England”.\nHappy Valley\nThe general name for the whole area.  Originally, things were known as the Coulsdon Greenbelt Lands.  That is obviously quite a stuffy name so in 1970 the name was changed to Happy Valley Park.\nSt Lawrence's Hospital Burial Ground\nThe Caterham Metropolitan Asylum, later known as St Lawrence’s Hospital opened in 1870. Between this time and 1915 the burial ground was used to facilitate the hospital.  The site is now a place of history but graves and a memorial garden remain.  The site of the former chapel is visible.\nCoulsdon Common\nAnother lovely green space where fields and woodland meet.  As with other areas we pass through it is easy to forget we are in London.\nKenley Airfield\nRAF Kenley was a main operating airfield from 1917 to 1959.  It saw heavy use during both World Wars.  Sadly, few buildings remain and the Control Tower itself was demolished following fire in 1978.  That said it is thought to be one of the best preserved Second World War RAF fighter stations.  Some land has been used for housing but the site is still active.  The RAF 2 Flying Training School are still an active presence. Due to this the site falls under the Ministry of Defence.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks. I just ask that owners please ensure they are kept on a lead as appropriate, especially around livestock and when near busy roads. Please, also remember that not everyone is a dog lover.\nDon’t Waste That Space!\nWalks get filled up quite quickly, so please only sign up if you know you are free to attend.

    "Summary": "If you have ever joined OutdoorLads for our Penpont Canoeing activity you will have visited Glasbury on Wye, but Christmas gives us a chance to explore the village and surrounding countryside, and it will probably be a bit cold for the canoeing at this time of year!\nThe Brecon Beacons are a short drive away, so hopefully we can arrange car sharing for those that prefer a more mountainous walk, or perhaps a more leisurely walk taking in Three Cocks (The village of).  For the cyclists amongst you there is the challenging Gospel Pass Loop, or as Glasbury is located a whole 5 miles away from Hay on Wye  you may prefer a visit to the many bookshops there.\nThe Accommodation\nThis is our first visit to this location, but you can expect dormitory style accommodation with some spare beds available allowing us to spread-out throughout the building, and with a bit of OutdoorLads festive magic, we'll soon have the common areas looking like Santa's Grotto!\nItinerary\nThe following is all subject to change but should give you and idea of what to expect if this is your first OutdoorLads Christmas event.\nFriday\nYou'll be able to arrive at the site from around 4pm on the Friday, and find the bed you've reserved (more details on this closer to the time). Once settled in, there is plenty of room to relax in the lounge, with hot drinks available throughout the weekend. If your preference is for an alcoholic tipple you'll need to bring these yourself.\nFriday evening will be jacket potatoes with a choice of fillings, but we're not completely forgetting the traditional OutdoorLads buffet. We'd like you to bring along something for desert or an offering for a cheese board to be set out on both evenings.\nOnce we've had a briefing over the plans for the weekend, we'll be looking for some volunteers to tidy up the kitchen and dining room, whilst the others can head back to relax in the lounge, or perhaps enjoy some board games (don't forget to bring your favourites).\nSaturday\nAfter breakfast on Saturday morning you'll head out on your choice of activity , returning to our accommodation early afternoon. This means you will likely need a packed lunch that you will need to bring yourself.\nFor those of you that like your ParkRun on a Saturday morning, the nearest is Hay on Wye and we'll try to arrange drivers for those that need it and time our daytime activities to give you a chance to do both.\nIF YOU ARE ATTENDING THE HOSTEL YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOOK ON THE EVENT PAGE TO ATTEND YOUR CHOICE OF ACTIVITIES.  THE PAGE IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION AND TO ALLOW LOCAL MEMBERS TO JOIN FOR THE DAY.\nPark Run\nThree Cocks Walk\nGlasbury & Boughrood\nWalk to Hay On Wye (After Parkrun)\nOutdoorLads hostel events always rely on everyone mucking in and helping in the kitchen over the weekend and Christmas is no different, so whilst a few volunteers are busy in the kitchen, we'll hopefully have some Christmas themed activities in the lounge including our traditional Secret Santa.\nIt wouldn't be a Christmas hostel without Christmas dinner. and you can expect a starter, traditional Christmas roast, vegan option and all the trimmings followed by dessert.\nWe'll need some volunteers to clear up in the kitchen and dining room, but once that's done it will be a chance to relax and digest, there could be some music on but I'm sure the board games will be in full swing again.\nSunday\nStart the day with breakfast and as much coffee as needed to recover from the night before, and then we'll spend an hour or so tidying up the venue and leaving it as clean, or even cleaner than we found it.\nOur plan is to offer a short walk or cultural event on the Sunday for those that are not in a hurry to leave, but this is subject to volunteers stepping up to lead this for you!\nGood to Know....\nDogs\nSorry, this event is not suitable for dogs. Registered assistance animals are welcome, but please let us know at the time of booking if you will be bringing an assistance dog.\nCar Sharing\nChristmas is the time for sharing, so if driving to the event please consider offering spare seats to other members heading the same way.   Why not add your details to the\ncar share pag\ne and we'll provide a Telegram Chat room nearer the time.\nWant to Get Out More?\nWhy not check out the South Wales and South West Calendar\nhere\n.\nOutdoorLads Foundation\nFancy coming along but having a difficult time of it (for whatever reason), and/or finding it hard to justify the expense?

    "Summary": "'Hurst' in a place name means 'wooded hill', and these wooded hills will be stocked with seasonal shrubs such as holly, ivy, spruce and so forth. Starting by car or bus amid such woods we'll ascend Woolbeding Common, pause to appreciate the panorama, and then descend to the valley of the River Rother and the spick-and-span timelessness of the town of Midhurst. Here we'll split up and have an hour and a bit to find places to look at and lunch at. At a set time we'll meet up to complete the walk, finding further quiet corners, fir tree forests and historic homes (chief among them the imposing ruins of Cowdray House) and generally delighting in the Christmassy company of our fellow OutdoorLads.\nThe sights:\nHenley:\nA straggle of picturesque cottages and farms on the edge of Verdley Hill. There are superb views back to Blackdown Hill. The Duke of Cumberland Arms pub is C16.\nWoolbeding Common:\nOak, sweet chestnut, birch and rowan growing on the greensand give way to bilberry, gorse and heather. These areas don't feel like Sussex but more like the edge of Dartmoor. Birdlife includes green and greater spotted woodpeckers and perhaps resident linnets and stonechats. The heath has always provided local people with heather to burn and now the\nNational Trust\nis cutting back birch trees to prevent forest taking over the biodiverse heathland. There are superb views from the highest point across the Weald to the South Downs.\nWoolbeding:\nThe first village on the River Rother west out of Midhurst. All Hallows Church is tall, unaisled, Saxon, but restoration has removed most character and the chancel is from 1870. Woolbeding Hall is a delightful house of 1700, with French-looking additions of 1875. Home from 1972 until his death in 2006 to businessman, philanthropist and art collector Simon Sainsbury, and later his civil partner Stewart Grimshaw. The National Trust opens the\ngardens\n. Woolbeding Bridge is C14. Kinetic Greenhouse (it opens like a flower), 2021, designed by Thomas Heatherwick to display plants from the Silk Road. Cedra, water sculpture by William Pye, 2011.\nMidhurst:\nTo quote my go-to topographer Ian Nairn in\nThe Buildings of England: Sussex\n: 'To the main road traveller, Midhurst, like Petworth, is a bewildering series of acute ninety-degree bends combined with an inexplicable cottagey cosiness in the buildings, so different from the open market-places of Hampshire. Few towns are more deceptive, few towns withhold themselves so firmly until the traveller gets out of his car and on to his feet: few towns in particular have a more exciting relationship with the surrounding countryside'. The parish church (St Mary Magdalene and St Denys) is disappointing: some parts are C13, but most seems to be from the restoration of 1882. It overlooks a pleasant if rather empty square. The Spread Eagle Hotel is 1700, the Old Market House is C16, Market Hall (Now Eagle House) is 1552 with an C18 front. The former library is a ramble of tiled and timbered cottages of the C17. The biggest building is Cowdray House, just NE of the town, the epitome of sober but splendid Tudor architecture, dating from 1492 to 1542. It was left a ruin by a fire in 1793 and so spared from being Victorianized.\nEasebourne:\nA Cowdray Estate village (identified by yellow paintwork), mostly sandstone with some timber framing. Many good C19 estate cottages. Sycamore Cottage is C16 and the best of a mile of cottages that stretches up the village's High Street. St Mary is a priory church from the C13, but almost everything is now of 1876. Easebourne Priory was founded in 1238 and what is left are the buildings around the cloister which now form an amalgam of medieval, C17 and C18 design.\nThe\nroute\n(please click on the link in red to be taken to the Ordnance Survey website):\nThe westwards Serpent Trail will take us along Verdley Edge to the highest point of Woolbeding Common. Paths heading south will bring us to Eastshaw Lane which will bring us to Woolbeding village. Heading further south over the bridge, we'll almost get to the A272 and the western edge of Midhurst. After an hour exploring the town and finding food and a place to eat it, we'll meet up again, ascend St Anne's Hill, then proceed along the River Rother past Cowdray. A gravel track in the grounds of the house will take us to Easebourne where we'll walk along the High Street, then Easebourne Street north to Whitters Copse. At Verdley Farm we'll pick up a footpath heading west back to Henley.\nDogs:\nI love having dogs on my walks and this walk is suitable for them, except that there will be a number of stiles to cross (you may have to lift your muddy beast over them), lanes to walk along, a few fields with livestock and the town of Midhurst where they might not be welcome in cafés (although being Sussex, they probably will). Any dog off the lead must be obedient.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

    "Summary": "On this circular riverside walk through Rotherhithe, Bermondsey, Wapping, the Isle of Dogs and Greenwich, we'll admire the feats of engineering and infrastructure that made London Docklands the busiest port in the world. We’ll trace the wood-built wharves, weathered warehouses, and winding waterways that once buzzed with tea and tobacco, coffee and cocoa, sugar and spice. We’ll enjoy the crisp air and festive cheer, with twinkling lights reflecting off the Thames. We’ll cross under the river via the Greenwich Foot Tunnel, and perhaps explore the Brunel Museum’s vault ('the eighth wonder of the world'). We’ll hug and huddle, celebrate history and heritage, and look ahead to the holiday.\nThe sights and\nroute\n:\nWe'll start our walk at Canada Water Station. A short walk north along Albatross Way, SwanRoad and Railway Avenue is...\n1. The Brunel Museum:\nCommemorates the pioneering engineering of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his father Marc Isambard Brunel, particularly the construction of the Thames Tunnel (1825–1843). This was the first underwater tunnel beneath a navigable river, a groundbreaking achievement in civil engineering termed 'The eighth wonder of the world' by an American journalist. Entrance costs £9.50 and you get to experience the deep, wide Victorian tunnel shaft.\nHeading southeast along the Thames Path towards Rotherhithe Street, we'll see....\n2. St Mary’s, Rotherhithe:\nPretty brick exterior with classical detailing, designed by architect John James, an associate of Sir Christopher Wren. Construction began in 1714 and was completed in 1716. Due to financial constraints, the tower was not finished until 1747, when it was completed by Lancelot Dowbiggin.\nHeading west, we'll walk along...\n3. Shad Thames and Butler's Wharf:\nWarehouses built late C18–early C19 for tea, tobacco, and spice storage, feature tall brick façades, cast-iron galleries, bridges and hoists, They now house apartments and offices. Redevelopment preserves industrial character, Used in 1983 to film scenes from Doctor Who:\nResurrection of the Daleks,\nnotably the shooting of the prisoners and the pushing of a dalek out of a window.\nHeading north along Tower Bridge Road we'll cross...\n4. Tower Bridge:\nCompleted in 1894 by Horace Jones and John Wolfe-Barry, this bascule-and-suspension bridge combines Gothic revival detailing with functional Victorian engineering. Its twin towers, steel framework, and lifting mechanism exemplify industrial ingenuity, while its dramatic form creates a globally recognizable London landmark.\nGoing west beside the Tower we'll finish at the...\n5. Tower of London:\nFounded by William the Conqueror (1078), this fortress and palace evolved through Norman, Tudor, and Victorian additions. Its White Tower, defensive walls, and medieval towers reflect military strategy and royal authority. Historically a prison and treasury, it symbolizes monarchy, law, and London’s evolving urban landscape. This is where we'll have lunch.\nGoing north around the Tower, we'll cross under Tower Bridge Road to reach...\n6. Dickens Inn, St Katherine Docks:\nReconstructed C18 timber-framed pub. It wasn’t originally located here, being relocated from Shad Thames. The connection with Dickens is tenuous: it was opened by his grandson in honour of his grandfather.\nGoing east along St Katharine’s Way to the dock entrance, we'll reach...\n7. St Katherine Docks:\nGeorgian warehouses converted into luxury marina housing. Noted for harmony of classical proportions with functional dock design. One of London’s first fully enclosed docks (1828).\nWe’ll walk northeast along St Katharine’s Way to the...\n8. Hermitage Wall:\nMedieval defensive wall fragment. Architecturally unremarkable, but historically significant as a rare surviving City fortification.\nThen we'll use the Thames Path heading east through Wapping to...\n9. Wapping Pier Head:\nIndustrial brick quay with iron fittings. Utilitarian aesthetic, little ornamentation but very elegant. The pier marks the former Wapping Basin entrance to the Thames. Used as a filming location in the Doctor Who story\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977), where the villain's henchman Chang searches for his master's Time Cabinet in the foggy London streets.\nGoing east along Wapping High Street, we'll get to...\n10. Wapping Old Stairs: C17\nriver steps. Narrow, picturesque, evocative of historic river commerce. Once a notorious smuggling spot. Used as a filming location in\nThe Talons of Weng Chiang\n(1977) where an old crone leads the police to a mutilated body floating in the river, exclaiming: \"On my oath! You wouldn’t want that served with onions! Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Ugh! Make an 'orse sick, that would!\"\nHeading north along Wapping Lane, we'll find...\n11. Wapping Woods:\nA small green space amid former industrial land.\nWe’ll walk east along Wapping Lane and Thomas More Street, following the Thames Path to...\n12. Tobacco Dock:\nAn 1811 warehouse designed by John Rennie the Elder whose use of brick and iron was praised for its elegance and durability. Later event-space conversions sometimes clash with its original proportions. Originally for imported tobacco, one of London’s largest bonded warehouses.\nGoing east along Wapping Lane and Narrow Street, we'll continue on the Thames Path through Shadwell to...\n13. Shadwell Basin:\nC19 dock basin with simple brick warehouses. Now residential.\nWe’ll then walk north along Wapping Wall, following the Thames Path to...\n14. Prospect of Whitby:\nEvocative C16 riverside tavern with timber beams and low ceilings. Once frequented by sailors and smugglers.\nHeading north along Wapping Wall, we'll reach...\n15. Wapping Hydraulic Power Station:\nBrick and iron industrial structure, built 1890. Supplied hydraulic power to London docks originally by coal and steam, then by electricity. Exterior now overshadowed by surrounding modern developments.\nGoing east along Wapping Wall, using the Thames Path, we'll reach...\n16. The Grapes:\nEarly C18 riverside pub; elegant Georgian frontage. Charles Dickens referenced it in\nOur Mutual Friend.\nWe’ll walk east along Wapping Lane, Limehouse Link, and Aspen Way, following the Thames Path near the dock edges to reach...\n17. West India Docks:\nEarly C19 dock complex; William Jessop’s engineering praised for functionality. Major hub for Caribbean sugar and rum trade. Plain but elegant warehouses contrast sharply with nearby modern Canary Wharf.\nHeading northeast within West India Docks. we'll get to...\n18. Brown's Building:\nFormer warehouse with red brick and steel. Adaptive reuse for offices preserves industrial feel.\nGoing north along Hertsmere Road is the location of the...\n19. Museum of London Docklands:\n1802 sugar warehouse with John Rennie’s brickwork praised for its proportion. Preserves Docklands history and is converted sensitively.\nWe’ll walk east along Hertsmere Road and West India Avenue into...\n20. Canary Wharf:\nA landmark postmodern financial district masterplanned by César Pelli and Norman Foster in the late 1980s. Towering skyscrapers, including One Canada Square (235 m, 1991) and HSBC Tower (200 m, 1990). The glass-and-steel façades convey sleek modernity. Elevated plazas, public art, and interconnected pedestrian routes offer civic spaces, yet some feel the uniformity prioritizes corporate aesthetics over human-scale warmth.\nHeading adjacent to Canary Wharf we'll get to...\n21. West India Quay:\nC19 warehouses. Preserved dockside character amidst modern commercial redevelopment.\nGoing southeast along Aspen Way and Millwall Dock we'll reach....\n22. Millwall Docks:\nFunctional C19 dock basin. Now residential; retains water and quay walls. Warehouses’ architectural charm largely lost in redevelopment.\nWe’ll walk southeast along Manchester Road and Tunnel Approach, heading to Greenwich through the...\n23. Greenwich Foot Tunnel:\nEdwardian cast-iron pedestrian tunnel designed by Maurice Fitzmaurice. The elegant tiled interior seems narrow and constraining, but still a great engineering achievement.\nWe'll emerge from the tunnel to see the...\n24. Cutty Sark:\nAn 1869 clipper designed by Hercules Linton. Fastest tea clipper of its era. Sitting in a purpose-built dry dock which is partially successful: it preserves the ship for public viewing offering tourist-friendly walkways and interpretive spaces. However, the surrounding modern glass 'float' feels intrusive and the maritime connection is lost.\nAnd it is here that we'll finish the walk.\nDogs:\nDogs are welcome on this walk but it's in an urban setting and so they won't be able to go off the lead much.\n(Image credits: River Thames at Ratcliff:\nPhoto\n©\nMarathon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Tower Bridge, 2004:\nPhoto\n©\nMisterweiss\n(\ncc-by-sa/4.0\n); The Dickens Inn, St Katharine Docks, London E1:\nPhoto\n©\nChristine Matthews\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Pier Head, Wapping, former entrance lock to the London Docks:\nPhoto\n©\nChristopher Hilton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Limehouse Cut:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Heaton\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Prospect of Whitby:\nPhoto\n©\nChris Allen\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); North Dock and West India Quay, Canary Wharf:\nPhoto\n©\nRobin Stott\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); The Cutty Sark, Greenwich:\nPhoto\n©\nJThomas\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Brunel Museum, Rotherhithe:\nPhoto\n©\nJim Osley\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Shad Thames:\nPhoto\n©\nPAUL FARMER\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); Tower of London and River Thames:\nPhoto\n©\nAndrew Abbott\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n); St Mary with All Saints, Rotherhithe:\nPhoto\n©\nJohn Salmon\n(\ncc-by-sa/2.0\n).

    "Summary": "The full price of the event is £516 for full and concession members, and £586 for PAYG members.\nDue to overwhelming interest in this event and in order to be as fair as possible to all those that wish to attend, we are having to implement a revised booking system for this event. No pre-bookings will now be taken for the event, except for the event leader. When the event opens on Thursday 25th September at 7pm, it will be via this event page and will require payment of £103.20 (20% of the full member price) as a deposit. Those that sign up will be sent an invoice for the remaining balance (£412.80 for full members) to pay via bank transfer, credit / debit card, or you can arrange to pay the remainder in instalments. Payment, or an plan for instalments, must be made by 27th October 2025 or your place will be considered cancelled. The full balance must be paid by 1st June 2026.\nFrom Friday 26th September, this event page will revert to showing the full price so people can book on and pay in the usual way, but we will also accept people contacting the office to ask to pay in instalments.\nSpend a week in the beautiful hills outside Rome and #getoutmore in Italy!  After almost 9 years, ODL returns to this beautiful 1,600 year old monastery 45 minutes northeast of Rome.  Fully modernised and capable of accommodating 12 guests, this building will be our base for a week of hiking and cultural immersion in the Lazio region.\nThis is a week away in Italy where the focus will be on getting out more and exploring the area on foot, enjoying the views and sights and the company of fellow OutdoorLads members; and a chance to enjoy the culture and tourist sights of Italy, too, rather than a chill-out holiday. So come and enjoy fantastic break away with us and get acquainted with this beautiful region!\nOur accommodation at the monastery features four twin-bedded rooms, and two double rooms (if you are coming as a couple or friends who don't mind sharing, please let the leader know!) and a full kitchen. Simple breakfasts, and tea and coffee are provided all week, as are two group evening meals. For the other evening meals you can self-cater, eat out, or those that wish to can shop, cook at eat together as a group - we can make arrangements for that when we arrive.\nNo transport is included, you will need to book and pay for all your own travel including flights and transport to the accommodation, and any transport whilst there. There is parking for four cars at the monastery if you wish to hire a car, but this would be at your own additional cost.\nItinerary and arrangements\nThe (adjustable) itinerary will look something like this. Please note that most tickets for attractions cannot be booked until at least 75 days in advance.  You would need to book and pay for tickets for any of these yourself, they are not included in the price.\nFriday 24 July\nShould you arrive at the monastery before 16.00, you will need to wait in the courtyard as there will be no access into the building.  I will meet the housekeeper at 16.00 and will need time to go through the preliminaries before allowing everyone in.\nThe train from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport (Fiumicino Airport) to\nTivoli\ntakes around 2.5 hours, with a change required in Rome. Tickets can be booked on the\nTrenitalia\nwebsite, for an advance cost of around €11 one way.\nPay close attention to what you book as some of the journeys actually go to Rome Tiburtina station and then involve a bus to Tivoli. Make sure you do not book to Tivoli Terme, as that is 30 minutes before Tivoli itself.\nThere are no activities planned for today, other than a communal dinner buffet.\nSaturday 25 July\nPlan on an early start to enjoy this (slightly longer than) 8.15km\nGrotto delle sirene\nloop through the village of Tivoli. We will walk down to the village from the monastery to the \"official\" starting point. This route covers very gently rolling village streets and paths, with an elevation gain of 160 metres and a loss of 150 metres.  Good trainers or walking shoes should should be adequate.\nLunch can either be brought from the monastery or can be purchased from one of the local shops.  Alternatively a trattoria lunch can be arranged at the end of the walk, as we will be in the village.\nSunday 26 July\nAs this is the last Sunday of the month the Vatican Museums\nMIGHT\nbe free (at least they were in 2025). If we decide to do this, the last entry into the Museum is at 12.30 so we would plan on leaving the monastery early, to try and avoid the queues as much as possible. Please note that shorts are\nNOT\nallowed inside the Vatican.\nThe Sistine Chapel is included on the free day, St Peter's Basillica is also free to enter but there will be security queues.\nAdditionally, for those interested there may be the option of attending the\nSunday Angelus\nin St Peter's Square, starting at 12.30. Please note that this only takes place when the Pope is in residence at the Vatican.  I will check the schedule as this day gets closer.\nFor those that prefer to stay at the monastery you will need to ensure that you have all your daily supplies as the shops and stores in Tivoli will most likely be closed today. There is the option of visiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n, but cannot be booked until Spring 2026.\nDinner may be a cookout at the monastery or some restaurants may be open.\nMonday 27 July\nAnother early start will see us exploring this 11.5km\nPonte Nomentano\n\"linear\" loop along the Aniene River. This requires the use of public transport (50 minutes by bus each way) or private car to the start / end point and that will be advised upon during the event.\nThis walk is completely flat, along the banks of the Anien River.  Good trainers or walking shoes should be adequate, but bear in mind there may be mud if there has been any rain. There are several restuarants / cafes at the 6km turn-around point that might work for lunch; we will just need to see what is open.\nTuesday 28 July\nToday will see us venturing into Rome to explore this ancient city.  Independent options could include:\nRome \"hop on - hop off\" bus tour;\nTickets\nshould be purchased in advance, starting at €26 per person.\nExplore the city on your own, taking in sites like Vatican City, the\nColosseum\n(multiple ticket options, starting from €53) or the \"\nEat, Pray, Love\n\" movie\nfilming locations\ntour.\nExplore\nSt Peter's Basillica\n(free to enter but there will be long security queues)\nFor the foodies you can try and visit the 13 best\ngelaterias\nin Rome!\nExplore the\nJewish Ghetto\n, which actually dates back to 1555 when it was created by Pope Paul IV Carafa.\nBe the ultimate tourist and toss coins into the Trevi Fountain (one coin \"ensures\" your return to Rome, two coins increases your chances of finding true love in the near future, and three coins ensures coins 1 and 2, as well as ensuring marriage in the Eternal City - coins must be tossed over your right shoulder using your left hand), walk down the Spanish Steps, or stroll down the\nVia Condotti\n(Rome's luxury shopping street).\nPartake in any one of the free (only pay what you want)\nwalking tours\nof Rome.\nAs the streets are virtually all cobblestone, good, solid soled shoes are highly recommended. Dinner this evening will be a special event (paid individually), at a restaurant in Rome to be decided upon later.\nWednesday 29 July\nToday we venture \"uphill\" from the monastery, taking in this 12.8km\nSughereta di Sirividola\nloop. This hike starts just down the main road from the monastery so no transport is needed. This hike is mostly on mountain paths, with an elevation gain of 460 metres and a loss of 450 metres.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nAnother option, if you so desire, could be returning to Rome to attend the free\nPapal Audience\nin St Peter's Square.  Again this is obviously ties to the Holy Father's summer schedule.`\nDinner this evening can either be communal back at the monastery or at any of the local tavernas.\nThursday 30 July\nToday is our last full day in this incredible location so let's make the most of it! For those that are not too knackered from yesterday's hike, there is this 8.45km\nTivoli to Monte Catillo\nloop through the hills above Tivoli. This hike should be a bit less strenuous than yesterday's but still has an elevation gain of 330 metres, and a loss of the same.  Hiking shoes or boots are strongly recommended.\nFor those not interested in hiking today, cultural options include:\nVisiting the gardens of the\nVilla d'Este\nin Tivoli; Tickets are €17.00 and must be booked in advance on the\nticketing website\n. Please note that you cannot book tickets until Spring 2026.\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the village, following any one of these 3\nitineraries\n.\nCompletely spoil yourself at the\nAqua Albule\nthermal spa, about 20 minutes by train from Tivoli. Use of the pool is around €17; full access to the thermal spa is around €45 and includes use of the sauna, \"flavoured\" and \"sailing\" showers (don't ask as I have no idea!!!) and hydrotherapy. Please note that ODL accepts no responsibility for your use of these facilities.  As always you should check with your GP to see if these services are right for you.\nDinner tonight will be a communal affair at the monastery, with a special \"theme\" to be announced early in the week.\nFriday 31 July\nSadly, our Roman adventure comes to an end today.  We will need to check out of the monastery by 10.00am, before which we will do the traditional \"ODL hostel clean\".\nIf you are flying back to the UK today please try not to book your departing flight before 16.00, as it is at least 2 hours on the bus / train, including a change in Rome.\nIf you are staying on in Rome for any additional days, please do not book your transport from Tivoli before 11.00, in order for everyone to participate in the clean-up.\nRome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) is served by virtually every major airport in the UK, using EasyJet, RyanAir, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling and WizzAir.  Rome Ciampino Airport (approximately 1 hour south of Rome) is served by RyanAir (from Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and London Stansted - please note that flight days can vary).\nShould you wish to arrive in Rome before the 24th, or stay after the 31st, please note that all costs will be your own to incur and you will not be able to stay on longer at the monastery.\nIt is strongly recommended that you secure travel insurance to cover not only the hiking activities, but also flight delay or cancellation, baggage delays, medical care and, if necessary, repatriation.\nPay in instalments\nIf you would prefer to pay in monthly instalments, please\ncontact the office team\n(or\nraise a support ticket\n) and we can discuss the options available to you, depending on the time available between booking and the event taking place. There will be additional terms and conditions to agree to before you commit. You won't pay anything extra to pay in instalments. This is how the event leader has chosen to pay - so it's no hardship.\nExamples of instalment options, but we're happy to discuss options with you:\nBook during October: Eight payments of £64.50\nBook during November: Seven payments of £73.72\nBook during December: Six payments of £86.\nYou will need to have fully paid up by the start of June.\nPhotos:\nPhotos provided\nwww.unsplash.com\n, OutdoorLads members and the monastery and used by OutdoorLads with full permission.",

Because of this different emphasis, bouldering doesn't have the hassle of climbing with ropes, harnesses and belaying, which makes the activities excellent for newcomers to the sport.\nIf you're a seasoned climber you won't need convincing about the benefits of bouldering, but for those who've never climbed more than a staircase, the benefits are wide ranging: from the physical - improved strength, tone, balance, power and coordination; mental - problem solving, focus, concentration and body awareness; to the emotional - relaxation, a sense of achievement and a feeling that mind and body are working together perfectly ('feeling psyched'). On top of all this, bouldering tends to be a very social sport where you can hang out with mates and each have a go as you feel regardless of what level you climb at.\nI'm new to Bouldering - can I come along?\nIf you have never tried bouldering before it is recommended that you have a guided session from the event leader, who will go through everything you will need to know to boulder safely before joining in with the rest of the group.\nAll those attending the event must also be aware of the centre's own terms and conditions of participation and abide by them, along with any instructions given by the centre’s staff. Everyone must also take responsibility for their own safety while participating in Indoor climbing events.\nI've been Bouldering before...\nAs above, everyone attending the event must abide by the centre's T&Cs etc. As an experienced boulderer you are at all times responsible for your own safety, actions and involvement. As such, you should use your own judgement in taking up advice given either by OutdoorLads Volunteers or other experienced climbers.\nHow Do I Sign Up?\nIf you are not already registered with Big Rock, please do so\nHERE\n. As well as signing up to this OutdoorLads event page you will need to pay Big Rock for a session. This can be done on the day of the event at entry. As before, we'd ask that all members sign up through the event page to make sure the event leader has all information of the members attending.\nCan't make this event?\nWe run weekly climbing and bouldering events in the South East, so why not check out what's coming up near you here:\nhttp://outdoorlads.events/SouthEastIndoorClimbing\n.

In the daytime there are guided groups that you can join for skiing or snowboarding where you will meet lots of other gay guys, and rendezvous restaurants where multiple groups meet for lunch. In the evening there are parties every nite some are themed (fancy dress) and are great fun. In between there is apres ski at the end of the day and the spa (if you have access) .\nFor more info:-\nEuropean Snow Pride website\n.\nEuropean Snow Pride on facebook\n.\nPLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO EUROPEAN SKIING EVENTS THIS ONE, (EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE ESP) AND EUROPEAN GAY SKI WEEK  EGSW SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNING UP TO THE ONE YOU WANT TO ATTEND , ESPECIALLY IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE BOOKED ON ONE. THIS EVENT IS FOR EUROPEAN SNOW PRIDE in TIGNES\nThere is a WhatsApp group to assist people in communicating to book / share accommodation and to communicate and arrange to meet up whilst there. See the link in the location information below to join.\nPlease read the info on here carefully and on the ESP website, feel free to ask questions on the comments section below or in the whatsapp group.\nACCOMMODATION\nThere are lots of options see the\nEuropean Snow Pride website\nfor details.\nWhen booking for accommodation is open. I recommend booking ASAP as the best accommodation offers sell out early and the cost increases a little every month !\nThere are standard accommodation options that are eligible for the outdoorlads discount (\n€35 pp for non special offer accom booked with an Event Pass+6 day lift pass see\nODL Discount\n.), and there are the special offer accoms ranging from approx £400 to £700 these are already really good value so they are not discounted.\nYou will need to pay 25% on booking and the remainder 1 month before the event.\nI will be booking the deluxe special offer (£764pp (increases monthly)), a lot of the outdoorlads book this as is really good value and it makes shareing with other outdoorlads simple. The apartments are great, it is close to the slopes and it has access to the fantastic spa. This includes both event and lift passes. So just flights, transfers and spending money on top.\nThe apartments are for 5 people but you don't need to arrange who you are sharing with till later so I recommend booking to secure a place as this will sell out. (There are lots of other options and the non special offer accom is eligible for discount). If you are on a tight budget the standard special is great value at £500.\nIf you have got your own group together then great , if not message on the WhatsApp group , see link in the location information below to join the group, ask if any other outdoorlads are looking to share. With the special offer accom , snowpride will allocate you an apartment with others you request to share with and/or will fill spaces with others on snowpride. I have shared with others i didn't know in the past and found it a great way to make new friends.\nSKIING/SNOWBOARDING\nThere are daily guided groups for intermediate and advanced skiers/boarders and ski school available for beginners. This year each guided group will be accompanied by an ESP promoter and a professional ski guide from evolution 2.\nEuropean Snow Pride Ski options\n.\nYou can hire  your equipment  from ESP also.\nEVENT PASS ETC\nTo participate in the ski groups, a client must either purchase an Event Pass Premium, or an Event Pass Standard plus a supplement for ski and snowboard groups.\nThe standard includes the evening parties but not the daytime guided ski groups or the pool party.\nThis makes it more flexible so that if you do not use the guided ski groups or go to the pool party it will be cheaper for you. You can add the pool party or the guided groups to the Standard pass as an optional extra.\nIf you are intending to do the guided ski groups and pool party then it is more cost effective to get the premium.\nFull details on the types of event pass here;:\nhttps://www.europeansnowpride.com/fr/pass-evenement-gay-ski-week/\nGETTING THERE\nYou need to organise your own transport .\nSee\nEuropean Snow Pride travel options\n.\nWhen booking flights to the resort the transfers usually leave the airports before 3pm on Saturday and are not likely to arrive back at the airport until after 3pm on the return journey. So please bear this in mind when booking flights. (As in, early flight on arrival and late flight on return. There have been many occasions with a late return transfer as Saturday is change over day for the whole of the french alps! The traffic is usually extremely congested, do not be misled by google travel times that are not for Saturday! Several people have missed flights booked too early in the day.)\n(ESP photos copyright Franck Weens\nwww.weens.fr\nand Andréa Emmanuelli - Lezak\nwww.andrew-grey.com\nand European Snow Pride)",

Having said that, even though this is a beginners mountain walk, you will still have to have a minumum level of fitness required. Therefore, we recommend only registering for this walk if you can walk the same distance on a relatively flat terrain.\nThe Route\nThe route up to Ingleborough from Clapham is perhaps the finest and most scenic. We start in the picturesque village of Clapham, complete with a river running through the middle. From here we walk along good country tracks gently up through a woodland, and then drop down to the riverside as the valley gets narrower.\nWe follow this river until we meet some classic Yorkshire Dales limestone crags and head through a narrow gorge where there are small bolts drilled in for climbers. But you have to look closely!\nOnce through this dramatic gorge, we begin striking up toward Ingleborough on good tracks. Open farmland gives way to open moorland and we'll begin to see the summit of Ingleborough in the distance. The summit itself is a large wide plateau - once used as an Iron Age hill fort.\nOnce we've taken a picture or two of the group (and any views if we're not in the middle of a cloud), we'll retrace our steps back. On the return route though, we'll continue along the river all the way through the forest back into Clapham.\nPost-Walk Food\nIt's not part of the official trip, but we may see if we can stay on for a pub meal for those that want to. But we'll decide on the day!\nDogs\nWell-behaved dogs are welcome on this walk but, like the owner, you must be certain your dog can do both the distance and the climb (up and down).\nIf the event is fully booked:\nplease join the waiting list as people frequently drop out during the week before an event and you are likely to get a place on the walk.\nYour First OutdoorLads Event?\nWe know that new members in particular like to know in advance more about what an OutdoorLads event will be like.\nIf this is your first OutdoorLads event, you should check out the information designed specifically for you on the\nMy First Event\npage on the OutdoorLads website.\nIMPORTANT! - Participation Statement\nYou MUST complete a\nParticipation Statement\n,\nin addition\nto booking your event space before attending an OutdoorLads event.

The hospice was built in 1050 to shelter and rescue travellers crossing the pass.  Since the 17th century, the Saint-Bernard dogs have been bred by the monks of the hospice to come to the aid of travellers caught in snowstorms.\nNo prior snowshoe experience is necessary. You will be taught how to use the snow shoes on the first day on an easy trek into the Swiss mountain winter wonderland. If you have always wanted to get into the snowy mountains of the Alps but not been a skier take a look at this trip.\nThis trip starts at\nMartigny train station\nat 16:00 on the 12th March. There is a direct train from Geneva airport which takes about 2 hours.\nOur trip organizer (and OutdoorLads Member) Nick Read, is a qualified and experienced International Mountain Leader and expedition guide who runs\nPride Expeditions\n.  He first led an OutdoorLads trip to Everest Base Camp in 2014 and a white water raft trip on the Sun Kosi in 2012.\nWhat is included?\nAll Accomodation\nUIMLA International Mountain Leader\nAll Breakfasts and Dinners\nEntry to\nBarry Land\na theme park dedicated to the dogs\nSnow shoes and walking poles\nSafety equipment  (including avalanche transceiver and shovel)\nWhat is not included?\nFlights to and from Geneva airport\nTravel to and from Martigny train station\nLunches and drinks\nInsurance - you will need winter sports insurance\nSledging or visit to Spa (optional extras are 25 CHF)\nMore information on this trip is available from the\nPride Expeditions website\nItinerary\nDay 1  (12th March 2026) Arrival and travel to Martigny for 1600\nOn arrival in Geneva there is a direct train from Geneva Airport to  Martigny train station which takes about two hours. We will be picked up there and settle into our hotel for the night. You will be given all the equipment you need for snowshoeing.\nDay 2 (13th March) Snow shoe skills journey  10km 500m of ascent and descent\nWe’ll complete a short journey into the Swiss wilderness in order to learn to use the snow shoes and how to move with ease. We will also cover safety aspects to ensure you stay safe during the trip.\nIn the afternoon you can relax with a glass of wine or visit the local spa. We will overnight for a second night in the hotel near Martigny.\nDay 3 (14th March) Journey to the hospice 7km with 600m ascent\nToday after packing our bags for the night we will ascend to the Grand Saint Bernard Hospice. We will have lunch with the monks then continue the journey crossing into Italy before heading back to the hospice for the night. Dinner will once again be with the monks and there is optional attendance at Vespers (evening prayer).\nDay 4 (15th March) Return from the hospice 7km with 600m descent\nToday after breakfast and packing your bags we descend back to the valley. We will visit a Laiterie to learn about alpine cheese making and try some cheese and then go onto\nBarryLand\n. This is home to the Saint-Bernard dog, and a cuddle is welcomed.\nYou will be dropped off at Martigny train station at 1500 to catch a train back to Geneva or onwards. You will need to organize your own flights to Geneva and train ticket to Martigny from\nSwiss Rail\n.\nHow fit do I need to be?\nWe will be moving at a gentle pace when snowshoeing. Although it is a bit harder than walking it is not an extreme sport. We will be out in conditions that could be very bright and sunny or cold and snowy. It is more the ability to cope with these conditions that is important. If you would be happy going for a gentle winter walk in any conditions in the UK mountains you will find this trip straightforward.\nPhoto Credits: Tom Brodie for use to promote the event.\nHow to Book\nTo book your place on this trip (or secure a place on the waiting list) please pay a £215 deposit directly to\nPride Expeditions\n.
