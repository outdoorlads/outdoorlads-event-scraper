We are trialling delayed booking for all day walks in the Northeast and Yorkshire Region to reduce waiting lists and late cancellations. We know that a significant number of members who book places on our walks eventually decide not to attend the event. This causes long waiting lists and makes it harder for those who wish to attend an event to obtain a place. If you are interested in attending this event, please click the ‘bookmark’ button to add this page to your list of bookmarked events. This will make it easier for you to find the page when the event opens for bookings.",

The Twee: The model village and the cottages orné of Shanklin Old Village - twee, but enjoyably so. The Wowee: The prettiest villages on the island (Godshill and Shanklin Old Village), the highest hill and best view likewise (St Boniface Down)(Plus, the 'aah factor': we'll drop in on the freebie Isle of Wight Donkey Sanctuary!)",

The route takes us alongside the famous Great Western Railway line, providing an opportunity for the train enthusiasts amongst us to witness some familiar trains passing by, against a backdrop of dramatic cliffs and the sparkling sea.  before re-joining the main road and the Southwest Coast path over Holcombe hill to the newly constructed sea wall at Dawlish. Once arrived in the town centre we’ll find a Café or Pub and buy some lunch & drinks, which will give us the opportunity to have a social chat amongst ourselves or talk with leaders to share ideas. For those who are new members this is a great time to get to know each other and to find out what ODL is all about.After lunch we’ll make our way back to Dawlish railway station to catch the train back to Teignmouth, or make our own way home.We will be walking for around two hours. There are several steps during part of the walk and a couple of hills but otherwise it is a mainly easy walk. Depending on weather conditions, the footpaths could be muddy in places, so you may want to bring walking boots rather than trainers. DOGS: Well-trained and quiet dogs are more than welcome to join us, provided they remain under control. Authorities have placed signage in certain areas, clearly indicating where dogs must be leashed.",

Braemar is a beautiful Scottish village which is heaven for walkers, climbers and cyclists. There are no less than 24 Munros (mountains over 3000 ft high) as well as over 65 miles of high level walks and cycle routes of varying length and difficulty.The actual activities will vary depending on the weather at the time with a variety of different walks, cycling and running. We also hope to run a conservation/volunteering event (similar to those on offer at the Cairngorms event in May).  There will also be the opportunity to visit Balmoral Castle, a local Whisky Distillery or visit other attractions in the area! Each evening, an event message will be sent to all attendees so you’ll be able to see what’s on offer each day and to keep you updated of any changes, along with all the events listed on the whiteboard under the gazebo.  The meeting place for all events will be at Braemar Lodge.You will need to book your own accommodation separately. The leaders are staying at Braemar Lodge self catering log cabins. There are plenty accommodation options in the village to suit different budgets, including a recently renovated Youth Hostel and numerous Air BnB’s, self-catering cabins and a Campsite next door with tent pitches , campervan/caravan spaces and camping pods available. Have a google, or message the event leaders if you are struggling to find places. There is a small charge to cover the cost of running the events for this trip. However, OutdoorLads will be including a welcome drink on the first evening, and providing a BBQ to cook on, and small snacks. Please bring your own drinks and food to cook on the BBQ. We also plan to have an optional group meal on the last evening in one of the local pubs/restaurants in Braemar, at additional cost.  Photos: taken by event leaders and permission to use granted to OutdoorLads.",
